1,Appeal (civil) 6621 of 1995,I.T.C. LIMITED,COLLECTOR OF CENTRAL EXCISE BOMBAY,26/11/2002,SYED SHAH MOHAMMED QUADRI & ARIJIT PASAYAT,"2002 Supp(4) SCR 361 The following Order of the Court was delivered: The appellant-assessee is common in these appeals which relate to the same period, namely, 1986 to 1988, but arise out of orders of different Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunals (for short, ’the Tribunal’) and pertain to the jurisdiction of different original authorities. Civil Appeal No. 6621 of 1995 is from the common order of the Tribunal, Bench at New Delhi, in Final order Nos. 76-77/94-C and Misc. order No.44/ 94-C dated February 28, 1994. That order was followed by the Tribunal Bench ,at Bombay in Final Order No. E/616/98-C in Appeal No.792/94-C dated August 21, 1998, from which Civil Appeal No. 498 of 1999 arises. The common question that arises in these appeals is: whether parts of cigarette packets-’slides’ and ’slits’ are excisable goods within the meaning of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. The facts, which led to the filing of Civil Appeal No. 6621 of 1995, may be noticed here. The appellant filed classification list showing ’slides’ under heading 4818. 19 at ’nil’ duty. By notice dated 3rd April, 1986, the Superintendent of Central Excise required the appellant to show cause as to why ’slides’ should not be classified under sub-heading 4818.90. On 17th April, 1986, the appellant replied to the show-cause notice justifying classification as claimed by it. The contention of the appellant was rejected by the Assistant Collector, Central Excise. In appeal before the Collector (Appeals) , opportunity was given for oral hearing as also for filing the synopsis of submissions. In the synopsis of submissions, the appellant took the plea that ’slides’ were not excisable. However, that point was not adverted to by the Collector (Appeals), who held that no manufacturing process was involved in the preparation of ’slides’ and they were not marketable. However, he found that ’slides’ could be classified under sub heading 4818.90 and dismissed the appeal on February 11, 1988. Aggrieved by that order, the appellant and the Revenue preferred appeals before the Principal Bench of the Tribunal. The said Bench did not specifically record any finding with regard to the manufacturing process; marketability of ’slides’ was assumed on the ground that they bear different name and are covered by sub-heading 4818.90 and, thus, dismissed the appeals by order dated 28th February, 1994, which was followed by the Tribunal Bench at Bombay in regard to both ’slides’ and ’slits’ in the order under appeal in Civil Appeal no. 498 of 1999 dated 21st August, 1998. Thus, the classification of ’slides’ and ’slits’ is in issue in these appeals. Mr. S. Ganesh, learned senior counsel appearing for the assessee, has contended that as the Tribunal did not record any finding in regard to the   of 2 manufacturing process and that the finding in regard to marketability is based on surmises and not on any material, therefore, the orders under appeal are liable to be set aside, so the appeals may be remanded to the Tribunal for fresh disposal. Mr. A.K. Ganguli, learned senior counsel appearing for the Revenue, on the other hand, submits that the question of excisability of ’slides’ and ’slits’ was not raised in reply to the show-cause notice by the assessee; it was raised for the first time in the synopsis of submissions, therefore, the evidence with regard to the process of manufacture as well as marketability could not be placed before the original authority and that on the material before the Tribunal, findings recorded are correct. Though we find sufficient force in the submission of Mr. A.K. Ganguli, learned senior counsel appearing for the Revenue, that the question of excisability of ’slides’ and ’slits’ was not taken in reply to the show cause notice, yet, having regard to the fact that the question was raised in the synopsis of submissions before the appellate authority but was not dealt with specifically by it; further, it was urged before the Tribunal also and no objection was taken as to the maintainability of the contention on the ground that it was not raised before the original authority, we do not consider it appropriate to reject the appeals on that ground. In our view, interests of justice would be met if the orders under appeal, confirming the orders of Collector (Appeals), which do not specifically record the material finding, are set aside and the cases are remanded to any of the appellate authorities for disposal of the cases afresh, after giving opportunities to both the parties to lead evidence, if any. We, therefore, set aside the orders under challenge in these appeals, remand the cases to the Commissioner (Appeals), Meerut-I, Uttar Pradesh, who shall dispose of the appeals, in the light of the observations contained hereinabove and in accordance with law. In as much the necessity of remanding the cases has arisen because of the assessee not taking the plea before the original authority, we direct the assessee to pay costs to the respondent, quantified at Rupees fifteen thousand within two weeks. The civil appeals are, accordingly, allowed","2002 Supp(4) SCR 361 The following Order of the Court was delivered: The appellant-assessee is common in these appeals which relate to the same period, namely, 1986 to 1988, but arise out of orders of different Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunals (for short, ’the Tribunal’) and pertain to the jurisdiction of different original authorities.

2,Appeal (crl.) 1333-1334 of 1999,STATE OF U.P.,SHIV KUMAR & ORS,20/4/2005,B.P. SINGH & ARUN KUMAR,"B.P.SINGH, J. These appeals have been preferred by the State of Uttar Pradesh against the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Criminal Appeal No.1761 of 1980 dated 19.3.1999. By its impugned judgment and order, the High Court allowed the appeal preferred by the respondents and acquitted them of the charge under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC. Earlier, the respondents were tried by the IV Addl.Sessions Judge, Fatehpur in Session Trial No.172/80, who by judgment and order dated 12th August, 1980 convicted them of the offence under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced them to imprisonment for life. The case of the prosecution is that on 26.2.1980, Rudrapal Pandey (deceased) requested his nephew Ram Bahadur (PW-1) to take his wife Smt.Shyampati to village Haswa from where they were to board a bus to Fatehpur. They proposed to go to Fatehpur to consult a doctor since the said Smt. Shyampati was suffering from headache etc. The case of the prosecution is that Ram Bahadur (PW-1) along with his aunt proceeded towards village Haswa. Later, the deceased Rudrapal Pandey followed them. According to the prosecution, while proceeding towards village Haswa, the deceased Rudrapal Pandey requested Daulat Singh (PW-2) to accompany him. When they reached near village Aswan Baxpur, all the respondents came armed with firearms and surrounded the deceased. The respondent Shiv Kumar was armed with a gun while the remaining three were armed with pistols. The respondents Shiv Kumar and Amar Singh fired one shot each from their gun and pistol respectively. Though the deceased attempted to run away, he was prevented by respondents Ram Lakhan and Ram Kumar from doing so by pushing him in the canal. Thereafter, Ram Lakhan and Ram Kumar fired one shot each from their pistols. The accused thereafter ran away and an alarm was raised by Ram Bahadur. The motive suggested by the prosecution was that one Barjor Singh, uncle of the respondent Shiv Kumar, had been murdered and in that case Daulat Singh (PW-2) and his nephew Surajbali were the accused. In that case, the deceased Rudrapal Pandey was doing parvi on behalf of Daulat Singh (PW-2). This was the enmity which resulted in the murder of Rudrapal Pandey. The Trial Court relying upon the testimony of PW-1 (Ram Bahadur) and PW-2 (Daulat Singh) convicted the respondents. The High Court has found their evidence to be unreliable and has, therefore, acquitted the respondents. So far as Ram Bahadur (PW-1) is concerned, the specific allegation made by him was that the respondent Shiv Kumar fired at the deceased from his gun hitting him on his back, meaning thereby that he fired at the deceased from behind. The medical evidence is to the effect that on the back of the deceased, there was only an exit wound and there was no entry wound on the back of the deceased. Apparently, the alleged eye witness Ram Bahadur (PW-1) had not seen the actual occurrence and on finding an injury on the back of the deceased, he stated that the gun shot fired by the respondent Shiv Kumar hit the deceased on his back. It also appears from the record that though all the four respondents were said to have fired from their weapons, only two wounds of entry were found on the   of 2 chest of the deceased. So far as the witness Daulat Singh (PW-2) is concerned, the High Court doubted his presence because if he had been present on the spot, the respondents would not have spared him. This was because he was the person who is said to have committed the murder of the uncle of respondent Shiv Kumar. The deceased Rudrapal Pandey was only his pairokar. The evidence on record disclosed that he was standing five to six paces away from the deceased. The evidence on record also discloses that there was no obstruction between Daulat Singh (PW-2) and the respondents which may have prevented the respondents from firing at him. PW-1 (Ram Bahadur) does not say that Daulat Singh (PW-2) was with his uncle when he left his house. Daulat Singh (PW-2) has deposed that while going to village Haswa, the deceased had requested him to accompany him. There was no other reason for Daulat Singh (PW-2) to accompany the deceased on the fateful day. The High Court has further noticed that Smt. Shyampati was not even examined as a witness. The case of the respondents is that the whole story about Smt. Shyampati and PW-1 (Ram Bahadur) going to village Haswa is false and that neither of them were present when the incident took place. The failure of the prosecution to examine Smt. Shyampati at the trial was another circumstance which supported the prosecution case. Having considered the entire evidence before us, we are also not satisfied about the truthfulness of these two witnesses and their evidence leaves an element of doubt in our mind. The High Court has given to the respondents the benefit of doubt. We find no reason to disturb the finding recorded by the High Court. We find no merit in these appeals and the same are accordingly dismissed.","B.P.SINGH, J.

3,Appeal (crl.) 981 of 2001,SATYA NARAYAN SHARMA,STATE OF RAJASTHAN,25/9/2001,S.N. Variava,"S. N. VARIAVA, J. Leave granted. Heard parties. This Appeal is against an Order dated 25th April, 2001. By this Order a Criminal Miscellaneous Petition, under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, for quashing an Order dated 8th July, 1994 passed by a Special Judge constituted under the Prevention of Corruption Act (hereinafter called the said Act) has been dismissed. On 8th July, 1984 the Trial Court took cognizance against the Appellant for offences punishable under Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the I.P.C. and Section 5(2) of the said Act. The Appellant then approached the High Court with Miscellaneous Petition No. 578 of 1984 and got a stay of the trial. Having obtained a stay of the trial the Miscellaneous Petition was got adjourned. from time to time. By this method the Appellant has successfully delayed trial for 7 years. We find that what has happened in this case is happening in a large number of matters. Corruption in public offices is becoming rampant. When public servants are sought to be prosecuted under the said Act, by filing revisions under Section 397 Criminal Procedure Code or by filing petitions under Section 482 Criminal Procedure Code, stay of the trials are obtained and parties successfully manage to delay the trials. The stays are granted by Courts without considering and/or in contravention of Section 19(3)(c) of the said Act. This has an adverse effect on combating corruption amongst public servants. It has therefore become necessary to reiterate the law. We have thus heard this Petition only on the question of law as to whether or not trials under the Prevention of Corruption Act could be stayed. Mr. Shishodia submitted that by virtue of Section 27 of the said Act, the High Court can exercise all the powers of appeal and revision under the Criminal Procedure Code as if the Court of the Special Judge were a Court of Sessions. He further submitted that Sections 22 and 23 of the said Act make it clear that the Criminal Procedure Code would apply to proceedings before the Special Judge in relation to an offence punishable under the said Act. Mr. Shishodia submitted that the inherent jurisdiction of the High   of 4 Court under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code was distinct from its revisional jurisdiction. He submitted that the Special Court (under the said Act) was subordinate to the High Court. He submitted that the inherent power, vested in a High Court was not circumvented by the limitations which are there whilst exercising revisional powers. He submitted that the power to pass an interim order, like a stay order, was part of the inherent power of the Court. He submitted that this must necessarily be so as otherwise the Court could not effectively exercise the jurisdiction vested in it. In support of this last submission, he relied upon the case of Income Tax Officer vs. M.K. Mohammed Kunhi, 1969 (2) S.C.R. 65. This was a case under the Income Tax Act. Certain amounts were imposed as penalty upon the assessee for concealment of income and for furnishing inaccurate particulars. The assessee preferred appeals and prayed for stay of recovery of the penalties. The Tribunal declined to grant stay on the ground that it had no power to do so. The High Court held that the Tribunal had the inherent power to stay and directed the Tribunal to dispose of the application for stay in accordance with law. In appeal by the Income Tax Officer, this Court confirmed the findings of the High Court that the Tribunal had power to stay recovery. This Court held that the power of stay was incidental to the appellate jurisdiction of the Court. It must immediately be noted that there was no statutory provision barring grant of stay. Mr. Shishodia further submitted that both the High Courts and this Court have time and again exercised inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Criminal Procedure Code to quash proceedings even under the said Act. He submitted that it takes a number of years for matters to reach hearing. He submitted that it was absolutely necessary that, during the pendency of such proceedings, there should be a stay of the trial. He submitted that otherwise there would an anomalous position inasmuch as the trial may conclude before the High Court has examined the legality of the charge itself. Mr. Shishodia next submitted that the expression ""no court"" in Section 19 of the said Act would not include the High Court. He submitted that it only apply to a Court which had revisional jurisdiction over the Special Court. He submitted that many of the Judges of the Special Court were Assistant Sessions Judges. He submitted that the revisional power would thus be exercised by the Sessions Court. Mr. Shishodia next submitted that Section 19(3)(c) applies only to the revisional powers as exercised under Section 397 Criminal Procedure Code and not to the inherent jurisdiction, which a High Court exercises under Section 482 Criminal Procedure Code. On the other hand the learned Solicitor General points out the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The relevant portion of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 reads as follows : ""2. The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, was amended in 1964 based on the recommendations of the Santhanam Committee. There are provisions in Chapter IX of the Indian Penal Code to deal with public servants and those who abet them by way of criminal misconduct. There are also provisions in the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944, to enable attachment of ill-gotton wealth obtained through corrupt means, including from transferees of such wealth. The Act seeks to incorporate all these provisions with modifications so as to make the provisions more effective in combating corruption among public servants. 3. The Act inter alia, envisages widening the scope of the definition of the expression ""public servant"", incorporation of  Page 3 of 4 offences under sections 161 to 165A of the Indian Penal Code, enhancement of penalties provided for these offences and incorporation of a provision that the order of the trial court upholding the grant of sanction for prosecution would be final if it has not already been challenged and the trial has commenced. In order to expedite the proceedings, provisions for day-to-day trial of cases and prohibitory provisions with regard to grant of say and exercise of powers of a revision on interlocutory orders have also been included."" (emphasis supplied) The learned Solicitor General Salve submitted that inherent jurisdiction of a Court could not be exercised if there was a specific provision for redressal of the grievances of the aggrieved party or against an express bar of law engrafted in any other provision. He further submitted that inherent jurisdiction had to be very sparingly exercised only to prevent abuse of process of any Court or to secure the ends of justice. In support of this submission he relied upon the cases of Madhu Limaye vs. The State of Maharashtra reported in 1977 (4) S.C.C. 551, Janata Deal vs. H.S. Chowdhary & others reported in 1992 (4) S.C.C. 305 and Indra Sawhney vs. Union of India and others reported in 2000 (1) S.C.C. 168. We have heard the parties. Section 19(3)(c) of the said Act reads as follows : ""(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974). xxx xxx xxx (c) no court shall stay the proceedings under this Act on any other ground and no court shall exercise the powers of revision in relation to any interlocutory order passed in any inquiry, trial, appeal or other proceedings."" It is thus to be seen that this Section provides: (a) that no court should stay the proceedings under the Act on any ground and (b) that no court shall exercise the powers of revision in relation to any interlocutory order passed in any inquiry, trial, appeal or other proceedings. To be noted that (b) above is identical to Section 397(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code which deals with revisional power of the Court. If Section 19 was only to deal with revisional powers then the portion set out in (b) above, would have been sufficient. The legislature has, therefore, by adding the words no court shall stay the proceedings under this Act on any other ground clearly indicated that no stay could be granted by use of any power on any ground. This therefore would apply even where a Court is exercising inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code. There is another reason also why the submission that, Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption would not apply to the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, cannot be accepted. Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code starts with the words Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code. Thus the inherent power can be exercised even if there was a contrary provision in the Criminal Procedure Code. Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code does not provide that inherent jurisdiction can be exercised notwithstanding any other provision contained in any other enactment. Thus if an enactment contains a specific bar then inherent jurisdiction cannot be exercised to get over that bar. As has been pointed out in the cases of Madhu Limaye vs. The State of Maharashtra reported in 1977 (4) S.C.C. 551, Janata Deal vs. H.S. Chowdhary & others, reported in 1992 (4) S.C.C. 305 and Indra Sawhney vs. Union of India and others reported in 2000 (1) S.C.C. 168, the inherent jurisdiction cannot be resorted to if there was a specific provision or there is an express bar of law. We see no substance in the submission that Section 19 would not  Page 4 of 4 apply to a High Court. Section 5(3) of the said Act shows that the Special Court under the said Act is a Court of Session. Therefore the power of revision and/or the inherent jurisdiction can only be exercised by the High Court. Thus in cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act there can be no stay of trials. We clarify that we are not saying that proceedings under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code cannot be adapted. In appropriate cases proceedings under Section 482 can be adapted. However, even if petition under Section 482 Criminal Procedure Code is entertained there can be no stay of trials under the said Act. It is then for the party to convince the concerned Court to expedite the hearing of that petition. However merely because the concerned Court is not in a position to take up the petition for hearing would be no ground for staying the trial even temporarily. In this Appeal we see no reason to interfere with the impugned Order. The Appeal stands dismissed. We clarify that merits of the case have not been argued before us. We are thus not expressing any opinion on the merits of the case. As the trial has already been delayed, we direct that now the trial be taken up for hearing on a day to day basis and the same be concluded within a period of 6 months from today. It has been brought to our attention that in a large number of cases stays have been granted by the High Courts in matters under the Prevention of Corruption Act, even though there is a specific bar against the grant of any stay. We therefore direct the Registrars of all the High Courts to list all cases in which such stay is granted before the Court concerned so that appropriate action can be taken by that Court in the light of this decision. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this order to the Registrars of all the High Courts. There shall be no Order as to costs. J. (S. N. VARIAVA) September 25, 2001","S. N. VARIAVA, J. Leave granted. Heard parties. This Appeal is against an Order dated 25th April, 2001. By this Order a Criminal Miscellaneous Petition, under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, for quashing an Order dated 8th July, 1994 passed by a Special Judge constituted under the Prevention of Corruption Act (hereinafter called the said Act) has been dismissed.

Mr. Shishodia submitted that by virtue of Section 27 of the said Act, the High Court can exercise all the powers of appeal and revision under the Criminal Procedure Code as if the Court of the Special Judge were a Court of Sessions. He further submitted that Sections 22 and 23 of the said Act make it clear that the Criminal Procedure Code would apply to proceedings before the Special Judge in relation to an offence punishable under the said Act. Mr. Shishodia submitted that the inherent jurisdiction of the High   of 4 Court under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code was distinct from its revisional jurisdiction. He submitted that the Special Court (under the said Act) was subordinate to the High Court. He submitted that the inherent power, vested in a High Court was not circumvented by the limitations which are there whilst exercising revisional powers. He submitted that the power to pass an interim order, like a stay order, was part of the inherent power of the Court. He submitted that this must necessarily be so as otherwise the Court could not effectively exercise the jurisdiction vested in it. In support of this last submission, he relied upon the case of Income Tax Officer vs. M.K. Mohammed Kunhi, 1969 (2) S.C.R. 65. This was a case under the Income Tax Act. Certain amounts were imposed as penalty upon the assessee for concealment of income and for furnishing inaccurate particulars. The assessee preferred appeals and prayed for stay of recovery of the penalties. The Tribunal declined to grant stay on the ground that it had no power to do so. The High Court held that the Tribunal had the inherent power to stay and directed the Tribunal to dispose of the application for stay in accordance with law. In appeal by the Income Tax Officer, this Court confirmed the findings of the High Court that the Tribunal had power to stay recovery. This Court held that the power of stay was incidental to the appellate jurisdiction of the Court. It must immediately be noted that there was no statutory provision barring grant of stay. Mr. Shishodia further submitted that both the High Courts and this Court have time and again exercised inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Criminal Procedure Code to quash proceedings even under the said Act. He submitted that it takes a number of years for matters to reach hearing. He submitted that it was absolutely necessary that, during the pendency of such proceedings, there should be a stay of the trial. He submitted that otherwise there would an anomalous position inasmuch as the trial may conclude before the High Court has examined the legality of the charge itself. Mr. Shishodia next submitted that the expression ""no court"" in Section 19 of the said Act would not include the High Court. He submitted that it only apply to a Court which had revisional jurisdiction over the Special Court. He submitted that many of the Judges of the Special Court were Assistant Sessions Judges. He submitted that the revisional power would thus be exercised by the Sessions Court. Mr. Shishodia next submitted that Section 19(3)(c) applies only to the revisional powers as exercised under Section 397 Criminal Procedure Code and not to the inherent jurisdiction, which a High Court exercises under Section 482 Criminal Procedure Code. On the other hand the learned Solicitor General points out the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The relevant portion of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 reads as follows : ""2. The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, was amended in 1964 based on the recommendations of the Santhanam Committee. There are provisions in Chapter IX of the Indian Penal Code to deal with public servants and those who abet them by way of criminal misconduct. There are also provisions in the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944, to enable attachment of ill-gotton wealth obtained through corrupt means, including from transferees of such wealth. The Act seeks to incorporate all these provisions with modifications so as to make the provisions more effective in combating corruption among public servants. 3. The Act inter alia, envisages widening the scope of the definition of the expression ""public servant"", incorporation of  Page 3 of 4 offences under sections 161 to 165A of the Indian Penal Code, enhancement of penalties provided for these offences and incorporation of a provision that the order of the trial court upholding the grant of sanction for prosecution would be final if it has not already been challenged and the trial has commenced. In order to expedite the proceedings, provisions for day-to-day trial of cases and prohibitory provisions with regard to grant of say and exercise of powers of a revision on interlocutory orders have also been included."" (emphasis supplied) The learned Solicitor General Salve submitted that inherent jurisdiction of a Court could not be exercised if there was a specific provision for redressal of the grievances of the aggrieved party or against an express bar of law engrafted in any other provision. He further submitted that inherent jurisdiction had to be very sparingly exercised only to prevent abuse of process of any Court or to secure the ends of justice. In support of this submission he relied upon the cases of Madhu Limaye vs. The State of Maharashtra reported in 1977 (4) S.C.C. 551, Janata Deal vs. H.S. Chowdhary & others reported in 1992 (4) S.C.C. 305 and Indra Sawhney vs. Union of India and others reported in 2000 (1) S.C.C. 168. We have heard the parties. Section 19(3)(c) of the said Act reads as follows : ""(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974). xxx xxx xxx (c) no court shall stay the proceedings under this Act on any other ground and no court shall exercise the powers of revision in relation to any interlocutory order passed in any inquiry, trial, appeal or other proceedings."" It is thus to be seen that this Section provides: (a) that no court should stay the proceedings under the Act on any ground and (b) that no court shall exercise the powers of revision in relation to any interlocutory order passed in any inquiry, trial, appeal or other proceedings. To be noted that (b) above is identical to Section 397(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code which deals with revisional power of the Court. If Section 19 was only to deal with revisional powers then the portion set out in (b) above, would have been sufficient. The legislature has, therefore, by adding the words no court shall stay the proceedings under this Act on any other ground clearly indicated that no stay could be granted by use of any power on any ground. This therefore would apply even where a Court is exercising inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code. There is another reason also why the submission that, Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption would not apply to the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, cannot be accepted. Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code starts with the words Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code. Thus the inherent power can be exercised even if there was a contrary provision in the Criminal Procedure Code. Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code does not provide that inherent jurisdiction can be exercised notwithstanding any other provision contained in any other enactment. Thus if an enactment contains a specific bar then inherent jurisdiction cannot be exercised to get over that bar. As has been pointed out in the cases of Madhu Limaye vs. The State of Maharashtra reported in 1977 (4) S.C.C. 551, Janata Deal vs. H.S. Chowdhary & others, reported in 1992 (4) S.C.C. 305 and Indra Sawhney vs. Union of India and others reported in 2000 (1) S.C.C. 168, the inherent jurisdiction cannot be resorted to if there was a specific provision or there is an express bar of law. We see no substance in the submission that Section 19 would not  Page 4 of 4 apply to a High Court. Section 5(3) of the said Act shows that the Special Court under the said Act is a Court of Session. Therefore the power of revision and/or the inherent jurisdiction can only be exercised by the High Court. Thus in cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act there can be no stay of trials. We clarify that we are not saying that proceedings under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code cannot be adapted. In appropriate cases proceedings under Section 482 can be adapted. However, even if petition under Section 482 Criminal Procedure Code is entertained there can be no stay of trials under the said Act. It is then for the party to convince the concerned Court to expedite the hearing of that petition. However merely because the concerned Court is not in a position to take up the petition for hearing would be no ground for staying the trial even temporarily. In this Appeal we see no reason to interfere with the impugned Order. The Appeal stands dismissed. We clarify that merits of the case have not been argued before us. We are thus not expressing any opinion on the merits of the case. As the trial has already been delayed, we direct that now the trial be taken up for hearing on a day to day basis and the same be concluded within a period of 6 months from today. It has been brought to our attention that in a large number of cases stays have been granted by the High Courts in matters under the Prevention of Corruption Act, even though there is a specific bar against the grant of any stay. We therefore direct the Registrars of all the High Courts to list all cases in which such stay is granted before the Court concerned so that appropriate action can be taken by that Court in the light of this decision. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this order to the Registrars of all the High Courts. There shall be no Order as to costs. J. (S. N. VARIAVA) September 25, 2001"

SRIKRISHNA,"J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP ) Nos. 11344-11349/2004) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. When one talks of freedom fighters’ the normal image that comes to one’s mind is a person who had suffered physically and mentally for unshackling chains of foreign rule in our country. The normal reaction when one sees such person is one of reverence, regard and respect. The brave courageous deeds of these persons is a distinctive part of India’s fight for freedom. Many persons lost their lives, many were injured and large number of such persons had languished in jails for various periods. The common thread which must have passed through the minds of these people is their sole objective to see that their motherland has a government of its own, free from foreign rule. But these images get shattered when one hears that with a view to gain financially, vague documents have been produced, false claims of participation in the freedom movement have been made. It is a sad reflection on the moral values of the citizens of our country that a large number of cases have surfaced where it has been established that people who were not even born when the freedom fight was on or the country got independence or were toddlers when the country got independence have applied for and managed to get ""Sammanpatra"", pensionary and other allied benefits. The appeals at hand deal with such allegations. This is ""Asanman"" (disrespect) to the whole country and such dishonourable ventures have to be dealt with sternness to send out a message that they are not freedom fighters, but are traitors sullying the name of freedom fight. In these appeals challenge is to the judgment delivered by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court at Aurangabad Bench by which several writ petitions were disposed of. Writ petitions came to be filed before the High Court challenging the grant of benefits to such phantoms masquerading to be freedom fighters. The basic allegation in the writ petitions was that in the Beed District of Maharashtra, there were large number of persons who had been   of 8 granted pensionary benefits under the Freedom Fighters’ Pension Scheme (in short the ’Scheme’). Such writ petitions were purported to have been filed by persons in public interest. In one case the petition was filed by a freedom fighter who claimed that he was surprised to see the number of persons falsely claiming to be freedom fighters. The prayer essentially was to hold detailed enquiry and to cancel the pensionary benefits and for a direction to recover the amounts which had already been paid along with the prayer for initiation of criminal proceedings against the bogus claimants. It was pointed out that in as many as 354 bogus claims have been allowed in the concerned district. Such persons were availing pensionary and other benefits which are to be availed only by genuine freedom fighters. It was highlighted in the petitions that some of the so called freedom fighters were all of tender age and/or were not born when freedom struggle was fought. In respect of others it was alleged that they managed to get freedom fighters’ pension by submitting forged, false and fabricated documents. A Division Bench of the High Court taking cognizance of the petitions and the serious allegations made therein constituted a three-member Enquiry Committee headed by a retired Judge of the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal and two other members who were practising advocates from the Beed District. They were required to enquire into the claims of so called freedom fighters. The Committee was constituted by order dated 3.12.2002. Allegations were made that out of 3000 applications filed, 354 were ineligible and the High Power Committee of the State had wrongly recommended payment of pension holding them to be freedom fighters. It is stated that there are two Committees i.e. District Level Committee (District Gaurav Committee) and State Level High Power Committee which are required to examine the claims. The High Court after perusing the 3000 applications retained the files of these suspected 354 cases. Order passed prior to the appointment of the Enquiry Committee revealed that the Court prima facie was of the view that in 26 cases the persons were less than 10 years of age when the freedom struggle was fought. The Enquiry Committee submitted its report. After the enquiry report was submitted, the High Court passed orders at various stages. It appears that some of the persons whose names were included in the list of 354 suspected beneficiaries filed the writ petitions. While the High Court directed the Collector, Beed District not to release pension to these freedom fighters whose cases were covered by the Enquiry Committee until further orders. The said order of the High Court was also made applicable to the freedom fighters whose civil writ applications were already rejected. Aggrieved by the order, Special Leave Petition was filed before this Court which was disposed of by the following order: ""Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners. We decline to grant permission to file the Special Leave petitions but give liberty to the petitioners to file independent writ petitions, challenging the order of the Enquiry Committee, if so desired. At this stage, the learned counsel for the petitioners states that certain observations made in the impugned order will come in their way and/or affect the case of  Page 3 of 8 the petitioners on merits. We make it clear that the observations made in the impugned order shall not affect the merits of the case of the petitioners in the writ petitions that may be filed."" After hearing the cases, the High Court by the impugned judgment held that the foundation on which the allegations were made was really factually incorrect. The High Court took five sample cases and came to hold that the report of the Enquiry Committee was not to be accepted and accordingly dismissed the writ petitions. It was of the view that the documents produced were sufficient to substantiate the claims. It found that the parameters fixed by this Court for dealing with the applications for freedom fighters’ pension were fulfilled and therefore no interference was called for. It also held that the petitions filed as ’Public Interest Litigation’ were not really so. It was observed that the enquiries conducted before grant of pension cannot be upset by contrary findings recorded by the Enquiry Committee and, therefore, the petitions challenging grant of freedom fighters’ pension were dismissed while the petitions questioning correctness of the Enquiry Committee appointed by the High Court were allowed. In support of the appeals, Mr. A.V. Savant, learned senior counsel submitted that the approach of the High Court is clearly erroneous. The fact that it took up 5 sample cases itself shows that the High Court was not adopting the proper course. Even if it is accepted for the sake of argument that the persons covered by the five sample cases were genuine freedom fighters that does not necessarily lead to an inference that all others were also genuine freedom fighters. After elaborate analysis of the materials the Committee came to hold that the claims were bogus and tainted with fraud. The High Court should not have lightly interfered with the findings on suppositions and presumptions. Per contra, learned counsel for the beneficiaries whose eligibility was questioned submitted that all relevant documents had been submitted, were scrutinized and thereafter pension was granted and, therefore, the Committee appointed by the High Court was not justified in lightly brushing aside the intrinsic value of the documents produced to hold otherwise. The object of the scheme was highlighted by this Court in Mukundlal Bhandari v. Union of India and Ors. (AIR 1993 SC 2127) ""The object was to honour and where it was necessary also to mitigate the sufferings of those who had given their all for the country in the hour of its need. In fact, many of those who do not have sufficient income to maintain themselves refuse to take benefit of it since they consider it as an affront to the sense of patriotism with which they plunged in the freedom struggle. The spirit of the scheme being both to assist and honour the needy and acknowledge the valuable  Page 4 of 8 sacrifices made, it would be contrary to its spirit to convert it into some kind of a programme of compensation. Yet that may be the result if the benefit is directed to be given retrospectively whatever the date the application is made. The Scheme should retain its high objective with which it was motivated..."" Again in Gurdial Singh v. Union of India (2001 AIR SCW 3843) this Court observed: ""It should not be forgotten that the persons intended to be covered by the scheme have suffered for the country about half a century back and had not expected to be rewarded for the imprisonment suffered by them. Once the country has decided to honour such freedom fighters, the bureaucrats entrusted with the job of examining the cases of such freedom fighters are expected to keep in mind the purpose and object of the scheme...."" We are in respectful agreement with the view expressed in Mukundlal’s and Gurdial Singh’s cases (supra). As noted at the threshold, the genuine freedom fighters deserve to be treated with reverence, respect and honour. But at the same time it cannot be lost sight of that people who had no role to play in the freedom struggle should not be permitted to benefit from the liberal approach required to be adopted in the case of the freedom fighters, most of whom in the normal course are septuagenarians and octogenarians. It baffles one, beyond comprehension, when claim is made by a person who was not even born during the freedom struggle to be a freedom fighter. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted a list which makes an interesting reading. Some of the beneficiaries were born in 1951 and some in 1955. Accepting claims of such persons to be freedom fighters would be making a mockery of the scheme which is intended for genuine freedom fighter. The approach of the High Court is clearly untenable. Sampling cannot be the method for determining the truth or otherwise of the allegations or claims made. Each case was required to be individually examined. On that score alone, the High Court’s judgment is vulnerable. Allegations made were to the effect that fraud has been practiced. By ""fraud"" is meant an intention to deceive; whether it is from any expectation of advantage to the party himself or from the ill will towards the other is immaterial. The expression ""fraud"" involves two elements, deceit and injury to the person deceived. Injury is something other than economic loss, that is, deprivation of property, whether movable or immovable or of money and it will include and any harm whatever caused to any person in body, mind, reputation or such others. In short, it is a non-economic or non-pecuniary loss. A benefit or advantage to the deceiver, will almost always call loss or detriment to the deceived. Even in those rare cases where there is a benefit or advantage to the deceiver, but no corresponding loss to the deceived, the second condition is satisfied. (See Dr. Vimla v. Delhi Administration (1963 Supp. 2 SCR 585) and Indian Bank v. Satyam Febres (India) Pvt. Ltd.  Page 5 of 8 (1996 (5) SCC 550). A ""fraud"" is an act of deliberate deception with the design of securing something by taking unfair advantage of another. It is a deception in order to gain by another’s loss. It is a cheating intended to get an advantage. (See S.P. Changalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath (1994 (1) SCC 1). ""Fraud"" as is well known vitiates every solemn act. Fraud and justice never dwell together. Fraud is a conduct either by letter or words, which includes the other person or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to the conduct of the former either by words or letter. It is also well settled that misrepresentation itself amounts to fraud. Indeed, innocent misrepresentation may also give reason to claim relief against fraud. A fraudulent misrepresentation is called deceit and consists in leading a man into damage by willfully or recklessly causing him to believe and act on falsehood. It is a fraud in law if a party makes representations, which he knows to be false, and injury enures therefrom although the motive from which the representations proceeded may not have been bad. An act of fraud on court is always viewed seriously. A collusion or conspiracy with a view to deprive the rights of the others in relation to a property would render the transaction void ab initio. Fraud and deception are synonymous. Although in a given case a deception may not amount to fraud, fraud is anathema to all equitable principles and any affair tainted with fraud cannot be perpetuated or saved by the application of any equitable doctrine including res judicata. (See Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi and Ors. (2003 (8) SCC 319). ""Fraud"" and collusion vitiate even the most solemn proceedings in any civilized system of jurisprudence. It is a concept descriptive of human conduct. Michael Levi likens a fraudster to Milton’s sorcerer, Comus, who exulted in his ability to, ’wing me into the easy hearted man and trap him into snares’. It has been defined as an act of trickery or deceit. In Webster’s Third New International Dictionary ""fraud"" in equity has been defined as an act or omission to act or concealment by which one person obtains an advantage against conscience over another or which equity or public policy forbids as being prejudicial to another. In Black’s Legal Dictionary, ""fraud"" is defined as an intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to him or surrender a legal right; a false representation of a matter of fact whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment of that which should have been disclosed, which deceives and is intended to deceive another so that he shall act upon it to his legal injury. In Concise Oxford Dictionary, it has been defined as criminal deception, use of false representation to gain unjust advantage; dishonest artifice or trick. According to Halsbury’s Laws of England, a representation is deemed to have been false, and therefore a misrepresentation, if it was at the material date false in substance and in fact. Section 17 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines ""fraud"" as act committed by a party to a contract with intent to deceive another. From dictionary meaning or even otherwise fraud arises out of deliberate active role of representator about a fact, which he knows to be untrue yet he succeeds in misleading the representee by making him believe it to be true. The representation to become fraudulent must be of fact with knowledge that it was false. In a leading English case i.e. Derry and Ors. v. Peek (1886-90) All ER 1 what constitutes  Page 6 of 8 ""fraud"" was described thus: (All ER p. 22 B-C) ""fraud"" is proved when it is shown that a false representation has been made (i) knowingly, or (ii) without belief in its truth, or (iii) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false"". But ""fraud"" in public law is not the same as ""fraud"" in private law. Nor can the ingredients, which establish ""fraud"" in commercial transaction, be of assistance in determining fraud in Administrative Law. It has been aptly observed by Lord Bridge in Khawaja v. Secretary of State for Home Deptt. (1983) 1 All ER 765, that it is dangerous to introduce maxims of common law as to effect of fraud while determining fraud in relation of statutory law. ""Fraud"" in relation to statute must be a colourable transaction to evade the provisions of a statute. ""If a statute has been passed for some one particular purpose, a court of law will not countenance any attempt which may be made to extend the operation of the Act to something else which is quite foreign to its object and beyond its scope. Present day concept of fraud on statute has veered round abuse of power or mala fide exercise of power. It may arise due to overstepping the limits of power or defeating the provision of statute by adopting subterfuge or the power may be exercised for extraneous or irrelevant considerations. The colour of fraud in public law or administration law, as it is developing, is assuming different shades. It arises from a deception committed by disclosure of incorrect facts knowingly and deliberately to invoke exercise of power and procure an order from an authority or tribunal. It must result in exercise of jurisdiction which otherwise would not have been exercised. The misrepresentation must be in relation to the conditions provided in a section on existence or non-existence of which the power can be exercised. But non-disclosure of a fact not required by a statute to be disclosed may not amount to fraud. Even in commercial transactions non-disclosure of every fact does not vitiate the agreement. ""In a contract every person must look for himself and ensures that he acquires the information necessary to avoid bad bargain. In public law the duty is not to deceive. (See Shrisht Dhawan (Smt.) v. M/s. Shaw Brothers, (1992 (1) SCC 534). In that case it was observed as follows: ""Fraud and collusion vitiate even the most solemn proceedings in any civilized system of jurisprudence. It is a concept descriptive of human conduct. Michael levi likens a fraudster to Milton’s sorcerer, Comus, who exulted in his ability to, ’wing me into the easy-hearted man and trap him into snares’.

The representation to become fraudulent must be of the fact with knowledge that it was false. In a leading English case Derry v. Peek [(1886-90) ALL ER Rep 1: (1889) 14 AC 337 (HL)] what constitutes fraud was described thus: (All Er p. 22 B-C) ’Fraud is proved when it is shown that a false representation has been made (i) knowingly, or (ii) without belief in its truth, or (iii) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false’."" This aspect of the matter has been considered recently by this Court in Roshan Deen v. Preeti Lal (2002 (1) SCC 100) Ram Preeti Yadav v. U.P. Board of High School and Intermediate Education (2003 (8) SCC 311), Ram Chandra Singh’s case (supra) and Ashok Leyland Ltd. v. State of T.N. and Another (2004 (3) SCC 1). Suppression of a material document would also amount to a fraud on the court. (see Gowrishankar v. Joshi Amba Shankar Family Trust (1996 (3) SCC 310) and S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu’s case (supra). ""Fraud"" is a conduct either by letter or words, which induces the other person or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to the conduct of the former either by words or letter. Although negligence is not fraud but it can be evidence on fraud; as observed in Ram Preeti Yadav’s case (supra). In Lazarus Estate Ltd. v. Beasley (1956) 1 QB 702, Lord Denning observed at pages 712 & 713, ""No judgment of a Court, no order of a Minister can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything."" In the same judgment Lord Parker LJ observed that fraud vitiates all transactions known to the law of however high a degree of solemnity. (page 722) These aspects were recently highlighted in the State of Andhra Pradesh and Anr. v. T. Suryachandr Rao (2005 (5) SCALE 621) To give finality to the controversy, we appoint Mr. Justice A.B. Palkar, a retired Judge of the Bombay High Court to examine the 354 cases. The relevant files shall be handed over to the Commission immediately. The Commission is requested to complete the verification within four months and submit its report to the State Government for necessary action. The claimants whose cases are to be examined shall be given opportunity to have their say before the Commission. The records of the Zilla Gaurav Samittee, High Power Committee and the Committee appointed by the High Court shall be examined by the Commission before issuing notice to he individual applicants to decide the acceptability or otherwise of the claims for freedom fighters’ pension. On getting report of the Commission, the State Government shall take necessary action. We make it clear that we have not expressed any  Page 8 of 8 opinion on the acceptability or otherwise of the claims as the Commission appointed by this Court shall examine those aspects. The Commission appointed by this Court shall be paid the same emoluments as are admissible to a sitting Judge of the High Court for the duration of its work, which we expect will be finished within a period of 4 months. The emoluments admissible to the Commission shall be paid by the State Government, apart from other expenses that may be incurred for functioning of the Commission. The appeals are allowed with no order as to costs.","J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP ) Nos. 11344-11349/2004) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted.

Writ petitions came to be filed before the High Court challenging the grant of benefits to such phantoms masquerading to be freedom fighters. The basic allegation in the writ petitions was that in the Beed District of Maharashtra, there were large number of persons who had been   of 8 granted pensionary benefits under the Freedom Fighters’ Pension Scheme (in short the ’Scheme’). Such writ petitions were purported to have been filed by persons in public interest. In one case the petition was filed by a freedom fighter who claimed that he was surprised to see the number of persons falsely claiming to be freedom fighters. The prayer essentially was to hold detailed enquiry and to cancel the pensionary benefits and for a direction to recover the amounts which had already been paid along with the prayer for initiation of criminal proceedings against the bogus claimants.

In respect of others it was alleged that they managed to get freedom fighters’ pension by submitting forged, false and fabricated documents. A Division Bench of the High Court taking cognizance of the petitions and the serious allegations made therein constituted a three-member Enquiry Committee headed by a retired Judge of the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal and two other members who were practising advocates from the Beed District. They were required to enquire into the claims of so called freedom fighters. The Committee was constituted by order dated 3.12.2002. Allegations were made that out of 3000 applications filed, 354 were ineligible and the High Power Committee of the State had wrongly recommended payment of pension holding them to be freedom fighters. It is stated that there are two Committees i.e. District Level Committee (District Gaurav Committee) and State Level High Power Committee which are required to examine the claims. The High Court after perusing the 3000 applications retained the files of these suspected 354 cases. Order passed prior to the appointment of the Enquiry Committee revealed that the Court prima facie was of the view that in 26 cases the persons were less than 10 years of age when the freedom struggle was fought. The Enquiry Committee submitted its report. After the enquiry report was submitted, the High Court passed orders at various stages. It appears that some of the persons whose names were included in the list of 354 suspected beneficiaries filed the writ petitions. While the High Court directed the Collector, Beed District not to release pension to these freedom fighters whose cases were covered by the Enquiry Committee until further orders. The said order of the High Court was also made applicable to the freedom fighters whose civil writ applications were already rejected. Aggrieved by the order, Special Leave Petition was filed before this Court which was disposed of by the following order: ""Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners. We decline to grant permission to file the Special Leave petitions but give liberty to the petitioners to file independent writ petitions, challenging the order of the Enquiry Committee, if so desired. At this stage, the learned counsel for the petitioners states that certain observations made in the impugned order will come in their way and/or affect the case of  Page 3 of 8 the petitioners on merits. We make it clear that the observations made in the impugned order shall not affect the merits of the case of the petitioners in the writ petitions that may be filed."" After hearing the cases, the High Court by the impugned judgment held that the foundation on which the allegations were made was really factually incorrect. The High Court took five sample cases and came to hold that the report of the Enquiry Committee was not to be accepted and accordingly dismissed the writ petitions. It was of the view that the documents produced were sufficient to substantiate the claims. It found that the parameters fixed by this Court for dealing with the applications for freedom fighters’ pension were fulfilled and therefore no interference was called for. It also held that the petitions filed as ’Public Interest Litigation’ were not really so. It was observed that the enquiries conducted before grant of pension cannot be upset by contrary findings recorded by the Enquiry Committee and, therefore, the petitions challenging grant of freedom fighters’ pension were dismissed while the petitions questioning correctness of the Enquiry Committee appointed by the High Court were allowed. In support of the appeals, Mr. A.V. Savant, learned senior counsel submitted that the approach of the High Court is clearly erroneous. The fact that it took up 5 sample cases itself shows that the High Court was not adopting the proper course. Even if it is accepted for the sake of argument that the persons covered by the five sample cases were genuine freedom fighters that does not necessarily lead to an inference that all others were also genuine freedom fighters. After elaborate analysis of the materials the Committee came to hold that the claims were bogus and tainted with fraud. The High Court should not have lightly interfered with the findings on suppositions and presumptions. Per contra, learned counsel for the beneficiaries whose eligibility was questioned submitted that all relevant documents had been submitted, were scrutinized and thereafter pension was granted and, therefore, the Committee appointed by the High Court was not justified in lightly brushing aside the intrinsic value of the documents produced to hold otherwise. The object of the scheme was highlighted by this Court in Mukundlal Bhandari v. Union of India and Ors. (AIR 1993 SC 2127) ""The object was to honour and where it was necessary also to mitigate the sufferings of those who had given their all for the country in the hour of its need. In fact, many of those who do not have sufficient income to maintain themselves refuse to take benefit of it since they consider it as an affront to the sense of patriotism with which they plunged in the freedom struggle. The spirit of the scheme being both to assist and honour the needy and acknowledge the valuable  Page 4 of 8 sacrifices made, it would be contrary to its spirit to convert it into some kind of a programme of compensation. Yet that may be the result if the benefit is directed to be given retrospectively whatever the date the application is made. The Scheme should retain its high objective with which it was motivated..."" Again in Gurdial Singh v. Union of India (2001 AIR SCW 3843) this Court observed: ""It should not be forgotten that the persons intended to be covered by the scheme have suffered for the country about half a century back and had not expected to be rewarded for the imprisonment suffered by them. Once the country has decided to honour such freedom fighters, the bureaucrats entrusted with the job of examining the cases of such freedom fighters are expected to keep in mind the purpose and object of the scheme...."" We are in respectful agreement with the view expressed in Mukundlal’s and Gurdial Singh’s cases (supra). As noted at the threshold, the genuine freedom fighters deserve to be treated with reverence, respect and honour. But at the same time it cannot be lost sight of that people who had no role to play in the freedom struggle should not be permitted to benefit from the liberal approach required to be adopted in the case of the freedom fighters, most of whom in the normal course are septuagenarians and octogenarians. It baffles one, beyond comprehension, when claim is made by a person who was not even born during the freedom struggle to be a freedom fighter. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted a list which makes an interesting reading. Some of the beneficiaries were born in 1951 and some in 1955. Accepting claims of such persons to be freedom fighters would be making a mockery of the scheme which is intended for genuine freedom fighter. The approach of the High Court is clearly untenable. Sampling cannot be the method for determining the truth or otherwise of the allegations or claims made. Each case was required to be individually examined. On that score alone, the High Court’s judgment is vulnerable. Allegations made were to the effect that fraud has been practiced. By ""fraud"" is meant an intention to deceive; whether it is from any expectation of advantage to the party himself or from the ill will towards the other is immaterial. The expression ""fraud"" involves two elements, deceit and injury to the person deceived. Injury is something other than economic loss, that is, deprivation of property, whether movable or immovable or of money and it will include and any harm whatever caused to any person in body, mind, reputation or such others. In short, it is a non-economic or non-pecuniary loss. A benefit or advantage to the deceiver, will almost always call loss or detriment to the deceived. Even in those rare cases where there is a benefit or advantage to the deceiver, but no corresponding loss to the deceived, the second condition is satisfied. (See Dr. Vimla v. Delhi Administration (1963 Supp. 2 SCR 585) and Indian Bank v. Satyam Febres (India) Pvt. Ltd.  Page 5 of 8 (1996 (5) SCC 550). A ""fraud"" is an act of deliberate deception with the design of securing something by taking unfair advantage of another. It is a deception in order to gain by another’s loss. It is a cheating intended to get an advantage. (See S.P. Changalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath (1994 (1) SCC 1). ""Fraud"" as is well known vitiates every solemn act. Fraud and justice never dwell together. Fraud is a conduct either by letter or words, which includes the other person or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to the conduct of the former either by words or letter. It is also well settled that misrepresentation itself amounts to fraud. Indeed, innocent misrepresentation may also give reason to claim relief against fraud. A fraudulent misrepresentation is called deceit and consists in leading a man into damage by willfully or recklessly causing him to believe and act on falsehood. It is a fraud in law if a party makes representations, which he knows to be false, and injury enures therefrom although the motive from which the representations proceeded may not have been bad. An act of fraud on court is always viewed seriously. A collusion or conspiracy with a view to deprive the rights of the others in relation to a property would render the transaction void ab initio. Fraud and deception are synonymous. Although in a given case a deception may not amount to fraud, fraud is anathema to all equitable principles and any affair tainted with fraud cannot be perpetuated or saved by the application of any equitable doctrine including res judicata. (See Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi and Ors. (2003 (8) SCC 319). ""Fraud"" and collusion vitiate even the most solemn proceedings in any civilized system of jurisprudence. It is a concept descriptive of human conduct. Michael Levi likens a fraudster to Milton’s sorcerer, Comus, who exulted in his ability to, ’wing me into the easy hearted man and trap him into snares’. It has been defined as an act of trickery or deceit. In Webster’s Third New International Dictionary ""fraud"" in equity has been defined as an act or omission to act or concealment by which one person obtains an advantage against conscience over another or which equity or public policy forbids as being prejudicial to another. In Black’s Legal Dictionary, ""fraud"" is defined as an intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to him or surrender a legal right; a false representation of a matter of fact whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment of that which should have been disclosed, which deceives and is intended to deceive another so that he shall act upon it to his legal injury. In Concise Oxford Dictionary, it has been defined as criminal deception, use of false representation to gain unjust advantage; dishonest artifice or trick. According to Halsbury’s Laws of England, a representation is deemed to have been false, and therefore a misrepresentation, if it was at the material date false in substance and in fact. Section 17 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines ""fraud"" as act committed by a party to a contract with intent to deceive another. From dictionary meaning or even otherwise fraud arises out of deliberate active role of representator about a fact, which he knows to be untrue yet he succeeds in misleading the representee by making him believe it to be true. The representation to become fraudulent must be of fact with knowledge that it was false. In a leading English case i.e. Derry and Ors. v. Peek (1886-90) All ER 1 what constitutes  Page 6 of 8 ""fraud"" was described thus: (All ER p. 22 B-C) ""fraud"" is proved when it is shown that a false representation has been made (i) knowingly, or (ii) without belief in its truth, or (iii) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false"". But ""fraud"" in public law is not the same as ""fraud"" in private law. Nor can the ingredients, which establish ""fraud"" in commercial transaction, be of assistance in determining fraud in Administrative Law. It has been aptly observed by Lord Bridge in Khawaja v. Secretary of State for Home Deptt. (1983) 1 All ER 765, that it is dangerous to introduce maxims of common law as to effect of fraud while determining fraud in relation of statutory law. ""Fraud"" in relation to statute must be a colourable transaction to evade the provisions of a statute. ""If a statute has been passed for some one particular purpose, a court of law will not countenance any attempt which may be made to extend the operation of the Act to something else which is quite foreign to its object and beyond its scope. Present day concept of fraud on statute has veered round abuse of power or mala fide exercise of power. It may arise due to overstepping the limits of power or defeating the provision of statute by adopting subterfuge or the power may be exercised for extraneous or irrelevant considerations. The colour of fraud in public law or administration law, as it is developing, is assuming different shades. It arises from a deception committed by disclosure of incorrect facts knowingly and deliberately to invoke exercise of power and procure an order from an authority or tribunal. It must result in exercise of jurisdiction which otherwise would not have been exercised. The misrepresentation must be in relation to the conditions provided in a section on existence or non-existence of which the power can be exercised. But non-disclosure of a fact not required by a statute to be disclosed may not amount to fraud. Even in commercial transactions non-disclosure of every fact does not vitiate the agreement. ""In a contract every person must look for himself and ensures that he acquires the information necessary to avoid bad bargain. In public law the duty is not to deceive. (See Shrisht Dhawan (Smt.) v. M/s. Shaw Brothers, (1992 (1) SCC 534). In that case it was observed as follows: ""Fraud and collusion vitiate even the most solemn proceedings in any civilized system of jurisprudence. It is a concept descriptive of human conduct. Michael levi likens a fraudster to Milton’s sorcerer, Comus, who exulted in his ability to, ’wing me into the easy-hearted man and trap him into snares’.

Peek [(1886-90) ALL ER Rep 1: (1889) 14 AC 337 (HL)] what constitutes fraud was described thus: (All Er p. 22 B-C) ’Fraud is proved when it is shown that a false representation has been made (i) knowingly, or (ii) without belief in its truth, or (iii) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false’."" This aspect of the matter has been considered recently by this Court in Roshan Deen v. Preeti Lal (2002 (1) SCC 100) Ram Preeti Yadav v. U.P. Board of High School and Intermediate Education (2003 (8) SCC 311), Ram Chandra Singh’s case (supra) and Ashok Leyland Ltd. v. State of T.N. and Another (2004 (3) SCC 1). Suppression of a material document would also amount to a fraud on the court. (see Gowrishankar v. Joshi Amba Shankar Family Trust (1996 (3) SCC 310) and S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu’s case (supra). ""Fraud"" is a conduct either by letter or words, which induces the other person or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to the conduct of the former either by words or letter. Although negligence is not fraud but it can be evidence on fraud; as observed in Ram Preeti Yadav’s case (supra). In Lazarus Estate Ltd. v. Beasley (1956) 1 QB 702, Lord Denning observed at pages 712 & 713, ""No judgment of a Court, no order of a Minister can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything."" In the same judgment Lord Parker LJ observed that fraud vitiates all transactions known to the law of however high a degree of solemnity. (page 722) These aspects were recently highlighted in the State of Andhra Pradesh and Anr. v. T. Suryachandr Rao (2005 (5) SCALE 621) To give finality to the controversy, we appoint Mr. Justice A.B. Palkar, a retired Judge of the Bombay High Court to examine the 354 cases. The relevant files shall be handed over to the Commission immediately. The Commission is requested to complete the verification within four months and submit its report to the State Government for necessary action. The claimants whose cases are to be examined shall be given opportunity to have their say before the Commission. The records of the Zilla Gaurav Samittee, High Power Committee and the Committee appointed by the High Court shall be examined by the Commission before issuing notice to he individual applicants to decide the acceptability or otherwise of the claims for freedom fighters’ pension. On getting report of the Commission, the State Government shall take necessary action. We make it clear that we have not expressed any  Page 8 of 8 opinion on the acceptability or otherwise of the claims as the Commission appointed by this Court shall examine those aspects. The Commission appointed by this Court shall be paid the same emoluments as are admissible to a sitting Judge of the High Court for the duration of its work, which we expect will be finished within a period of 4 months. The emoluments admissible to the Commission shall be paid by the State Government, apart from other expenses that may be incurred for functioning of the Commission. The appeals are allowed with no order as to costs."
5,Appeal (crl.) 948 of 2001,KULDIP SINGH AND ANOTHER,STATE OF PUNJAB,14/8/2002,N. SANTOSH HEGDE & BISHESHWAR PRASAD SINGH.,"Bisheshwar Prasad Singh, J. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh dated 13.02.2001 in Criminal Appeal No.439 (DB) of 1997, whereby the High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellants and confirmed the judgment and order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Ferozepur dated 29.4.1997 in Sessions Case No.76 of 1994, Sessions Trial No.43 of 1997 finding the appellants guilty of the offences under Section 302 and 201 IPC and sentencing them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life under Section 302 IPC and rigorous imprisonment for two years under Section 201 IPC. The appellants along with one Jasbir Singh were accused of having committed the murder of Kuldip Kaur, the wife of the informant, and Soni, the daughter of the informant. Since, it was found that Jasbir Singh was a juvenile, his case was separated for trial by the competent court. We are informed that he has since been acquitted. The appellants herein were acquitted by the trial court of the charge levelled against them for the murder of Soni, which order has been affirmed by the High Court. The informant, Sucha Singh is the elder brother of Kuldip Singh, appellant No.1. Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2 is the wife of the younger brother of the informant namely, Gurmit Singh. The victims were the wife and daughter of the informant. The FIR was lodged by Sucha Singh, PW-6 on 19.02.1994 at 8.15 p.m. In his report the informant stated that he was a resident of village Pirojwal Mangal Singh. He has three younger brothers namely, Gurmit Singh, husband of accused No.2, Surjit Singh and Kuldip Singh, appellant No.1. They all resided in the Dera constructed by them in their fields. Kuldip Singh, the youngest brother was unmarried. The informant was married twelve years ago to Kuldip Kaur (deceased) and they had four children, the eldest being a daughter, Soni aged about 9 years. The informant was employed as a Foreman at a Sheller at Moga. His younger brother, Gurmit Singh, husband of appellant No.2, was   of 7 also employed as a Foreman at a Sheller in Bhuche Mandi. About three years ago Gurmit Singh was married to Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2. Last year there were disputes between his wife, Kuldip Kaur (deceased) and the wife of Gurmit Singh, namely, appellant No.2, Bakshish Kaur. The disputes related to the partition of the house, clothes and jewellery etc.. Such disputes were a regular feature. On 02.01.1994, which was a Sunday, when the informant came home on the weekend he was told by his wife Kuldip Kaur (deceased) that there was again a quarrel with Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2 regarding distribution of jewellery etc.. Appellant No.2 had threatened her that she must leave this house or else she will finish her. On 03.01.1994, while going on duty the informant assured his wife that he will take premises on rent at Moga and shift his family. On 06.01.1994 Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2 came to his work place at Moga and informed him that his wife was missing since last night, and his daughter had died on account of electric shock. He immediately rushed to his Dera and found his daughter dead. The left hand of his daughter was charred, perhaps on account of electric shock. The informant was perplexed and disturbed and in that state of mind acceded to the advise given to him by the appellants to throw away the dead body of Soni in the Satluj river. On 07.01.1994, he appeared before Malkiat Singh, ASI, Incharge Chowki P.P. Kamalke and reported regarding his missing wife. He was ever since searching for his wife. On 19.01.1994, Resham Singh, PW-7, informed him that his wife who used to take milk from him regularly, did not come to take milk on 05.01.1994. He, therefore went to her house at about 7 p.m. There he heard raula (noise) and saw appellant No.2, Bakshish Kaur and her brother, Jasbir Singh catching hold of Kuldip Kaur by her legs while Gurmit Singh, appellant No.1 was strangulating her. Kuldip Kaur died, but out of fear this witness did not talk to anyone. On the basis of the information given to him by Resham Singh, the informant, was lodging the FIR complaining that Jasbir Singh had killed his wife as well as his daughter and had concealed the body of his wife. The FIR further records that the informant along with Resham Singh were going to the police station for registration of the case when they met the Station House Officer at Dharamkot bus stand, and the report was recorded there. The case was investigated by Surinder Pal, Sub Inspector, PW-12. After recording FIR, he searched for the accused on that day but he could not trace them out. On 20.02.1994 he again searched for them but they were not traceable. On 21.02.1994, Buta Singh, Sarpanch, PW-8, produced all the three accused before him and he interrogated them separately. He first interrogated Kuldip Singh whose voluntary statement was recorded (Ex. PN), thereafter he interrogated Jasbir Singh and Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2 whose voluntary statements were recorded which have been marked Ex. PO and Ex. PQ respectively. From the voluntary statements made by them it became known that the body of Kuldip Kaur had been concealed in the courtyard of Kuldip Kaur under a heap of Parali. He, therefore, sent a written request to the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Zira for permission to exhume the dead body of Kuldip Kaur. The medical officer was similarly requested for post mortem examination of the dead body. Shri Inder Dev Singh, Naib Tehsildar was deputed to supervise the proceeding, Dr. Rachhpal Singh Sandhu, medical officer had also come to the place of occurrence. In the presence of all these persons the dead body of Kuldip Kaur was exhumed and memo Ex. PK was prepared which was attested by the informant, Sucha Singh, Inder Dev Singh, Naib Tehsildar, the Medical Officer, Dr.  Page 3 of 7 Rachhpal Singh and Sukhvinder Singh, PW-10. The case of the prosecution is that the three accused had come to the house of Buta Singh, PW-8 on 21.02.1994 and had told him that the police was searching for them and that he should help them since he had considerable influence with the police. They had confessed before him that they had committed the murder of Kuldip Kaur. The prosecution, therefore, in support of its case pressed into service the extra judicial confessions said to have been made by the accused before Buta Singh, PW-8. Apart from Resham Singh, PW-7, who claimed to be an eye witness, the case of the prosecution rests on circumstantial evidence. The circumstances on which the prosecution relied are two, namely, confessions made by the appellants before the Sarpanch, Buta Singh, PW-8, and voluntary statements made by the accused before the Investigating Officer resulting in the discovery of the dead body of Kuldip Kaur. Since Resham Singh resiled from his statement made in the course of investigation and categorically stated that he had not seen anybody committing the murder of Kuldip Kaur, and reported nothing to anyone, the courts below have rightly held that his evidence is of no help to the prosecution. The courts below have recorded finding of guilt, on the basis of these two circumstances. It was contended before us on behalf of the appellants that the courts below have erred in relying upon these two circumstances which were not even established by cogent evidence on record. The evidence adduced by the prosecution was contradictory and created a grave doubt about the truthfulness of the prosecution case. He submitted that the very first requirement in cases that rested on circumstantial evidence, namely that the incriminating circumstances in the first instance must be established by cogent and reliable evidence, was not fulfilled. Having regard to the submission urged before us we now proceed to examine the relevant evidence on record. We shall first examine the evidence of PW-7 who, as stated earlier, was declared hostile to the prosecution. He has stated that he knew the family of the appellants who were having their residence in their fields. He also admitted that Kuldip Kaur, wife of Sucha Singh used to collect milk from his house and that Kuldip Kaur (deceased) and Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2 used to frequently quarrel. He, thereafter, went on to state that on 05.01.1994, he had gone to Moga to recite Akhand Path, and in his absence Kuldip Kaur (deceased) had collected milk from his house. On the next day he heard that the daughter of Sucha Singh namely, Soni had died on account of electric shock. He had, therefore, gone to the house of Sucha Singh for condolence. He categorically stated that he had not seen anyone committing the murder of Kuldip Kaur. From the cross examination of this witness, it appears that in the course of investigation his statement was recorded under Section 161 Cr. P.C. wherein he had stated that on 05.01.1994, Kuldip Kaur as usual had not come to collect milk and after waiting he had gone to the Dera of Sucha Singh at about 7 p.m. and had witnessed the murder of Kuldip Kaur from a distance. He had seen that in the room of Gurmit Singh, Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2 and Jasbir Singh, her brother, had caught hold of Kuldip Kaur from her legs while Kuldip Singh strangulated Kuldip Kaur to death. He had not narrated this incident to anyone out of fear. He denied having narrated this incident to Sucha Singh. He even denied having accompanied Sucha Singh to the police station and that on 19.02.1994 the FIR was recorded in his presence. He  Page 4 of 7 was confronted with his statement under Section 161 Cr. P.C. but he denied having made any such statement. In our view the courts below have rightly held that the evidence of Resham Singh is of no help to the prosecution. We are then left with the evidence led by the prosecution to establish the two circumstances on which the case of the prosecution rests. We shall first consider the evidence relating to the confession said to have been made by the appellants before the Sarpanch, Buta Singh, PW-8. PW-8 deposed that on 21.02.1994, all the three accused came to his house and told him that they were being chased by the police and have therefore come to him since he had influence with the police. They confessed before him that they had committed the murder of Kuldip Kaur and Soni as there used to be frequent quarrels between Kuldip Kaur and Bakshish Kaur. According to PW-8, nothing else was told to him. Leaving all the three accused in his house he proceeded to the city but met Surinder Pal, SHO, PW-12 on the canal. He informed him that all the three accused were with him and he wanted to produce them before him. PW-12 asked him as to when he would produce the accused and he told him that if they could stay there for some time he will produce them immediately. Thereafter, he went to his village, brought all the accused with him and produced them before PW-12. His statement was recorded by the police. He denied to have told the police that he had told the accused persons who had confessed before him that they should come after a day or so and that in the meantime he would talk to the officers concerned, and that the accused had left his house. He also denied to have stated in his statement under Section 161 Cr. P.C. that on 05.01.1994, Jasbir Singh had met his sister Bakshish Kaur and they along with Kuldip Singh had conspired to eliminate Kuldip Kaur. He also denied having stated that Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2, had invited Kuldip Kaur to her house and when Kuldip Kaur came to her room she was strangulated by Kuldip Singh, while Bakshish Kaur and Jasbir Singh caught hold of her by her legs. He also denied having told the police that after some time Soni, daughter of Kuldip Kaur aged about 9 years came to the house of Bakshish Kaur and on seeing her mother dead she started weeping. The accused apprehending that she may disclose their secret electrocuted her with live electric wire. It will thus appear that the version given by this witness before the Court is quite different from the version in his statement under Section 161 Cr. P.C. This witness cannot be said to be reliable, and therefore, one has to critically scrutinize his evidence before acceptance. As regards the production of the accused before the police, he stated that the accused were not interrogated in his presence, neither was his signature obtained by the police on any paper regarding production of the accused. He categorically asserted that he had produced the accused on 21.02.1994 and his statement was recorded on that day. His statement was not recorded by the police on 20.02.1994. This witness asserted that in the statement made by him in the course of investigation he had told the police that all the three accused were in his house and further told PW-12 that he would produce them before him where upon PW-12 asked him as to when they would be produced and he replied by saying that he could produce them right away. He was confronted with the statement recorded under Section 161 Cr. P.C. where it was not so recorded. From the evidence of Buta Singh, PW-8, it is evident that the accused confessed before him on 21.02.1994 and on that very day he produced them before the police when his statement was also recorded. He categorically denied the fact that his statement was recorded on 20.02.1994.  Page 5 of 7 On the other hand, we have the evidence of PW-12, the Investigating Officer. He has stated that he had searched for the accused on 19.02.1994 but they could not be traced. On 20.02.1994 also he searched for them but they could not be found. On that day Sarpanch of the village came to the place of occurrence and gave a statement before him under Section 161 Cr. P.C. On the following day, i.e. 21.02.1994, when he along with other police officials was present on the bridge of the canal, the Sarpanch, namely, Buta Singh produced the three accused before him. It would thus appear that according to the Investigating Officer the statement of Buta Singh was recorded on 20.02.1994. On the following day, he produced the accused before him. There is obvious inconsistency in the testimony of these two witnesses. The case of the prosecution as put forth before the Court is that the accused were produced by Buta Singh, PW-8 before the Investigating Officer, PW-12 on 21.02.1994. The question is as to when the accused confessed their guilt before Buta Singh, PW-8. If Buta Singh is to be believed, the accused confessed their guilt before him on the same day on which he produced them before the police. According to him, the accused were waiting in his house while he went to meet the police officer. He categorically denies having made any earlier statement before the police on 20.02.1994. On the other hand, according to the Investigating Officer, PW-12, Buta Singh had made statement before him on 20.02.1994 and had thereafter produced the accused before him on 21.02.1994. The evidence of these two witnesses gives rise to a lot of uncertainty as to whether the confessions were made on 20.02.1994 or on 21.02.1994 and also whether the accused were taken into custody on 20th or 21st February, 1994. If it is believed that Buta Singh had produced the accused before the police on the same date on which he made a statement before the Investigating Officer, then it must follow that the accused were taken into custody on 20.02.1994. If the confessions were made by them on 21.02.1994 while in custody, they will be inadmissible in evidence. At the same time there is considerable doubt as to whether the confessions were made before Buta Singh on 20.02.1994. As it is, an extra judicial confession, is considered to be a weak type of evidence. In the instant case such extra judicial confession is said to have been made before a witness who stands thoroughly discredited in his cross examination. He has resiled from the version disclosed by him in the course of investigation and recorded under Section 161 Cr. P.C. His evidence does not inspire confidence. In addition, his evidence read together with the evidence of PW-12 creates considerable doubt as to whether the accused confessed their guilt before Buta Singh, PW-8 on 20.02.1994 or 21.02.1994. Counsel for the appellants drew our attention to Ex. PC, which was the requisition sent by the Investigating Officer to the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Zira requesting him to get the body exhumed. His letter states that the accused had admitted having committed the murder of Kuldip Kaur. The Investigating Officer in the course of his cross examination has admitted that the date written on the said requisition was 20.02.1994 but the same has been struck off and in its place the date 21.02.1994 has been written. In normal course we would not attach much significance to such correction being made, but having regard to the evidence on record this correction of the date on Ex. PC acquires significance. Having regard to the evidence on record, we are satisfied that the evidence adduced by the prosecution to establish the fact that the appellants had confessed before Buta Singh on 21.02.1994 is inconsistent and does not inspire confidence. The prosecution, therefore, has failed to establish the first circumstance in the circumstantial chain. The second incriminating circumstance relied upon by the  Page 6 of 7 prosecution is that after the accused were produced before the Investigating Officer, PW-12, they were interrogated separately and in the course of interrogation they made voluntary statements leading to the discovery of the dead body of Kuldip Kaur. Accordingly, the body was exhumed and post mortem examination conducted over the dead body of the deceased which was identified to be that of Kuldip Kaur. According to PW-12, after the accused were produced before him by Buta Singh, Sarpanch, PW-8, he first interrogated Kuldip Singh who made a disclosure statement that he along with Bakshish Kaur and Jasbir Singh had kept concealed the dead body of Kuldip Kaur under a heap of Parali lying in the courtyard of the house of Kuldip Kaur which he only knew and could get the same recovered. The disclosure statement was reduced into writing and the same was proved by him and marked as Ex. PN which is signed by appellant Kuldip Singh and attested by ASI, Niranjan Singh and Head Constable Chamkaur Singh. Thereafter he interrogated Jasbir Singh who made similar statement which was recorded and exhibited as Ex. PO. Lastly, he interrogated Bakshish Kaur, who also made an identical statement. Her disclosure statement was exhibited as Ex. PQ. Exhibits PN, PO and PQ, the three disclosure statements have been recorded by the Investigating Officer, PW-12. We have perused the disclosure statements and we find that the Investigating Officer has made an obvious mistake while stating that the accused had stated that the body was kept concealed under the heap of Parali in the Dera of Kuldip Kaur. In fact the disclosure statements are to the effect that the body has been kept concealed in the Dera of Gurmit Singh, husband of Bakshish Kaur. Pursuant to the disclosure statements the Investigating Officer, as earlier noticed, sought directions of the SDM to exhume the dead body and also requested the medical officer to perform the post mortem examination. The prosecution led evidence to prove that the body was exhumed and the same was identified as that of Kuldip Kaur. The prosecution evidence is consistent that the body was exhumed from the courtyard of Sucha Singh. PW-10, Sukhvinder Singh, brother of deceased Kuldip Kaur, PW-12, the Investigating Officer and other witnesses have said so. What is surprising is the fact that Sucha Singh himself has not said a word about the discovery of the body. In fact, in his deposition, he has not stated anything about what happened after he lodged the FIR, though it appears from the evidence of PW-10 that Sucha Singh, PW.6, had also signed the inquest report as well the memo prepared regarding taking possession of the dead body of Kuldip Kaur. However, it is not necessary to dilate on this aspect of the matter. It is obvious from the facts brought on record that according to the disclosure statements made by the accused the dead body was lying buried in the courtyard of Gurmit Singh, husband of Bakshish Kaur. On the other hand, the evidence is equally clear that the dead body was actually recovered from the courtyard of Sucha Singh, husband of Kuldip Kaur. It cannot therefore be said that the dead body of Kuldip Kaur was recovered pursuant to the disclosure statements made by the accused. There is also no scope for any confusion because the accused being members of the same family could make no mistake about the courtyard of one or the other. Moreover, Sucha Singh, PW-6, in his deposition has clearly stated that he had constructed his house with a boundary wall and his brothers also had separate houses with boundary walls. The courtyards of all the three brothers were therefore clearly demarcated and therefore the recovery cannot be explained by  Page 7 of 7 conjecturing that though they mentioned the courtyard of Gurmit Singh actually they meant the courtyard of Sucha Singh. We may only notice at this stage that Buta Singh in the course of investigation had informed the Investigating Officer that Bakshish Kaur had invited Kuldip Kaur to her house and she has been killed there. Similarly, Resham Singh, PW-7, in the course of investigation claimed to have seen the murder being committed in the house of Gurmit Singh. We have referred to the statement made by these witnesses in the course of investigation only to recapitulate the background in which the disclosure statements were recorded. But as a matter of fact the body was found buried in the courtyard of Sucha Singh and not the courtyard of Gurmit Singh. Under these circumstances, it is not possible to hold that the dead body of Kuldip Kaur was recovered pursuant to the alleged disclosure statements made by the appellants herein. The prosecution has therefore failed to establish the second incriminating circumstance as well. In view of our finding that the evidence regarding confessions made by the appellants and recovery of dead body pursuant to the disclosure statements made by them is unbelievable and unacceptable, there is no other evidence on record on the basis on which the conviction of the appellants can be upheld. We, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 13.02.2001 and acquit the appellants of the charges levelled against them. Appellant No.2 is on bail. Her bail bonds are discharged. Appellant No.1 shall be released forthwith unless required in connection with any other matter","Bisheshwar Prasad Singh, J. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh dated 13.02.2001 in Criminal Appeal No.439 (DB) of 1997, whereby the High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellants and confirmed the judgment and order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Ferozepur dated 29.4.1997 in Sessions Case No.76 of 1994, Sessions Trial No.43 of 1997 finding the appellants guilty of the offences under Section 302 and 201 IPC and sentencing them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life under Section 302 IPC and rigorous imprisonment for two years under Section 201 IPC. The appellants along with one Jasbir Singh were accused of having committed the murder of Kuldip Kaur, the wife of the informant, and Soni, the daughter of the informant. Since, it was found that Jasbir Singh was a juvenile, his case was separated for trial by the competent court. We are informed that he has since been acquitted. The appellants herein were acquitted by the trial court of the charge levelled against them for the murder of Soni, which order has been affirmed by the High Court. The informant, Sucha Singh is the elder brother of Kuldip Singh, appellant No.1. Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2 is the wife of the younger brother of the informant namely, Gurmit Singh. The victims were the wife and daughter of the informant. The FIR was lodged by Sucha Singh, PW-6 on 19.02.1994 at 8.15 p.m. In his report the informant stated that he was a resident of village Pirojwal Mangal Singh. He has three younger brothers namely, Gurmit Singh, husband of accused No.2, Surjit Singh and Kuldip Singh, appellant No.1. They all resided in the Dera constructed by them in their fields. Kuldip Singh, the youngest brother was unmarried. The informant was married twelve years ago to Kuldip Kaur (deceased) and they had four children, the eldest being a daughter, Soni aged about 9 years. The informant was employed as a Foreman at a Sheller at Moga. His younger brother, Gurmit Singh, husband of appellant No.2, was   of 7 also employed as a Foreman at a Sheller in Bhuche Mandi. About three years ago Gurmit Singh was married to Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2. Last year there were disputes between his wife, Kuldip Kaur (deceased) and the wife of Gurmit Singh, namely, appellant No.2, Bakshish Kaur. The disputes related to the partition of the house, clothes and jewellery etc.. Such disputes were a regular feature. On 02.01.1994, which was a Sunday, when the informant came home on the weekend he was told by his wife Kuldip Kaur (deceased) that there was again a quarrel with Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2 regarding distribution of jewellery etc.. Appellant No.2 had threatened her that she must leave this house or else she will finish her. On 03.01.1994, while going on duty the informant assured his wife that he will take premises on rent at Moga and shift his family. On 06.01.1994 Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2 came to his work place at Moga and informed him that his wife was missing since last night, and his daughter had died on account of electric shock. He immediately rushed to his Dera and found his daughter dead. The left hand of his daughter was charred, perhaps on account of electric shock. The informant was perplexed and disturbed and in that state of mind acceded to the advise given to him by the appellants to throw away the dead body of Soni in the Satluj river. On 07.01.1994, he appeared before Malkiat Singh, ASI, Incharge Chowki P.P. Kamalke and reported regarding his missing wife. He was ever since searching for his wife. On 19.01.1994, Resham Singh, PW-7, informed him that his wife who used to take milk from him regularly, did not come to take milk on 05.01.1994. He, therefore went to her house at about 7 p.m. There he heard raula (noise) and saw appellant No.2, Bakshish Kaur and her brother, Jasbir Singh catching hold of Kuldip Kaur by her legs while Gurmit Singh, appellant No.1 was strangulating her. Kuldip Kaur died, but out of fear this witness did not talk to anyone. On the basis of the information given to him by Resham Singh, the informant, was lodging the FIR complaining that Jasbir Singh had killed his wife as well as his daughter and had concealed the body of his wife. The FIR further records that the informant along with Resham Singh were going to the police station for registration of the case when they met the Station House Officer at Dharamkot bus stand, and the report was recorded there. The case was investigated by Surinder Pal, Sub Inspector, PW-12. After recording FIR, he searched for the accused on that day but he could not trace them out. On 20.02.1994 he again searched for them but they were not traceable. On 21.02.1994, Buta Singh, Sarpanch, PW-8, produced all the three accused before him and he interrogated them separately. He first interrogated Kuldip Singh whose voluntary statement was recorded (Ex. PN), thereafter he interrogated Jasbir Singh and Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2 whose voluntary statements were recorded which have been marked Ex. PO and Ex. PQ respectively. From the voluntary statements made by them it became known that the body of Kuldip Kaur had been concealed in the courtyard of Kuldip Kaur under a heap of Parali. He, therefore, sent a written request to the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Zira for permission to exhume the dead body of Kuldip Kaur. The medical officer was similarly requested for post mortem examination of the dead body. Shri Inder Dev Singh, Naib Tehsildar was deputed to supervise the proceeding, Dr. Rachhpal Singh Sandhu, medical officer had also come to the place of occurrence. In the presence of all these persons the dead body of Kuldip Kaur was exhumed and memo Ex. PK was prepared which was attested by the informant, Sucha Singh, Inder Dev Singh, Naib Tehsildar, the Medical Officer, Dr.  Page 3 of 7 Rachhpal Singh and Sukhvinder Singh, PW-10. The case of the prosecution is that the three accused had come to the house of Buta Singh, PW-8 on 21.02.1994 and had told him that the police was searching for them and that he should help them since he had considerable influence with the police. They had confessed before him that they had committed the murder of Kuldip Kaur. The prosecution, therefore, in support of its case pressed into service the extra judicial confessions said to have been made by the accused before Buta Singh, PW-8. Apart from Resham Singh, PW-7, who claimed to be an eye witness, the case of the prosecution rests on circumstantial evidence. The circumstances on which the prosecution relied are two, namely, confessions made by the appellants before the Sarpanch, Buta Singh, PW-8, and voluntary statements made by the accused before the Investigating Officer resulting in the discovery of the dead body of Kuldip Kaur. Since Resham Singh resiled from his statement made in the course of investigation and categorically stated that he had not seen anybody committing the murder of Kuldip Kaur, and reported nothing to anyone, the courts below have rightly held that his evidence is of no help to the prosecution. The courts below have recorded finding of guilt, on the basis of these two circumstances. It was contended before us on behalf of the appellants that the courts below have erred in relying upon these two circumstances which were not even established by cogent evidence on record. The evidence adduced by the prosecution was contradictory and created a grave doubt about the truthfulness of the prosecution case. He submitted that the very first requirement in cases that rested on circumstantial evidence, namely that the incriminating circumstances in the first instance must be established by cogent and reliable evidence, was not fulfilled. Having regard to the submission urged before us we now proceed to examine the relevant evidence on record. We shall first examine the evidence of PW-7 who, as stated earlier, was declared hostile to the prosecution. He has stated that he knew the family of the appellants who were having their residence in their fields. He also admitted that Kuldip Kaur, wife of Sucha Singh used to collect milk from his house and that Kuldip Kaur (deceased) and Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2 used to frequently quarrel. He, thereafter, went on to state that on 05.01.1994, he had gone to Moga to recite Akhand Path, and in his absence Kuldip Kaur (deceased) had collected milk from his house. On the next day he heard that the daughter of Sucha Singh namely, Soni had died on account of electric shock. He had, therefore, gone to the house of Sucha Singh for condolence. He categorically stated that he had not seen anyone committing the murder of Kuldip Kaur. From the cross examination of this witness, it appears that in the course of investigation his statement was recorded under Section 161 Cr. P.C. wherein he had stated that on 05.01.1994, Kuldip Kaur as usual had not come to collect milk and after waiting he had gone to the Dera of Sucha Singh at about 7 p.m. and had witnessed the murder of Kuldip Kaur from a distance. He had seen that in the room of Gurmit Singh, Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2 and Jasbir Singh, her brother, had caught hold of Kuldip Kaur from her legs while Kuldip Singh strangulated Kuldip Kaur to death. He had not narrated this incident to anyone out of fear. He denied having narrated this incident to Sucha Singh. He even denied having accompanied Sucha Singh to the police station and that on 19.02.1994 the FIR was recorded in his presence. He  Page 4 of 7 was confronted with his statement under Section 161 Cr. P.C. but he denied having made any such statement. In our view the courts below have rightly held that the evidence of Resham Singh is of no help to the prosecution. We are then left with the evidence led by the prosecution to establish the two circumstances on which the case of the prosecution rests. We shall first consider the evidence relating to the confession said to have been made by the appellants before the Sarpanch, Buta Singh, PW-8. PW-8 deposed that on 21.02.1994, all the three accused came to his house and told him that they were being chased by the police and have therefore come to him since he had influence with the police. They confessed before him that they had committed the murder of Kuldip Kaur and Soni as there used to be frequent quarrels between Kuldip Kaur and Bakshish Kaur. According to PW-8, nothing else was told to him. Leaving all the three accused in his house he proceeded to the city but met Surinder Pal, SHO, PW-12 on the canal. He informed him that all the three accused were with him and he wanted to produce them before him. PW-12 asked him as to when he would produce the accused and he told him that if they could stay there for some time he will produce them immediately. Thereafter, he went to his village, brought all the accused with him and produced them before PW-12. His statement was recorded by the police. He denied to have told the police that he had told the accused persons who had confessed before him that they should come after a day or so and that in the meantime he would talk to the officers concerned, and that the accused had left his house. He also denied to have stated in his statement under Section 161 Cr. P.C. that on 05.01.1994, Jasbir Singh had met his sister Bakshish Kaur and they along with Kuldip Singh had conspired to eliminate Kuldip Kaur. He also denied having stated that Bakshish Kaur, appellant No.2, had invited Kuldip Kaur to her house and when Kuldip Kaur came to her room she was strangulated by Kuldip Singh, while Bakshish Kaur and Jasbir Singh caught hold of her by her legs. He also denied having told the police that after some time Soni, daughter of Kuldip Kaur aged about 9 years came to the house of Bakshish Kaur and on seeing her mother dead she started weeping. The accused apprehending that she may disclose their secret electrocuted her with live electric wire. It will thus appear that the version given by this witness before the Court is quite different from the version in his statement under Section 161 Cr. P.C. This witness cannot be said to be reliable, and therefore, one has to critically scrutinize his evidence before acceptance. As regards the production of the accused before the police, he stated that the accused were not interrogated in his presence, neither was his signature obtained by the police on any paper regarding production of the accused. He categorically asserted that he had produced the accused on 21.02.1994 and his statement was recorded on that day. His statement was not recorded by the police on 20.02.1994. This witness asserted that in the statement made by him in the course of investigation he had told the police that all the three accused were in his house and further told PW-12 that he would produce them before him where upon PW-12 asked him as to when they would be produced and he replied by saying that he could produce them right away. He was confronted with the statement recorded under Section 161 Cr. P.C. where it was not so recorded. From the evidence of Buta Singh, PW-8, it is evident that the accused confessed before him on 21.02.1994 and on that very day he produced them before the police when his statement was also recorded. He categorically denied the fact that his statement was recorded on 20.02.1994.  Page 5 of 7 On the other hand, we have the evidence of PW-12, the Investigating Officer. He has stated that he had searched for the accused on 19.02.1994 but they could not be traced. On 20.02.1994 also he searched for them but they could not be found. On that day Sarpanch of the village came to the place of occurrence and gave a statement before him under Section 161 Cr. P.C. On the following day, i.e. 21.02.1994, when he along with other police officials was present on the bridge of the canal, the Sarpanch, namely, Buta Singh produced the three accused before him. It would thus appear that according to the Investigating Officer the statement of Buta Singh was recorded on 20.02.1994. On the following day, he produced the accused before him. There is obvious inconsistency in the testimony of these two witnesses. The case of the prosecution as put forth before the Court is that the accused were produced by Buta Singh, PW-8 before the Investigating Officer, PW-12 on 21.02.1994. The question is as to when the accused confessed their guilt before Buta Singh, PW-8. If Buta Singh is to be believed, the accused confessed their guilt before him on the same day on which he produced them before the police. According to him, the accused were waiting in his house while he went to meet the police officer. He categorically denies having made any earlier statement before the police on 20.02.1994. On the other hand, according to the Investigating Officer, PW-12, Buta Singh had made statement before him on 20.02.1994 and had thereafter produced the accused before him on 21.02.1994. The evidence of these two witnesses gives rise to a lot of uncertainty as to whether the confessions were made on 20.02.1994 or on 21.02.1994 and also whether the accused were taken into custody on 20th or 21st February, 1994. If it is believed that Buta Singh had produced the accused before the police on the same date on which he made a statement before the Investigating Officer, then it must follow that the accused were taken into custody on 20.02.1994. If the confessions were made by them on 21.02.1994 while in custody, they will be inadmissible in evidence. At the same time there is considerable doubt as to whether the confessions were made before Buta Singh on 20.02.1994. As it is, an extra judicial confession, is considered to be a weak type of evidence. In the instant case such extra judicial confession is said to have been made before a witness who stands thoroughly discredited in his cross examination. He has resiled from the version disclosed by him in the course of investigation and recorded under Section 161 Cr. P.C. His evidence does not inspire confidence. In addition, his evidence read together with the evidence of PW-12 creates considerable doubt as to whether the accused confessed their guilt before Buta Singh, PW-8 on 20.02.1994 or 21.02.1994. Counsel for the appellants drew our attention to Ex. PC, which was the requisition sent by the Investigating Officer to the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Zira requesting him to get the body exhumed. His letter states that the accused had admitted having committed the murder of Kuldip Kaur. The Investigating Officer in the course of his cross examination has admitted that the date written on the said requisition was 20.02.1994 but the same has been struck off and in its place the date 21.02.1994 has been written. In normal course we would not attach much significance to such correction being made, but having regard to the evidence on record this correction of the date on Ex. PC acquires significance. Having regard to the evidence on record, we are satisfied that the evidence adduced by the prosecution to establish the fact that the appellants had confessed before Buta Singh on 21.02.1994 is inconsistent and does not inspire confidence. The prosecution, therefore, has failed to establish the first circumstance in the circumstantial chain. The second incriminating circumstance relied upon by the  Page 6 of 7 prosecution is that after the accused were produced before the Investigating Officer, PW-12, they were interrogated separately and in the course of interrogation they made voluntary statements leading to the discovery of the dead body of Kuldip Kaur. Accordingly, the body was exhumed and post mortem examination conducted over the dead body of the deceased which was identified to be that of Kuldip Kaur. According to PW-12, after the accused were produced before him by Buta Singh, Sarpanch, PW-8, he first interrogated Kuldip Singh who made a disclosure statement that he along with Bakshish Kaur and Jasbir Singh had kept concealed the dead body of Kuldip Kaur under a heap of Parali lying in the courtyard of the house of Kuldip Kaur which he only knew and could get the same recovered. The disclosure statement was reduced into writing and the same was proved by him and marked as Ex. PN which is signed by appellant Kuldip Singh and attested by ASI, Niranjan Singh and Head Constable Chamkaur Singh. Thereafter he interrogated Jasbir Singh who made similar statement which was recorded and exhibited as Ex. PO. Lastly, he interrogated Bakshish Kaur, who also made an identical statement. Her disclosure statement was exhibited as Ex. PQ. Exhibits PN, PO and PQ, the three disclosure statements have been recorded by the Investigating Officer, PW-12. We have perused the disclosure statements and we find that the Investigating Officer has made an obvious mistake while stating that the accused had stated that the body was kept concealed under the heap of Parali in the Dera of Kuldip Kaur. In fact the disclosure statements are to the effect that the body has been kept concealed in the Dera of Gurmit Singh, husband of Bakshish Kaur. Pursuant to the disclosure statements the Investigating Officer, as earlier noticed, sought directions of the SDM to exhume the dead body and also requested the medical officer to perform the post mortem examination. The prosecution led evidence to prove that the body was exhumed and the same was identified as that of Kuldip Kaur. The prosecution evidence is consistent that the body was exhumed from the courtyard of Sucha Singh. PW-10, Sukhvinder Singh, brother of deceased Kuldip Kaur, PW-12, the Investigating Officer and other witnesses have said so. What is surprising is the fact that Sucha Singh himself has not said a word about the discovery of the body. In fact, in his deposition, he has not stated anything about what happened after he lodged the FIR, though it appears from the evidence of PW-10 that Sucha Singh, PW.6, had also signed the inquest report as well the memo prepared regarding taking possession of the dead body of Kuldip Kaur.

It cannot therefore be said that the dead body of Kuldip Kaur was recovered pursuant to the disclosure statements made by the accused. There is also no scope for any confusion because the accused being members of the same family could make no mistake about the courtyard of one or the other. Moreover, Sucha Singh, PW-6, in his deposition has clearly stated that he had constructed his house with a boundary wall and his brothers also had separate houses with boundary walls. The courtyards of all the three brothers were therefore clearly demarcated and therefore the recovery cannot be explained by  Page 7 of 7 conjecturing that though they mentioned the courtyard of Gurmit Singh actually they meant the courtyard of Sucha Singh. We may only notice at this stage that Buta Singh in the course of investigation had informed the Investigating Officer that Bakshish Kaur had invited Kuldip Kaur to her house and she has been killed there. Similarly, Resham Singh, PW-7, in the course of investigation claimed to have seen the murder being committed in the house of Gurmit Singh. We have referred to the statement made by these witnesses in the course of investigation only to recapitulate the background in which the disclosure statements were recorded. But as a matter of fact the body was found buried in the courtyard of Sucha Singh and not the courtyard of Gurmit Singh. Under these circumstances, it is not possible to hold that the dead body of Kuldip Kaur was recovered pursuant to the alleged disclosure statements made by the appellants herein.

In view of our finding that the evidence regarding confessions made by the appellants and recovery of dead body pursuant to the disclosure statements made by them is unbelievable and unacceptable, there is no other evidence on record on the basis on which the conviction of the appellants can be upheld. We, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 13.02.2001 and acquit the appellants of the charges levelled against them. Appellant No.2 is on bail. Her bail bonds are discharged. Appellant No.1 shall be released forthwith unless required in connection with any other matter"
6,Appeal (civil) 4105 of 1999,MAKHAN LAL BANGAL,MANAS BHUNIA & ORS.,3/1/2000,"R.C.Lahoti, S.V.Patil","R.C. Lahoti, J. L.....I.........T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J This appeal under Section 116-A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (hereinafter the RPA, for short) has been preferred by a candidate who won at the election but has lost in the election petition. Elections for the legislative seat of No.216, Sabang Legislative Assembly Constituency in the district of Midnapore, West Bengal were held in May, 1996. There were four candidates in the fray. The appellant secured 60453 votes. The respondent no.1 secured 59628 votes. The other two candidates received 594 and 453 votes respectively. On 12.5.1996 the appellant was declared elected by a margin of 825 votes over his nearest rival, the respondent no.1. On 17.6.1996, the respondent no.1 filed an election petition laying challenge to the election of the appellant and seeking a declaration that the result of the election was void. A declaration that the respondent no.1 was duly elected was also sought for. On trial the High Court has allowed the election petition and set aside the election of the appellant declaring the same to be void. No other direction has been made. The appellant and two other candidates who had contested the election were only arrayed as the respondents in the election petition filed before the High Court. It is not necessary to set out the pleadings, evidence and other details of the case in view of our having formed an opinion that the judgment under appeal suffers from a serious lacuna going to the root of the matter and therefore deserves to be set aside followed by a remand to the High Court with a direction to comply with the provisions of Section 99 of the RPA and thereafter decide the election petition afresh. The facts insofar as necessary to demonstrate the need for remand are stated in brief hereinafter. The principal ground on which the election of the   of 11 appellant was sought to be set aside was that the result of the election, insofar as it concerns the returned candidate was materially affected by corrupt practices committed in the interests of the returned candidate by the agents other than his election agent within the meaning of Section 100 (1)(d) (ii) of the RPA. The election petition alleged commission of corrupt practices as defined in sub-sections (2) (4) and (7) of Section 123 of the the RPA. For the purpose of this appeal it would suffice to note the issues framed by the High Court, the answers given and the findings recorded by the High Court. Issues (1) Is the election petition maintainable in the present form? (2) Is the respondent no.1, his election agent and/or his election agents is/are guilty of corrupt practices as alleged in paragraph 11 and sub-paragraphs thereunder of the election petition? (3) Is the respondent no.1, his election agents, the Returning Officer, Assistant Returning Officer, counting Supervisors, counting Assistants acting as agent of the respondent no.1 resorted to corrupt practices as alleged in paragraph 27 and sub-paragraphs thereunder under of the said election petition? (4) Is the election petitioner entitled to a declaration that the election of the respondent no.1 from the said 216, Sabang Legislative Assembly Constituency void? (5) Was the Returning Officer of the said Assembly Constituency biased in favour of the respondent no.1? (6) Is the election petitioner entitled to a declaration that the petitioner has been duly elected to the said constituency having received majority of valid votes? (7) Is the election petitioner entitled to recounting of votes under the supervision of this court as prayed for in the petition? (8) What relief, if any, the election petitioner is entitled to? Findings : Issues settled are answered in the manner following Issue No.1 - The election petition is maintainable. Issue No.2 - The respondent no.1, election agent and agents are guilty of corrupt practices. Issue No.3 - The respondent no.1, the Returning Officer, the Assistant Returning Officer, the Counting Supervisor, Counting Assistant acting as agent of the respondent no.1 and resorted to corrupt practices. I am not, however, inclined to declare the petitioner as elected or secured majority of votes. There is no question of recounting in the instant case inasmuch as the  Page 3 of 11 election is vitiated by corrupt practices since the election is declared void. So far Issue Nos.2 and 3 are concerned, they are decided in the affirmative. I am of the view that the petitioner cannot be declared as elected. For all the aforesaid reasons, in my view, it is proved that corrupt practices had been committed under Sections 123(2), 123(4) and 123(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by the returned candidate and/or his agents and the election of 216 Sabang Legislative Assembly constituency declaring the respondent no.1 should be declared void. (Sic.) Considering all aspects of the matter I am of the view that corrupt practice under Sections 123(2), 123(4) and 123(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by the respondent no.1 and/or his agents has been proved in this case. Accordingly it is declared that the election of the respondent no.1 being the returned candidate from 216-Sabang Legislative Assembly Constituency is void. In addition to the findings arrived at (extracted and reproduced as hereinabove from the operative part of the judgment of the High Court), a few other findings from the body of the judgment, not all but only a few by way of illustration, are extracted and reproduced, so as to demonstrate how, in the light of its own findings, the High Court has failed in discharging its statutory obligation cast by Section 99 of the the RPA resulting in vitiating the judgment. Those findings are: . . . . . . . . . it can be safely concluded from a careful reading of the written statement that (a) Hem Bhattacharya, Dipak Sarkar, Debasis Bose, Nilanjan Chatterjee, Returning Officer, Anindya Kar, Block Development Officer and Assistant Returning Officer, Kushal Mitra, Officer-in-Charge of Sabang Police Station, Pradip Das, Joint BDO, Sabang, Hare Krishna Jana, Sabhapati, Sabang Panchayat Samity; Chitta Bera, election agent of respondent no.1 and Basudeb Bag. Addl. S.P. Burdwan, all acted as agents of respondent no.1 being the part of the election machinery of CPI(M). It is further proved by admission that the political machinery of CPI(M) actively engaged itself not only to propagate for the respondent no.1 but also ensured win of the respondent no.1 by commission of several corrupt practices mentioned in the petition as agent of respondent no.1. xxx xxx xxx xxx It is clearly established from his evidence and also from several exhibits that the machinery of the CPI(M) its nemerous workers, cadres activists and supporters were all working for respondent no.1 as his agents and that the said corrupt practices committed by CPI(M) workers and leaders are no more than the works of the agents of respondent no.1 and for each such corrupt practice and/or act of the agents of respondent no.1 and as such the respondent no.1 is vicariously liable and is guilty of corrupt practices. Thus, the High Court has clearly recorded a finding of corrupt practices having been committed at the election.  Page 4 of 11 The names of persons who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of commission of the alleged corrupt practices and the nature of such practices has also been recorded. The applicability of sub-clauses (i) & (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 99 (quoted supra) is clearly attracted. The High Court did not issue any notice to any person found and named in its judgment as having committed corrupt practice. I.A.No.3 of 2000 has been filed by Shri Basudeb Bag, Superintendent of Police, Bankura, West Bengal and I.A. No.4 of 2000 has been filed by Shri Nilanjan Chatterjee presently Secretary, Women Development Undertaking, Department of Social Welfare, Government of West Bengal who was appointed as returning officer for the election in question by the Election Commission of India. Both the officers have sought for being impleaded as party-respondents or as intervenors in the appeal so as to lay challenge to the findings recorded and adverse remarks and observations made in the judgment under appeal which if not expunged may adversely affect service careers of the applicants. Their grievance is that they were not joined as parties to the election petition, they had no opportunity of hearing as they were never put on notice by the High Court and they have been condemned unheard. Section 98 of the RPA provides for an order at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition being made by the High Court whereby (a) the election petition may be dismissed, (b) the election of all or any of the returned candidates may be declared to be void, (c) in addition to the preceding relief, the election petitioner or any other candidate may be declared to have been duly elected. Section 99 provides as under : 99. Other orders to be made by the High Court. (1) At the time of making an order under section 98 [the High Court] shall also make an order [(a) where any charge is made in the petition of any corrupt practice having been committed at the election, recording (i) a finding whether any corrupt practice has or has not been proved to have been committed at the election, and the nature of that corrupt practice; and (ii) the names of all persons, if any, who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt practice and the nature of that practice; and] (b) fixing the total amount of costs payable and specifying the persons by and to whom costs shall be paid: Provided that [a person who is not a party to the petition shall not be named] in the order under sub-clause (ii) of clause (a) unless (a) he as been given notice to appear before [the High Court] and to show cause why he should not be so named; and (b) if he appears in pursuance of the notice, he has been given an opportunity of cross-examining any witness who has already been examined by [the High Court] and has given evidence against him, of calling evidence in his defence and  Page 5 of 11 of being heard. [(2) In this section and in section 100, the expression agent has the same meaning as in section 123.] The ambit and scope of Sections 98 and 99 of the Act was considered in Dr. Ramesh Yeshwant Prabhoo Vs. Prabhakar Kashinath Kunte & Ors., (1996) 1 SCC 130 wherein this court held:- While deciding the election petition at the conclusion of the trial and making an order under Section 98 disposing of the election petition in one of the ways specified therein, the High Court under Section 99 is required to record the names of all persons guilty of any corrupt practice which has been proved at the trial. Proviso to sub-section (1) then prescribes that a person who is not a party to the petition shall not be so named unless the condition specified in the proviso is fulfilled. The requirement of the proviso is only in respect of a person who is not a party to the petition and is to be named so that he too has the same opportunity which was available to a party to the petition. . . . . . . . . . . . The opportunity which a party to the petition had at the trial to defend against the allegation of corrupt practice is to be given by such a notice to that person of defending himself if he was not already a party to the petition. In other words the noticee has to be equated with a party to the petition for this purpose and is to be given the same opportunity which he would get if he was made a party to the petition. (Para 49) Again in Manohar Joshi Vs. Nitin Bhaurao Patil & Anr., (1996) 1 SCC 169, this court laid down the procedure which should be followed by the High Courts while disposing of such an election petition pointing out the fatal effect which non-compliance would have on the judgment of the High Court declaring void an election of the returned candidate. It was held:- Section 98 contemplates the making of an order thereunder in the decision of the High Court rendered at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition. . . . . . . . . . .There is nothing in Section 98 to permit the High Court to decide the election petition piecemeal and to declare the election of any returned candidate to be void at an intermediate stage of the trial when any part of the trial remains to be concluded. (Para 54) Sub-section (1) of Section 99 begins with the words At the time of making an order under Section 98 the High Court shall also make an order of the kind mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) therein. . . . . . . . There can be no doubt that the order which can be made under sub-section (1) of Section 99 has, therefore, to be made only at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition in the decision of the High Court made by an order disposing of the election petition in one of the modes prescribed in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 98. This alone is sufficient to indicate that the requirement of Section 99 is to be completed during the trial of the election petition and the final order under Section 99 has to be made in the decision of the High Court rendered under Section 98 at the conclusion of the trial of the election petition. (Para 55) The High Court cannot make an order under Section 98  Page 6 of 11 recording a finding of proof of corrupt practice against the returned candidate alone and on that basis declare the election of the returned candidate to be void and then proceed to comply with the requirement of Section 99 in the manner stated therein with a view to decide at a later stage whether any other person also is guilty of that corrupt practice for the purpose of naming him then under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. The High Court has no option in the matter to decide whether it will proceed under Section 99 against the other persons alleged to be guilty of that corrupt practice along with the returned candidate inasmuch as the requirement of Section 99 is mandatory since the finding recorded by the High Court requires it to name all persons proved at the trial to have been guilty of the corrupt practice. The expression the names of all persons, if any, who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt practice in sub-clause (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 99 clearly provides for such proof being required at the trial which means the trial of an election petition mentioned in Section 98, at the conclusion of which alone the order contemplated under Section 98 can be made. (Para 57) Therefore, the election of the appellant in the present case could not be declared void by making an order under Section 98 on the ground contained in Section 100(1)(b) of the R.P. Act without prior compliance of Section 99. Absence of notice under Section 99 of the R.P. Act vitiates the final order made under Section 98 by the High Court declaring the election to be void. (Para 60) [emphasis supplied] In Chandrakanta Goyal Vs. Sohan Singh Jodh Singh Kohli, (1996) 1 SCC 378, this court again emphasised the procedure to be followed by the Supreme Court when non-compliance by the High Court with Section 99 was brought to its notice in appeal, in these words:- Ordinarily in such a situation after setting aside the impugned judgment the matter is to be remitted to the High Court for deciding the election petition afresh after complying with the requirements of Section 99 of the Act by giving notice to the makers of the speeches and holding the requisite enquiry. The same view has been reiterated in Moreshwar Save Vs. Dwarkadas Yashwantrao Pathrikar, (1996) 1 SCC 394, wherein this court has pointed out an alternative to be followed by the Supreme Court avoiding the necessity to remand by deferring the decision in appeal and in the meantime issuing notice under Section 99 to those persons and after the requisite enquiry by the High Court, its finding in respect of those persons being called for, deciding the case against the candidate and the noticees at one time while deciding the appeal in the Supreme Court and then opined that in the case such second course did not appear to be appropriate one. All the decisions of this Court referred to hereinbefore are 3- Judges Bench decisions. A 2-Judges Bench has also taken the same view in Dr. Vimal (Mrs.) Vs. Bhaguji & Ors. (1996) 9 SCC 351.  Page 7 of 11 We too are of the opinion that the fatal defect as noticed by us in the present case vitiates the judgment under appeal and an appropriate course, in the facts and circumstances of the case, would be to set aside the judgment under appeal and remand the case to the High Court for deciding the election petition afresh after compliance with the provisions of Section 99 of R.P. Act. In view of the above said remand, I.A. No.3 and 4 are rendered redundant. The applicants in the two applications seeking intervention before us shall obviously be now noticed by the High Court and they would have a right of hearing in accordance with Section 99 of the RPA before the High Court. Accordingly the appeal is allowed. The judgment under appeal is set aside. The election petition is remanded to the High Court for deciding afresh after compliance with Section 99 of the RPA and in accordance with law. No order as to costs in this appeal. With the inevitable remand in the terms as abovesaid, the exercise of appellate jurisdiction of ours under Section 116-A of the RPA comes to an end. There are a few aspects of the case which have caused us concern and before parting with the case we would like to place on record our views in that regard. The manner in which the election petition has been tried defeats the very purpose of entrusting jurisdiction to try an election petition to the High Court by Representation of People (Amendment) Act, 1966. Out of severals, we propose to deal with only two aspects: (i) framing of issues, and (ii) recording of evidence. In para 11, sub-paragraphs (a) to (q) (in all 17 sub-paragraphs) of the election petition there are about 11 corrupt practices, all of serious nature, alleged by the petitioner. On all these corrupt practices, one sweeping issue was framed __ issue No.2, reproduced in the earlier part of this judgment. So is the case with regard to the incidents alleged in sub-paragraphs (i) to (xii) of para 27 of the election petition whereon the petitioner sought to build up a case of corrupt practice having been committed by the appellant by obtaining or procuring or abetting or attempting to obtain or procure the services from the Gazetted officers and persons in the service of Government in committing corrupt practice by improper reception of invalid votes and, refusal or rejection of valid votes materially affecting the result of election. As regards various instances of corrupt practices as alleged in these sub-paragraphs also an omnibus issue no.3, has been framed. An election petition is like a civil trial. The stage of framing the issues is an important one inasmuch as on that day the scope of the trial is determined by laying the path on which the trial shall proceed excluding diversions and departures therefrom. The date fixed for settlement of issues is, therefore, a date fixed for hearing. The real dispute between the parties is determined, the area of conflict is narrowed and the concave mirror held by the court reflecting the pleadings of the parties pinpoints into issues the disputes on which the two sides differ. The correct decision of civil lis largely depends on correct framing of issues, correctly determining the real points in controversy which need to be decided. The scheme of Order XIV of the Code of Civil Procedure dealing with settlement of issues shows that an issue arises when a material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by one party and  Page 8 of 11 denied by the other. Each material proposition affirmed by one party and denied by other should form the subject of a distinct issue. An obligation is cast on the court to read the plaint/petition and the written statement/counter, if any, and then determine with the assistance of the learned counsel for the parties, the material propositions of fact or of law on which the parties are at variance. The issues shall be framed and recorded on which the decision of the case shall depend. The parties and their counsel are bound to assist the court in the process of framing of issues. Duty of the counsel does not belittle the primary obligation cast on the court. It is for the Presiding Judge to exert himself so as to frame sufficiently expressive issues. An omission to frame proper issues may be a ground for remanding the case for retrial subject to prejudice having been shown to have resulted by the omission. The petition may be disposed of at the first hearing if it appears that the parties are not at issue on any material question of law or of fact and the court may at once pronounce the judgment. If the parties are at issue on some questions of law or of fact, the suit or petition shall be fixed for trial calling upon the parties to adduce evidence on issues of fact. The evidence shall be confined to issues and the pleadings. No evidence on controversies, not covered by issues and the pleadings, shall normally be admitted, for each party leads evidence in support of issues the burden of proving which lies on him. The object of an issue is to tie down the evidence and arguments and decision to a particular question so that there may be no doubt on what the dispute is. The judgment, then proceeding issue-wise would be able to tell precisely how the dispute was decided. In the case at hand, each one of the corrupt practices alleged by the petitioner and denied by the defendant, should have formed the subject matter of a distinct issue sufficiently expressive of the material proposition of fact and of law arising from the pleadings. Failure to do so has resulted in an utter confusion prevailing throughout the trial and also in the judgment of the High Court as was demonstrated by the learned counsel for the appellant during the hearing of the appeal attacking the findings arrived at by High Court. On some of the points in dispute the High Court has observed that no proof of the said fact (alleged in the petition) was necessary so far as the petitioner is concerned because there was no specific denial of the allegations made or as there was no answer by the defendant to the allegations of the petitioner on points of substance. The contradiction with which the trial and the judgment suffer is writ large. If a material proposition of fact or law alleged in the petition was not denied or was not specifically denied in the written statement within the meaning of Rule 5 of Order 8 of C.P.C. and such tenor of the written statement had persuaded the learned designated Election Judge in forming an opinion (belatedly while writing the judgment) that there was an admission by necessary implication for want of denial or specific denial then there was no need of framing an issue and there was no need for recording of evidence on those issues. Valuable time of the court would have been saved from being wasted in recording evidence on such averments in pleadings as were not in issue for want of traverse, if it was so! However, in the facts of the present case, we are of the opinion that the defective framing of the issues though material, has not vitiated the trial inasmuch as we are  Page 9 of 11 satisfied that the parties have gone to the trial with full knowledge of the allegations and counter allegations made in the pleadings. None of the parties has complained of prejudice. None had made a prayer to the High Court, before going for trial, for amending or striking down any of the issues. We need say no more about the issues. Now as to the recording of evidence. During the hearing of appeal the learned counsel for the parties took us through several statements of witnesses and read out many a passages while assailing or supporting the findings arrived at by the learned Designated Election Judge. A few aspects as to the examination of the witnesses and the manner of recording statements need to be adverted to. The record of evidence shows : 1. The statements of the witnesses are recorded not in narrative but in question-answer form. During the course of hearing in appeal we asked the learned counsel for the parties about this feature. We were told that such is the practice prevalent on the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court. 2. The witnesses are named but not numbered. 3. Some of the witnesses are asked a few preliminary questions the relevance whereof we have not been able to appreciate. Many a witness has been asked whether he was appearing in the Court on sub-poena and then asked to produce the sub-poena in the Court for perusal of the presiding judge. 4. A host of such questions have been asked, both in examination- in-chief and in cross-examination, as are not permitted by the provisions of the Evidence Act. To wit, witnesses (other than the parties) have been confronted with the contents of the election petition or the written statement and asked to make comments or offer explanation as to passages therefrom, overlooking that Section 145 of the Evidence Act permits a witness being cross-examined as to previous statement made by him and not by a third person. How can a witness be confronted or asked to explain the contents of or averments made in writing or document to which he is not a party? Same or similar questions have been allowed to be asked again and again. At places the witnesses have been grilled and compelled to answer embarrassing questions. The statements of 18 witnesses examined by the parties have been placed before us in 18 volumes some of which run into about a hundred or even hundreds of pages each. We are told that 120 days were consumed in recording the evidence. The learned counsel were agreeable that if only the conducting of examination-in-chief and cross-examination would have been effectively controlled, the recording of evidence could have been concluded in less than half of the time than what has been consumed and the bulk of the evidence could have been reduced to one-third or one-fourth of what it is. The reason behind giving such a long rope in examining and cross examining the witnesses, surprisingly enough what we were told is that in the trial of an election petition, the atmosphere is surcharged, conducting counsel get over-zealous and it is not considered advisable by the Court to interrupt the conducting of examination and cross examination of the witnesses by the counsel. We are not amused at all. Curtailing delays is essential to expeditious disposal of the cases. Speedy disposal is the cry of the day. Courts cannot act as silent spectators when evidence is being recorded. Judges must have full control over the file and effectively conduct proceedings keeping in   11 view that no litigant has any such right as to waste the precious time of the court. In almost all the courts in the country holding trials in civil and criminal cases, the oral examination of the witnesses though conducted in question-answer form by the counsel, is generally recorded in narrative by the presiding judges. The court has power to regulate the manner of recording evidence. In spite of the manner of recording evidence being in narrative the presiding judge can wherever necessary direct a particular question or group of questions to be recorded in question-answer form. Wherever necessary a note as to demeanour of a witness can always be made by the presiding judge before whom the witness is being examined and such note on demeanour made in the presence of the witness and counsel for both the parties would be more useful to the trial court itself while hearing arguments of the counsel for the parties at the end of the trial and also for the appellate court rather than a mere record of the statement in question-answer form. Incidentally, and interestingly, it may be noticed that when the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was enacted, repealing the 1898 Code, section 276 was introduced providing for evidence to be ordinarily taken down in the form of question and answer but vesting a discretion in the presiding judge to record the evidence in the form of a narrative. Within three years the Law Commission of India found this system causing delay in trial and hence not workable and on its recommendation, by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act (45 of 1978), section 276 was amended so as to provide that in trial before courts of session evidence shall ordinarily be taken down in the form of a narrative but the presiding judge may in his discretion take down or cause to be taken down any part of such evidence in the form of question and answer. Thus recording of evidence in narrative form is the rule. Such mode of recording evidence is statutorily provided for session trials where life and liberty of persons is at stake. We fail to understand why the recording of evidence in narrative cannot be a mode to be followed in the trial of election petitions. Assigning serial numbers to the witnesses on their depositions such as PW1 (and so on) for petitioners witnesses and RW1 or DW1 (and so on) for the respondents or defendants witnesses would provide a convenient mode of referring to the witnesses during the course of hearing and while writing the judgment. We hope Calcutta High Court would consider suitably amending its rules or practice as applicable to Original Side and/or to trial of election petitions. It is not necessary to ask each witness whether he is appearing on sub-poena and to have the sub-poena produced for the perusal of the Court. Whether a witness is on sub-poena or not is a matter of record known to the parties, the court and the witness. If a doubt or dispute may arise reference can be had to the record. Such questions, asked in routine, add only to the length of the deposition and are avoidable. An election petition is not a dispute between the petitioner and respondent merely; the fate of the constituency is on trial. A Judge presiding over the trial of an election petition, and any trial for the matter of that, needs to effectively control examination, cross examination and re-examination of the witnesses so as to exclude such questions being put to the witnesses as the law   of 11 does not permit and to relieve the witnesses from the need of answering such questions which they are not bound to answer. Power to disallow questions should be effectively exercised by reference to Sections 146, 148, 150, 151 and 152 of the Evidence Act by excluding improper and impermissble questions. The examination of the witnesses should not be protracted and the witness should not feel harassed. The cross- examiner must not be allowed to bully or take unfair advantage of the witness. Though the trials in India are adversarial, the power vesting in the court to ask any question to a witness at any time in the interest of justice gives the trial a little touch of its being inquisitorial. Witnesses attend the court to discharge the sacred duty of rendering aid to justice. They are entitled to be treated with respect and it is the judge who has to see that they feel confident in the court. In Ram Chander Vs. State of Haryana AIR 1981 SC 1036 this Court observed, . . . . . . . to be an effective instrument in dispensing justice, the presiding judge must cease to be a spectator and a mere recording machine. He must become a participant in the trial by evincing intelligent active interest. . . . . . . .. An alert judge actively participating in court proceedings with a firm grip on oars enables the trial smoothly negotiating on shorter routes avoiding prolixity and expeditiously attaining the destination of just decision. The interest of the counsel for the parties in conducting the trial in such a way as to gain success for their respective clients is understandable but the obligation of the presiding judge to hold the proceedings so as to achieve the dual objective __ search for truth and delivering justice expeditiously __ cannot be subdued. Howsoever sensitive the subj","R.C. Lahoti, J. L.....I.........T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J This appeal under Section 116-A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (hereinafter the RPA, for short) has been preferred by a candidate who won at the election but has lost in the election petition. Elections for the legislative seat of No.216, Sabang Legislative Assembly Constituency in the district of Midnapore, West Bengal were held in May, 1996. There were four candidates in the fray. The appellant secured 60453 votes. The respondent no.1 secured 59628 votes. The other two candidates received 594 and 453 votes respectively. On 12.5.1996 the appellant was declared elected by a margin of 825 votes over his nearest rival, the respondent no.1. On 17.6.1996, the respondent no.1 filed an election petition laying challenge to the election of the appellant and seeking a declaration that the result of the election was void. A declaration that the respondent no.1 was duly elected was also sought for. On trial the High Court has allowed the election petition and set aside the election of the appellant declaring the same to be void. No other direction has been made. The appellant and two other candidates who had contested the election were only arrayed as the respondents in the election petition filed before the High Court. It is not necessary to set out the pleadings, evidence and other details of the case in view of our having formed an opinion that the judgment under appeal suffers from a serious lacuna going to the root of the matter and therefore deserves to be set aside followed by a remand to the High Court with a direction to comply with the provisions of Section 99 of the RPA and thereafter decide the election petition afresh. The facts insofar as necessary to demonstrate the need for remand are stated in brief hereinafter. The principal ground on which the election of the   of 11 appellant was sought to be set aside was that the result of the election, insofar as it concerns the returned candidate was materially affected by corrupt practices committed in the interests of the returned candidate by the agents other than his election agent within the meaning of Section 100 (1)(d) (ii) of the RPA. The election petition alleged commission of corrupt practices as defined in sub-sections (2) (4) and (7) of Section 123 of the the RPA. For the purpose of this appeal it would suffice to note the issues framed by the High Court, the answers given and the findings recorded by the High Court. Issues (1) Is the election petition maintainable in the present form? (2) Is the respondent no.1, his election agent and/or his election agents is/are guilty of corrupt practices as alleged in paragraph 11 and sub-paragraphs thereunder of the election petition? (3) Is the respondent no.1, his election agents, the Returning Officer, Assistant Returning Officer, counting Supervisors, counting Assistants acting as agent of the respondent no.1 resorted to corrupt practices as alleged in paragraph 27 and sub-paragraphs thereunder under of the said election petition? (4) Is the election petitioner entitled to a declaration that the election of the respondent no.1 from the said 216, Sabang Legislative Assembly Constituency void? (5) Was the Returning Officer of the said Assembly Constituency biased in favour of the respondent no.1? (6) Is the election petitioner entitled to a declaration that the petitioner has been duly elected to the said constituency having received majority of valid votes? (7) Is the election petitioner entitled to recounting of votes under the supervision of this court as prayed for in the petition? (8) What relief, if any, the election petitioner is entitled to? Findings : Issues settled are answered in the manner following Issue No.1 - The election petition is maintainable. Issue No.2 - The respondent no.1, election agent and agents are guilty of corrupt practices. Issue No.3 - The respondent no.1, the Returning Officer, the Assistant Returning Officer, the Counting Supervisor, Counting Assistant acting as agent of the respondent no.1 and resorted to corrupt practices. I am not, however, inclined to declare the petitioner as elected or secured majority of votes. There is no question of recounting in the instant case inasmuch as the  Page 3 of 11 election is vitiated by corrupt practices since the election is declared void. So far Issue Nos.2 and 3 are concerned, they are decided in the affirmative. I am of the view that the petitioner cannot be declared as elected. For all the aforesaid reasons, in my view, it is proved that corrupt practices had been committed under Sections 123(2), 123(4) and 123(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by the returned candidate and/or his agents and the election of 216 Sabang Legislative Assembly constituency declaring the respondent no.1 should be declared void. (Sic.) Considering all aspects of the matter I am of the view that corrupt practice under Sections 123(2), 123(4) and 123(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by the respondent no.1 and/or his agents has been proved in this case. Accordingly it is declared that the election of the respondent no.1 being the returned candidate from 216-Sabang Legislative Assembly Constituency is void. In addition to the findings arrived at (extracted and reproduced as hereinabove from the operative part of the judgment of the High Court), a few other findings from the body of the judgment, not all but only a few by way of illustration, are extracted and reproduced, so as to demonstrate how, in the light of its own findings, the High Court has failed in discharging its statutory obligation cast by Section 99 of the the RPA resulting in vitiating the judgment. Those findings are: . . . . . . . . . it can be safely concluded from a careful reading of the written statement that (a) Hem Bhattacharya, Dipak Sarkar, Debasis Bose, Nilanjan Chatterjee, Returning Officer, Anindya Kar, Block Development Officer and Assistant Returning Officer, Kushal Mitra, Officer-in-Charge of Sabang Police Station, Pradip Das, Joint BDO, Sabang, Hare Krishna Jana, Sabhapati, Sabang Panchayat Samity; Chitta Bera, election agent of respondent no.1 and Basudeb Bag. Addl. S.P. Burdwan, all acted as agents of respondent no.1 being the part of the election machinery of CPI(M). It is further proved by admission that the political machinery of CPI(M) actively engaged itself not only to propagate for the respondent no.1 but also ensured win of the respondent no.1 by commission of several corrupt practices mentioned in the petition as agent of respondent no.1. xxx xxx xxx xxx It is clearly established from his evidence and also from several exhibits that the machinery of the CPI(M) its nemerous workers, cadres activists and supporters were all working for respondent no.1 as his agents and that the said corrupt practices committed by CPI(M) workers and leaders are no more than the works of the agents of respondent no.1 and for each such corrupt practice and/or act of the agents of respondent no.1 and as such the respondent no.1 is vicariously liable and is guilty of corrupt practices. Thus, the High Court has clearly recorded a finding of corrupt practices having been committed at the election.  Page 4 of 11 The names of persons who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of commission of the alleged corrupt practices and the nature of such practices has also been recorded. The applicability of sub-clauses (i) & (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 99 (quoted supra) is clearly attracted. The High Court did not issue any notice to any person found and named in its judgment as having committed corrupt practice. I.A.No.3 of 2000 has been filed by Shri Basudeb Bag, Superintendent of Police, Bankura, West Bengal and I.A. No.4 of 2000 has been filed by Shri Nilanjan Chatterjee presently Secretary, Women Development Undertaking, Department of Social Welfare, Government of West Bengal who was appointed as returning officer for the election in question by the Election Commission of India. Both the officers have sought for being impleaded as party-respondents or as intervenors in the appeal so as to lay challenge to the findings recorded and adverse remarks and observations made in the judgment under appeal which if not expunged may adversely affect service careers of the applicants. Their grievance is that they were not joined as parties to the election petition, they had no opportunity of hearing as they were never put on notice by the High Court and they have been condemned unheard. Section 98 of the RPA provides for an order at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition being made by the High Court whereby (a) the election petition may be dismissed, (b) the election of all or any of the returned candidates may be declared to be void, (c) in addition to the preceding relief, the election petitioner or any other candidate may be declared to have been duly elected. Section 99 provides as under : 99. Other orders to be made by the High Court. (1) At the time of making an order under section 98 [the High Court] shall also make an order [(a) where any charge is made in the petition of any corrupt practice having been committed at the election, recording (i) a finding whether any corrupt practice has or has not been proved to have been committed at the election, and the nature of that corrupt practice; and (ii) the names of all persons, if any, who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt practice and the nature of that practice; and] (b) fixing the total amount of costs payable and specifying the persons by and to whom costs shall be paid: Provided that [a person who is not a party to the petition shall not be named] in the order under sub-clause (ii) of clause (a) unless (a) he as been given notice to appear before [the High Court] and to show cause why he should not be so named; and (b) if he appears in pursuance of the notice, he has been given an opportunity of cross-examining any witness who has already been examined by [the High Court] and has given evidence against him, of calling evidence in his defence and  Page 5 of 11 of being heard. [(2) In this section and in section 100, the expression agent has the same meaning as in section 123.] The ambit and scope of Sections 98 and 99 of the Act was considered in Dr. Ramesh Yeshwant Prabhoo Vs. Prabhakar Kashinath Kunte & Ors., (1996) 1 SCC 130 wherein this court held:- While deciding the election petition at the conclusion of the trial and making an order under Section 98 disposing of the election petition in one of the ways specified therein, the High Court under Section 99 is required to record the names of all persons guilty of any corrupt practice which has been proved at the trial. Proviso to sub-section (1) then prescribes that a person who is not a party to the petition shall not be so named unless the condition specified in the proviso is fulfilled. The requirement of the proviso is only in respect of a person who is not a party to the petition and is to be named so that he too has the same opportunity which was available to a party to the petition. . . . . . . . . . . . The opportunity which a party to the petition had at the trial to defend against the allegation of corrupt practice is to be given by such a notice to that person of defending himself if he was not already a party to the petition. In other words the noticee has to be equated with a party to the petition for this purpose and is to be given the same opportunity which he would get if he was made a party to the petition. (Para 49) Again in Manohar Joshi Vs. Nitin Bhaurao Patil & Anr., (1996) 1 SCC 169, this court laid down the procedure which should be followed by the High Courts while disposing of such an election petition pointing out the fatal effect which non-compliance would have on the judgment of the High Court declaring void an election of the returned candidate. It was held:- Section 98 contemplates the making of an order thereunder in the decision of the High Court rendered at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition. . . . . . . . . . .There is nothing in Section 98 to permit the High Court to decide the election petition piecemeal and to declare the election of any returned candidate to be void at an intermediate stage of the trial when any part of the trial remains to be concluded. (Para 54) Sub-section (1) of Section 99 begins with the words At the time of making an order under Section 98 the High Court shall also make an order of the kind mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) therein. . . . . . . . There can be no doubt that the order which can be made under sub-section (1) of Section 99 has, therefore, to be made only at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition in the decision of the High Court made by an order disposing of the election petition in one of the modes prescribed in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 98. This alone is sufficient to indicate that the requirement of Section 99 is to be completed during the trial of the election petition and the final order under Section 99 has to be made in the decision of the High Court rendered under Section 98 at the conclusion of the trial of the election petition. (Para 55) The High Court cannot make an order under Section 98  Page 6 of 11 recording a finding of proof of corrupt practice against the returned candidate alone and on that basis declare the election of the returned candidate to be void and then proceed to comply with the requirement of Section 99 in the manner stated therein with a view to decide at a later stage whether any other person also is guilty of that corrupt practice for the purpose of naming him then under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. The High Court has no option in the matter to decide whether it will proceed under Section 99 against the other persons alleged to be guilty of that corrupt practice along with the returned candidate inasmuch as the requirement of Section 99 is mandatory since the finding recorded by the High Court requires it to name all persons proved at the trial to have been guilty of the corrupt practice. The expression the names of all persons, if any, who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt practice in sub-clause (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 99 clearly provides for such proof being required at the trial which means the trial of an election petition mentioned in Section 98, at the conclusion of which alone the order contemplated under Section 98 can be made. (Para 57) Therefore, the election of the appellant in the present case could not be declared void by making an order under Section 98 on the ground contained in Section 100(1)(b) of the R.P. Act without prior compliance of Section 99. Absence of notice under Section 99 of the R.P. Act vitiates the final order made under Section 98 by the High Court declaring the election to be void. (Para 60) [emphasis supplied] In Chandrakanta Goyal Vs. Sohan Singh Jodh Singh Kohli, (1996) 1 SCC 378, this court again emphasised the procedure to be followed by the Supreme Court when non-compliance by the High Court with Section 99 was brought to its notice in appeal, in these words:- Ordinarily in such a situation after setting aside the impugned judgment the matter is to be remitted to the High Court for deciding the election petition afresh after complying with the requirements of Section 99 of the Act by giving notice to the makers of the speeches and holding the requisite enquiry. The same view has been reiterated in Moreshwar Save Vs. Dwarkadas Yashwantrao Pathrikar, (1996) 1 SCC 394, wherein this court has pointed out an alternative to be followed by the Supreme Court avoiding the necessity to remand by deferring the decision in appeal and in the meantime issuing notice under Section 99 to those persons and after the requisite enquiry by the High Court, its finding in respect of those persons being called for, deciding the case against the candidate and the noticees at one time while deciding the appeal in the Supreme Court and then opined that in the case such second course did not appear to be appropriate one. All the decisions of this Court referred to hereinbefore are 3- Judges Bench decisions. A 2-Judges Bench has also taken the same view in Dr. Vimal (Mrs.) Vs. Bhaguji & Ors. (1996) 9 SCC 351.  Page 7 of 11 We too are of the opinion that the fatal defect as noticed by us in the present case vitiates the judgment under appeal and an appropriate course, in the facts and circumstances of the case, would be to set aside the judgment under appeal and remand the case to the High Court for deciding the election petition afresh after compliance with the provisions of Section 99 of R.P. Act. In view of the above said remand, I.A. No.3 and 4 are rendered redundant. The applicants in the two applications seeking intervention before us shall obviously be now noticed by the High Court and they would have a right of hearing in accordance with Section 99 of the RPA before the High Court. Accordingly the appeal is allowed. The judgment under appeal is set aside. The election petition is remanded to the High Court for deciding afresh after compliance with Section 99 of the RPA and in accordance with law. No order as to costs in this appeal. With the inevitable remand in the terms as abovesaid, the exercise of appellate jurisdiction of ours under Section 116-A of the RPA comes to an end. There are a few aspects of the case which have caused us concern and before parting with the case we would like to place on record our views in that regard. The manner in which the election petition has been tried defeats the very purpose of entrusting jurisdiction to try an election petition to the High Court by Representation of People (Amendment) Act, 1966. Out of severals, we propose to deal with only two aspects: (i) framing of issues, and (ii) recording of evidence. In para 11, sub-paragraphs (a) to (q) (in all 17 sub-paragraphs) of the election petition there are about 11 corrupt practices, all of serious nature, alleged by the petitioner. On all these corrupt practices, one sweeping issue was framed __ issue No.2, reproduced in the earlier part of this judgment. So is the case with regard to the incidents alleged in sub-paragraphs (i) to (xii) of para 27 of the election petition whereon the petitioner sought to build up a case of corrupt practice having been committed by the appellant by obtaining or procuring or abetting or attempting to obtain or procure the services from the Gazetted officers and persons in the service of Government in committing corrupt practice by improper reception of invalid votes and, refusal or rejection of valid votes materially affecting the result of election. As regards various instances of corrupt practices as alleged in these sub-paragraphs also an omnibus issue no.3, has been framed. An election petition is like a civil trial. The stage of framing the issues is an important one inasmuch as on that day the scope of the trial is determined by laying the path on which the trial shall proceed excluding diversions and departures therefrom. The date fixed for settlement of issues is, therefore, a date fixed for hearing. The real dispute between the parties is determined, the area of conflict is narrowed and the concave mirror held by the court reflecting the pleadings of the parties pinpoints into issues the disputes on which the two sides differ. The correct decision of civil lis largely depends on correct framing of issues, correctly determining the real points in controversy which need to be decided. The scheme of Order XIV of the Code of Civil Procedure dealing with settlement of issues shows that an issue arises when a material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by one party and  Page 8 of 11 denied by the other. Each material proposition affirmed by one party and denied by other should form the subject of a distinct issue. An obligation is cast on the court to read the plaint/petition and the written statement/counter, if any, and then determine with the assistance of the learned counsel for the parties, the material propositions of fact or of law on which the parties are at variance. The issues shall be framed and recorded on which the decision of the case shall depend. The parties and their counsel are bound to assist the court in the process of framing of issues. Duty of the counsel does not belittle the primary obligation cast on the court. It is for the Presiding Judge to exert himself so as to frame sufficiently expressive issues. An omission to frame proper issues may be a ground for remanding the case for retrial subject to prejudice having been shown to have resulted by the omission. The petition may be disposed of at the first hearing if it appears that the parties are not at issue on any material question of law or of fact and the court may at once pronounce the judgment. If the parties are at issue on some questions of law or of fact, the suit or petition shall be fixed for trial calling upon the parties to adduce evidence on issues of fact. The evidence shall be confined to issues and the pleadings. No evidence on controversies, not covered by issues and the pleadings, shall normally be admitted, for each party leads evidence in support of issues the burden of proving which lies on him. The object of an issue is to tie down the evidence and arguments and decision to a particular question so that there may be no doubt on what the dispute is. The judgment, then proceeding issue-wise would be able to tell precisely how the dispute was decided. In the case at hand, each one of the corrupt practices alleged by the petitioner and denied by the defendant, should have formed the subject matter of a distinct issue sufficiently expressive of the material proposition of fact and of law arising from the pleadings. Failure to do so has resulted in an utter confusion prevailing throughout the trial and also in the judgment of the High Court as was demonstrated by the learned counsel for the appellant during the hearing of the appeal attacking the findings arrived at by High Court. On some of the points in dispute the High Court has observed that no proof of the said fact (alleged in the petition) was necessary so far as the petitioner is concerned because there was no specific denial of the allegations made or as there was no answer by the defendant to the allegations of the petitioner on points of substance. The contradiction with which the trial and the judgment suffer is writ large. If a material proposition of fact or law alleged in the petition was not denied or was not specifically denied in the written statement within the meaning of Rule 5 of Order 8 of C.P.C. and such tenor of the written statement had persuaded the learned designated Election Judge in forming an opinion (belatedly while writing the judgment) that there was an admission by necessary implication for want of denial or specific denial then there was no need of framing an issue and there was no need for recording of evidence on those issues. Valuable time of the court would have been saved from being wasted in recording evidence on such averments in pleadings as were not in issue for want of traverse, if it was so! However, in the facts of the present case, we are of the opinion that the defective framing of the issues though material, has not vitiated the trial inasmuch as we are  Page 9 of 11 satisfied that the parties have gone to the trial with full knowledge of the allegations and counter allegations made in the pleadings. None of the parties has complained of prejudice. None had made a prayer to the High Court, before going for trial, for amending or striking down any of the issues. We need say no more about the issues. Now as to the recording of evidence. During the hearing of appeal the learned counsel for the parties took us through several statements of witnesses and read out many a passages while assailing or supporting the findings arrived at by the learned Designated Election Judge. A few aspects as to the examination of the witnesses and the manner of recording statements need to be adverted to. The record of evidence shows : 1. The statements of the witnesses are recorded not in narrative but in question-answer form. During the course of hearing in appeal we asked the learned counsel for the parties about this feature. We were told that such is the practice prevalent on the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court. 2. The witnesses are named but not numbered. 3. Some of the witnesses are asked a few preliminary questions the relevance whereof we have not been able to appreciate. Many a witness has been asked whether he was appearing in the Court on sub-poena and then asked to produce the sub-poena in the Court for perusal of the presiding judge. 4. A host of such questions have been asked, both in examination- in-chief and in cross-examination, as are not permitted by the provisions of the Evidence Act. To wit, witnesses (other than the parties) have been confronted with the contents of the election petition or the written statement and asked to make comments or offer explanation as to passages therefrom, overlooking that Section 145 of the Evidence Act permits a witness being cross-examined as to previous statement made by him and not by a third person. How can a witness be confronted or asked to explain the contents of or averments made in writing or document to which he is not a party? Same or similar questions have been allowed to be asked again and again. At places the witnesses have been grilled and compelled to answer embarrassing questions. The statements of 18 witnesses examined by the parties have been placed before us in 18 volumes some of which run into about a hundred or even hundreds of pages each. We are told that 120 days were consumed in recording the evidence. The learned counsel were agreeable that if only the conducting of examination-in-chief and cross-examination would have been effectively controlled, the recording of evidence could have been concluded in less than half of the time than what has been consumed and the bulk of the evidence could have been reduced to one-third or one-fourth of what it is. The reason behind giving such a long rope in examining and cross examining the witnesses, surprisingly enough what we were told is that in the trial of an election petition, the atmosphere is surcharged, conducting counsel get over-zealous and it is not considered advisable by the Court to interrupt the conducting of examination and cross examination of the witnesses by the counsel. We are not amused at all. Curtailing delays is essential to expeditious disposal of the cases. Speedy disposal is the cry of the day. Courts cannot act as silent spectators when evidence is being recorded. Judges must have full control over the file and effectively conduct proceedings keeping in   11 view that no litigant has any such right as to waste the precious time of the court. In almost all the courts in the country holding trials in civil and criminal cases, the oral examination of the witnesses though conducted in question-answer form by the counsel, is generally recorded in narrative by the presiding judges. The court has power to regulate the manner of recording evidence. In spite of the manner of recording evidence being in narrative the presiding judge can wherever necessary direct a particular question or group of questions to be recorded in question-answer form. Wherever necessary a note as to demeanour of a witness can always be made by the presiding judge before whom the witness is being examined and such note on demeanour made in the presence of the witness and counsel for both the parties would be more useful to the trial court itself while hearing arguments of the counsel for the parties at the end of the trial and also for the appellate court rather than a mere record of the statement in question-answer form. Incidentally, and interestingly, it may be noticed that when the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was enacted, repealing the 1898 Code, section 276 was introduced providing for evidence to be ordinarily taken down in the form of question and answer but vesting a discretion in the presiding judge to record the evidence in the form of a narrative. Within three years the Law Commission of India found this system causing delay in trial and hence not workable and on its recommendation, by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act (45 of 1978), section 276 was amended so as to provide that in trial before courts of session evidence shall ordinarily be taken down in the form of a narrative but the presiding judge may in his discretion take down or cause to be taken down any part of such evidence in the form of question and answer. Thus recording of evidence in narrative form is the rule. Such mode of recording evidence is statutorily provided for session trials where life and liberty of persons is at stake. We fail to understand why the recording of evidence in narrative cannot be a mode to be followed in the trial of election petitions. Assigning serial numbers to the witnesses on their depositions such as PW1 (and so on) for petitioners witnesses and RW1 or DW1 (and so on) for the respondents or defendants witnesses would provide a convenient mode of referring to the witnesses during the course of hearing and while writing the judgment. We hope Calcutta High Court would consider suitably amending its rules or practice as applicable to Original Side and/or to trial of election petitions. It is not necessary to ask each witness whether he is appearing on sub-poena and to have the sub-poena produced for the perusal of the Court. Whether a witness is on sub-poena or not is a matter of record known to the parties, the court and the witness. If a doubt or dispute may arise reference can be had to the record. Such questions, asked in routine, add only to the length of the deposition and are avoidable. An election petition is not a dispute between the petitioner and respondent merely; the fate of the constituency is on trial. A Judge presiding over the trial of an election petition, and any trial for the matter of that, needs to effectively control examination, cross examination and re-examination of the witnesses so as to exclude such questions being put to the witnesses as the law   of 11 does not permit and to relieve the witnesses from the need of answering such questions which they are not bound to answer. Power to disallow questions should be effectively exercised by reference to Sections 146, 148, 150, 151 and 152 of the Evidence Act by excluding improper and impermissble questions. The examination of the witnesses should not be protracted and the witness should not feel harassed. The cross- examiner must not be allowed to bully or take unfair advantage of the witness. Though the trials in India are adversarial, the power vesting in the court to ask any question to a witness at any time in the interest of justice gives the trial a little touch of its being inquisitorial. Witnesses attend the court to discharge the sacred duty of rendering aid to justice. They are entitled to be treated with respect and it is the judge who has to see that they feel confident in the court. In Ram Chander Vs. State of Haryana AIR 1981 SC 1036 this Court observed, . . . . . . . to be an effective instrument in dispensing justice, the presiding judge must cease to be a spectator and a mere recording machine. He must become a participant in the trial by evincing intelligent active interest. . . . . . . .. An alert judge actively participating in court proceedings with a firm grip on oars enables the trial smoothly negotiating on shorter routes avoiding prolixity and expeditiously attaining the destination of just decision. The interest of the counsel for the parties in conducting the trial in such a way as to gain success for their respective clients is understandable but the obligation of the presiding judge to hold the proceedings so as to achieve the dual objective __ search for truth and delivering justice expeditiously __ cannot be subdued. Howsoever sensitive the subj"
7,Appeal (civil) 4105 of 1999,MAKHAN LAL BANGAL,MANAS BHUNIA AND ORS.,3/1/2001,DR. A.S. ANAND CJ & R.C. LAHOTI & SHIVA RAJ V. PATIL,"2001 (1) SCR 17 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by R.C. LAHOTI, J. This appeal under Section 116-A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (hereinafter ’the RPA’, for short) has been preferred by a candidate who won at the election but has lost in the election petition. Elections for the legislative seat of No. 216, Sabang Legislative Assembly Constituency in the district of Midnapore, West Bengal were held in May, 1996. There were four candidates in the fray. The appellant secured 60453 votes. The respondent no. 1 secured 59628 votes. The other two candidates received 594 and 453 votes respectively. On 12.5.1996 the appellant was declared elected by a margin of 825 votes over his nearest rival, the respondent no. .1. On 17.6.1996, the respondent no.l filed an election petition laying challenge to the election of the appellant and seeking a declaration that the result of the election was void. A declaration that the respondent no. 1 was duly elected was also sought for. On trial the High Court has allowed the election petition and set aside the election of the appellant declaring the same to be void. No other direction has been made. The appellant and two other candidates who had contested the election were only arrayed as the respondents in the election petition filed before the High Court. ISSUES It is not necessary to set out the pleadings, evidence and other details of the case in view of our having formed an opinion that the judgment under appeal suffers from a serious lacuna going to the root of the matter and therefore deserves to be set aside followed by a remand to the High Court with a direction to Comply with the provisions of Section 99 of the RPA and thereafter decide the election petition afresh. The fact insofar as necessary to demonstrate the need for remand are stated in brief hereinafter. The principal ground on which the election of the appellant was sought to be set aside was that the result of the election, insofar as it concerns the returned candidate was materially affected by corrupt practices committed in the interests of the returned candidate by the agent other than his election agent within the meaning of Section 100(l)(d) (ii) of the RPA. The election petition alleged commission of corrupt practices as defined in sub-sections (2) (4) and (7) of Section 123 of the RPA. For the purpose of this appeal it would suffice to note the issues framed by the High Court, the answers given and the findings recorded by the High Court. (1) Is the election petition maintainable in the present form?   of 9 (2) Is the respondent no.l, his election agent and/or his election agent is/are guilty of corrupt practices as alleged in paragraph 11 and sub paragraphs thereunder of the election petition? (3) Is the respondent no. 1, his election agents, the Returning Officer, Assistant returning Officer, counting Supervisors, counting Assistants acting as agent of the respondent no. 1 resorted to corrupt practices as alleged in paragraph 27 and sub-paragraphs thereunder of the said election petition? (4) Is the election petitioner entitled to a declaration that the election of the respondent no.l from the said 216, Sabang Legislative Assembly Constituency void? (5) Was the Returning Officer of the said Assembly Constituency biased in favour of the respondent no. 1? (6) Is the election petitioner entitled to a declaration that the petitioner had been duly elected to the said constituency having received majority of valid votes? (7) Is the election petitioner entitled to recounting of votes under the supervision of this court as prayed for in the petition? (8) What relief, if any, the election petitioner is entitled to? Findings ""Issues settled are answered in the manner following:-Issue No.-1 The election petition is maintainable. Issue No. 2-The respondent no.l, election agent and agents are guilty of corrupt practices. Issue No. 3-The respondent no. l, the Returning Officer, the Assistant Returning Officer, the Counting Supervisor, Counting Assistant acting as agent of the respondent no. l and resorted to corrupt practices. I am not, however, inclined to declare the petitioner as elected or secured majority of votes. There is no question of recounting in the instant case inasmuch as the election is vitiated by corrupt practices since the election is declared void. So far Issue Nos. 2 and 3 are concerned, they are decided in the affirmative. I am of the view that the petitioner cannot be declared as elected. For all the aforesaid reasons, in view, it is proved that corrupt practices had been committed under Section 123(2), 123(4) and 123(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by the returned candidate and/or his agents and the election of 216 Sabang Legislative Assembly constituency declaring the respondent no. 1 should be declared void. (Sic) Considering all aspects of the matter I am of the view that corrupt practice under Section 123(2), 123(4) and 123(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by the respondent no. 1 and/or his agents has been proved in this case. Accordingly it is declared that the election of the respondent no. 1 being the returned candidate from 216-Sabang Legislative Assembly constituency is void."" In addition to the findings arrived at (extracted and reproduced as hereinabove from the operative part of the judgment of the High Court), a few other findings from the body of the judgment, not all but only a few by  Page 3 of 9 way of illustration, are extracted and reproduced, so as to demonstrate how, in the light of its own findings, the High Court has failed in discharging its statutory obligation cast by Section 99 of the RPA resulting in vitiating the judgment. Those findings are; "".....it can be safely concluded from a careful reading of the written statement that (a) Hem Bhattacharya, Dipak Sarkar, Debasis Bose, Nilanjan Chatterjee, Returning officer, Aniandya kar, Block Development Officer and Assistant Returning Officer, Kushal Mitra, Officer -in-charge of Sabang Police Station, Pradip Das, Joint BDO, Sabang, Hare Krishna Jana, Sabhapati, Sabang Panchayat Samity; Chitta Bera, election agent of respondent no.) and Basudep Bag. Addl. S.P. Burdwan, all acted as agents of respondent no.1 being the part of the election machinery of CPI(M). It is further proved by admission that the political machinery of CPI(M) actively engaged itself not only to propagate for the respondent no.1 but also ensured win of the respondent no. 1 by commission of several corrupt practices mentioned in the petition as agent of respondent no. 1."" xxx xxx xxx It is clearly established from his evidence and also from several exhibits that the machinery of the GPI(M) its nuemerous workers, cadres activists and supporters were all working for respondent no.l as his agents and that the said corrupt practices committed by CPI(M) workers and leaders are no more than the works of the agent of respondent no. 1 and for each such corrupt practice and/or act of the agents of respondent no. 1 and as such the respondent no.1 is vicariously liable and is guilty of corrupt practices."" Thus, the high Court has clearly recorded a finding of corrupt practices having been committed at the election. The names of person who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of commission of the alleged corrupt practices and the nature of such practices has also been recorded. The applicability of sub-clauses (i) & (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 99 (quoted supra) is clearly attracted. The High Court did not issue any notice to any person found and named in its judgment as having committed corrupt practice. I.A. No. 3 of 2000 has been filed by Shri Basudeb Bag, Superintendent of Police, Bankura, West Bengal and I.A. No. 4 of 2000 has been filed by Shri Nilanjan Chatterjee presently Secretary, Women Development Undertaking, Department of Social Welfare, Government of West Bengal who was appointed as returning officer for the election in question by the Election Commission of India. Both the officers have sought for being impleaded as party-respondents or as intervenors in the appeal so as to lay challenge to the findings recorded and adverse remarks and observations made in the judgment under appeal which if not expunged may adversely affect service carriers of the applicants. Their grievance is that they were not joined as parties to the election petition, they had no opportunity of hearing as they were never put on notice by the High Court and they have been condemned unheard. Section 9? of the RPA provides for an order at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition being made by the High Court whereby (a) the election petition may be dismissed, (b) the election of all or any of the returned candidates may be declared to be void, (c) in addition to the preceding relief, the election petitioner or any other candidated may be declared to have been duly elected. Section 99 provides as under : ""99. Other orders to be made by the High Court-(l) At the time of making an order under Section 98 [the High Court] shall also make an order [(a) where any charge is make in the petition of any corrupt practice having been committed at the election, recording  Page 4 of 9 (i) a finding whether any corrupt practice has or has not been proved to have been committed at the election, and the nature of that corrupt practice; and (ii) the names of all persons, if any, who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt practice and the nature of that practice; and] (b) fixing the total amount of costs payable arid specify the persons by and to whom, costs shall be paid; Provided that [a person who is not a party to the petition shall not be named] in the order under sub-clause (ii) of clause (a) unless (a) he as been given notice to appear before [the High Court] and to show cause why he should not be so named; and (b) if he appears in pursuance of the notice, he has been given an opportunity of cross-examining any witness who has already been examined by [the High Court] and has given evidence against him, of calling evidence in his defence and of being heard. [(2) In this section and in Section 100, the expression ""agent"" has the same meaning as in Section 123.]"" The ambit and scope of Sections 98 and 99 of the Act was considered in Dr. Ramesh Yeshwant Prabhoo v. Prabhakar Kashinath Kunte & Ors. [1996] 1 SCC 130, wherein this court held: ""While deciding the election petition at the conclusion of the trial and making an order under Section 98 disposing of the election petition in one of the ways specified therein, the High Court under Section 99 is required to record the names of all persons guilty of any corrupt practice which has been proved at the trial. Proviso to sub-section (1) then prescribes that a person who is not a party to the petition shall not be so named unless the condition specified in the proviso is fulfilled. The requirement of the proviso is only in respect of a person who is not a party to the petition and is to be named so that he too has the same opportunity which was available to a party to the petition.......The opportunity which a party to the petition had at the trial to defend against the allegation of corrupt practice is to be given by such a notice to that person of defending himself if he was not already a party to the petition. In other words the notice has to be equated with a party to the petition for this purpose and is to be given the same opportunity which he would get if he was made a party to the petition."" (Para 49). Again in Manohar Joshi v. Nitin Bhaurao Patil & Anr., [1996] 1 SCC 169, this court laid down the procedure which should be followed by the High Courts while disposing of such an election petition pointing out the fatal effect, which non-compliance would have, on the judgment of the High Court declaring void an election of the returned candidate. It was held: ""Section 98 contemplates the making of an order thereunder in the decision of the High Court rendered ""at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition""......There is nothing in Section 98 to permit the High Court to decide the election petition piecemeal and to declare the election of any returned candidated to be void at an intermediate stage of the trial when any part of the trial remains to be concluded, (Para 54) Sub-section (1) of Section 99 begins with the words ""At the time of making an order under Section 98 the High Court shall also make an order"" of the kind mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) therein......There can be no doubt that the order which can be made under sub-section (1) of Section 99 has, therefore, to be made only at the conclusion of the trial of an election  Page 5 of 9 petition in the decision of the High Court made by an order disposing of the election petition in one of the modes prescribed in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 98. This alone is sufficient to indicate that the requirement of Section 99 is to be completed during the trial of the election petition and the final order under Section 99 has to be made in the decision of the High Court rendered under Section 98 at the conclusion of the trial of the election petition. (Para 55) The High Court cannot make an order under Section 98 recording a finding of proof of corrupt practice against the returned candidate alone and on that basis declare the election of the returned candidate to be void and then proceed to comply with the requirement of Section 99 in the manner stated therein with a view to decide at a later stage whether any other person also is guilty of that corrupt practice for the purpose of naming him then under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. The High Court has no option in the matter to decide whether it will proceed under Section 99 against other persons alleged to be guilty of that corrupt practice along with the returned candidate inasmuch as the requirement of Section 99 is mandatory since the finding recorded by the High Court requires it to name all persons proved at the trial to have been guilty of the corrupt practice. The expression ""the names of all persons, if any, who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt practice"" in sub-clause (i) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 99 clearly provides for such proof being required ""at the trial"" which means ""the trial of an election petition"" mentioned in Section 98, at the conclusion of which alone the order contemplated under Section 98 can be made. (Para 57). Therefore, the election of the appellant in the present case could not be declared void by making an order under Section 98 on the ground contained in Section 100(1)(b) of the R.P. Act without prior compliance of Section 99. Absence of notice under Section 99 of the R.P. Act vitiates the final order made under Section 98 by the High Court declaring the election to be void."" (Para 60) [Emphasis supplied] In Chandrakanta Goyal v. Sohan Singh Jodh Sing Kohil, [1996] 1 SCC 378, this court again emphasised the procedure to be followed by the Supreme Court when non-compliance by the High Court with Section 99 was brought to its notice in appeal, in these words: ""Ordinarily in such a situation after setting aside the impugned judgment the matter is to be remitted to the High Court for deciding the election petition afresh after complying with the requirements of Section 99 of the Act by giving notice to the makers of the speeches and holding the requisite enquiry."" the same view has been reiterated in Moreshwar Save v. Dwarkadas Yashwantrao Pathrikar, [1996] 1 SCC 394, wherein this court has pointed but an alternative to be followed by the Supreme Court avoiding the necessity to remand by deferring the decision in appeal and in the meantime issuing notice under Section 99 to those persons and after the requisite enquiry by the High Court, its finding in respect of those persons being called for, deciding the case against the candidate and the notices at one time while deciding the appeal in the Supreme Court and then opined that in the case such second course did not appear to be appropriate one. All the decisions of this Court referred to hereinbefore are 3 judges Bench decisions. A2-judges Bench has also taken the same view in Dr. Vimal (Mrs.) v. Bhaguji & Ors., [1996] 9 SCC 351. We too are of the opinion that the fatal defect as noticed by us in the present case vitiates the judgment under appeal and in appropriate course in the facts and circumstances of the case would be to set aside the judgment under appeal and remand the case to the High Court for deciding the election petition afresh after compliance with the provisions of Section 99 of R.P. Act. In view of the above said remand, I.A. Nos. 3 and 4  Page 6 of 9 are rendered redundant. The applicants in the two applications seeking intervention before us shall obviously be now noticed by the High Court and they would have a right of hearing in accordance with Section 99 of the RPA before the High Court. Accordingly the appeal is allowed. The judgment under appeal is set aside. The election petition is remanded to the High Court for deciding afresh after compliance with Section 99 of the RPA and in accordance with law, No order as to costs in this appeal. With the inevitable remand in the terms as above said, the exercise of appellate jurisdiction of ours under Section 116-A of the RPA comes to an end. There are a few aspects of the case which have caused us concern and before parting with the case we would like to place on record our views in that regard. The manner in which the election petition has been tried defeats the very purpose of entrusting jurisdiction to try an election petition to the High Court by Representation of People (Amendment) Act, 1966, Out of several, we propose to deal with only two aspects: (i) framing of issues, and (ii) recording of evidence. In para 11, sub-paragraphs (a) to (q) (in all 17 sub-paragraphs) of the election petition there are about 11 corrupt practices, all of serious nature, alleged by the petitioner. On all these corrupt practices, one sweeping issue was framed issue- No.2, reproduced in the earlier part of this judgment. So is the case with regard to the incidents alleged in sub paragraphs (i) to (xii) of para 27 of the election petition whereon the petitioner sought to build up a case of corrupt practice having been committed by the appellant by obtaining or procuring or abetting or attempting to obtain or procure the Services from the Gazetted officer and persons in the service of Government in committing corrupt practice by improper reception of invalid votes and, refusal or rejection of valid votes materially affecting the result of election. As regards various instances of corrupt practice as alleged in these sub-paragraphs also an omnibus issue no.3, has been framed. An election petition is like a civil trial. The stage of framing the issues is an important one inasmuch as oh that day the scope of the trial is determined by laying the path on which the trial shall proceed excluding diversions and departures therefrom. The date fixed for settlement of issues is, therefore, a date fixed for hearing. The real dispute between the parties is determined, the area of conflict is narrowed and the concave mirror held by the court reflecting the pleadings of the parties pinpoints into issues the disputes on which the ’two sides differ. The correct decision of civil lis largely depends on correct framing of issues, correctly determining the real points in controversy which need to be decided. The scheme of order XIV of the Code of Civil Procedure dealing with settlement of issues shows that an issue arises when a material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by one party and denied by the other. Each material proposition affirmed by one party and denied by o(her should form the subject of distinct issue. An obligation is cast on the court to read the plaint/petition and the written statement/counter, if any, and then determine with the assistance of the learned counsel for the parties, the material propositions of fact or of law on which the parties are at variance. The issues shall be framed and recorded on which the decision of the case shall depend. The parties and their counsel are bound to assist the court in the process of framing of issues. Duty of the counsel does not belittle the primary obligation cast on the court. It is for the Presiding Judge to exert himself so as to frame sufficiently expressive issues. An omission to frame proper issues may be a ground for remanding the case for retrial subject to prejudice having been shown to have resulted by the omission. The petition may be disposed of at the first hearing if it appears that the parties are not at issue on any material question of law or of fact and the court may at once pronounce the judgment. If the parties are at issue on some questions of law or of fact, the suit or petition shall be fixed for trial calling upon the parties to  Page 7 of 9 adduce evidence on issues of fact. The evidence shall be confined to issues and the pleadings. No evidence on controversies not covered by issues and the pleadings, shall normally be admitted, for each party leads evidence in support of issues the burden of proving which lies on him. The object of an issue is to tie down the evidence and arguments and decision to a particular question so that there may be no doubt on what the dispute is. The judgment, then proceeding issue-wise would be able to tell precisely how the dispute was decided. In the case at hand, each one of the corrupt practices alleged by the petitioner and denied by the defendant, should have formed the subject matter of a distinct issue sufficiently expressive of the material proposition of fact and of law arising from the pleadings. Failure to do so has resulted in an utter confusion prevailing throughout the trial and also in the judgment of the High Court as was demonstrated by the learned counsel for the appellant during the hearing of the appeal attacking the findings arrived at by High Court. On some of the points in dispute the High Court has observed that no proof of the said fact (alleged in the petition) was necessary so far as the petitioner is concerned because there was no specific denial Of the allegations made or as there was no answer by the defendant to the allegations of the petitioner on points of substance. The contradiction with which the trial and the judgment suffer is writ large. If a material proposition of fact or law alleged in the petition was not denied or was hot specifically denied in the written statement within the meaning of Rule 5 of order 8 of C.P.C. and such tenor of the written statement had persuaded the learned designated Election Judge in forming an opinion (belatedly while writing the judgment) that there was an admission by necessary implication for want of denial or specific denial then there was no need of framing an issue and there was no need for recording of evidence on those issues. Valuable time of the court would have been saved from being wasted in recording evidence on such averments in pleadings as were not in issue for want of traverse, if it was so! However, in the facts of the present case, we are of the opinion that the defective framing of the issues though material, has not vitiated the trial inasmuch as we are satisfied that the parties have gone to the trial with full knowledge of the allegations and counter allegations made in the pleadings. None of the parties has complained of prejudice. None had made a prayer to the High Court, before going for trial, for amending or striking down any of the issues. We need say no more about the issues. Now as the recording of evidence. During the hearing of appeal the learned counsel for the parties took us through several statements of witnesses and read out many a passages while assailing for supporting the findings arrived at by the learned Designated Election Judge. A few aspects as to the examination of the witnesses and the manner of recording statements need to be adverted to. The record of evidence shows: 1. The statements of the witnesses are recorded hot in narrative but in question-answer form. During the course of hearing in appeal we asked the learned counsel for the parties about this feature. We were told that such is the practice prevalent on the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court. 2. The witnesses are named but not numbered. 3. Some of the witnesses are asked a few preliminary questions the relevance whereof we have not been able to appreciate. Many a witness has been asked whether he has appearing in the Court on sub-poena and then asked to produce the sub-poena in the Court for perusal of the presiding judge. 4. A host of such questions have been asked, both in examination-in-chief and in cross-examination, as are not permitted by the provisions of the Evidence Act. To wit, witnesses (other than the parties) have been confronted With the contents of the election petition or the written  Page 8 of 9 statement and asked to make comments or offer explanation as to passages therefrom, overlooking that Section 145 of the Evidence Act permits a witness being cross-examinded as to previous statement made by him and not by a third person. How can a witness be confronted or asked to explain the contents of or averments made in writing or document to which he is not a party? Same or similar questions have been allowed to be asked again and again. At places the witnesses have been ’grilled’ and compelled to answer embarrassing questions. The statements of 18 witnesses examined by the parties have been placed before us in 18 volumes some of which run into about a hundred or even hundreds of pages each. We are told that 120 days were consumed in recording the evidence. The learned counsel were agreeable that if only the conducting of examination -in-chief and cross-examination would have been effectively controlled, the recording of evidence could have been concluded in less than half of the time what has been consumed and the bulk of the evidence could have been reduced to one-third or one-fourth of what it is. The reason behind giving such a long rope in examining and cross examining the witnesses, surprisingly enough what we were told is that in the trial of an election petition, the atmosphere is surcharged, conducting counsel get over-zealous and it is not considered advisable by the Court to interrupt the conducting of examination and cross-examination of the witnesses by the counsel. We are not amused at all, Curtailing delays is essential to expeditious disposal of the case. Speedy disposal is the cry of the day. Courts cannot act as silent spectators when evidence is being recorded. Judges must have full control over the file and effectively conduct proceedings keeping in view that no litigant has any such right as to waste the precious time of the court. In almost all the courts in the country holding trials in civil and criminal cases, the oral examination of the witnesses though conducted in question-answer form by the counsel, is generally recorded in narrative by the presiding judges. The court has power to regulate the manner of recording evidence. In spite of the manner of recording evidence being in narrative the presiding judge can wherever necessary direct a particular question or group of questions to be recorded in question-answer form. Wherever necessary a note as to demeanour of a witness can always be made by the presiding judge before whom the witness is being examined and such note on demeanour made in the presence of the witness and counsel for both the parties would be more useful to the trial court itself while hearing arguments of the counsel for the parties at the end of the trial and also for the appellate court rather than a mere record of the statement in question-answer form. Incidentally and interestingly, it may be noticed that when the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was enacted, repealing the 1898 Code, Section 276 was introduced providing for evidence to be ordinarily taken down in the form of question and answer but vesting a discretion in the presiding judge to record the evidence in the form of a narrative. Within three years the Law Commission of the India found this system causing delay in trial and hence not workable and on its recommendation, by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act (45 of 1978), Section 276 was amended so as to provide that in trial before courts of session evidence shall ordinarily be taken down in the form of a narrative but the presiding judge may in his discretion taken down or cause to be taken down any part of such evidence in the form of question and answer. Thus recording of evidence in narrative form is the rule. Such mode of recording evidence is statutorily provided for session trials where life and liberty of persons is at stake. We fail to understand why the recording of evidence in narrative cannot be a mode to be followed in the trial of election petitions. Assigning serial numbers to the witnesses on their depositions such as PW1 (and so on) for petitioners’ witnesses and RW1 and DW1 (and so on) for the respondents’ or defendants’ witnesses would provide a convenient mode of referring to the witnesses during the course of hearing and while writing the judgment. We hope Calcutta High Court would consider suitably amending its rules or practice as applicable to Original Side and/or to trial of election petitions.  Page 9 of 9 It is not necessary to ask each witness whether he is appearing on subpoena and to have the sub-poena produced for the perusal of the Court. Whether a witness is on sub-poena or not is a matter of record known to the parties, the court and the witness. If a doubt or dispute may arise reference can be had to the record. Such questions, asked in routine, add only to the length of the deposition and are avoidable. An election petition is not a dispute between the petitioner and respondent merely; the fate of the constituency is on trial. A Judge presiding over the trial of an election petition, and any trial for the matter of that, needs to effectively control examination, cross-examination and re examination of the witnesses so as to exclude such questions being put to the witnesses as the law does not permit and to relieve the witnesses from the need of answering such questions which they are not bound to answer. Power to disallow questions should be effectively exercised by reference to Sections 146, 148, 150, 151 and 152 of the Evidence Act by excluding improper and impermissible questions. The examination of the witnesses should not be protracted and the witness should not feel harassed. The cross examiner must not be allowed to bully or take unfair advantage of the witness. Though the trials in India are adversarial, the power vesting in the court to ask any question to a witness at any time in the interest of justice gives the trial a little touch of its being inquisitorial. Witnesses attend the court to discharge the sacred duty of rendering aid to justice. They are entitled to be treated with respect and it is the judge who has to see that they feel confident in the court. In Ram Chander v. State of Haryana, AIR (1981) SC 1036 this Court observed, "".........to be an effective instrument in dispensing justice, the presiding judge must cease to be a spectator and a mere recording machine. He must become a participant in the trial by evincing intelligent active interest................"". An alert judge actively participating in court proceedings with a firm grip on oars enables the trial smoothly negotiating on shorter routes avoiding prolixity and expeditiously attaining the destination of just decision. The interest of the counsel for the parties in conducting the trial in such a way as to gain success for their respective clients is understandable but the obligation of the presiding judge to hold the proceedings so as to achieve the dual objective - search for truth and delivering justice expeditiously-cannot be subdued. Howsoever sensitive the subject matter of trial may be; the court room is no place of play for passions, emotions and surcharged enthusiasm","2001 (1) SCR 17 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by R.C. LAHOTI, J. This appeal under Section 116-A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (hereinafter ’the RPA’, for short) has been preferred by a candidate who won at the election but has lost in the election petition. Elections for the legislative seat of No. 216, Sabang Legislative Assembly Constituency in the district of Midnapore, West Bengal were held in May, 1996. There were four candidates in the fray. The appellant secured 60453 votes. The respondent no. 1 secured 59628 votes. The other two candidates received 594 and 453 votes respectively. On 12.5.1996 the appellant was declared elected by a margin of 825 votes over his nearest rival, the respondent no. .1. On 17.6.1996, the respondent no.l filed an election petition laying challenge to the election of the appellant and seeking a declaration that the result of the election was void. A declaration that the respondent no. 1 was duly elected was also sought for. On trial the High Court has allowed the election petition and set aside the election of the appellant declaring the same to be void. No other direction has been made. The appellant and two other candidates who had contested the election were only arrayed as the respondents in the election petition filed before the High Court. ISSUES It is not necessary to set out the pleadings, evidence and other details of the case in view of our having formed an opinion that the judgment under appeal suffers from a serious lacuna going to the root of the matter and therefore deserves to be set aside followed by a remand to the High Court with a direction to Comply with the provisions of Section 99 of the RPA and thereafter decide the election petition afresh. The fact insofar as necessary to demonstrate the need for remand are stated in brief hereinafter. The principal ground on which the election of the appellant was sought to be set aside was that the result of the election, insofar as it concerns the returned candidate was materially affected by corrupt practices committed in the interests of the returned candidate by the agent other than his election agent within the meaning of Section 100(l)(d) (ii) of the RPA. The election petition alleged commission of corrupt practices as defined in sub-sections (2) (4) and (7) of Section 123 of the RPA. For the purpose of this appeal it would suffice to note the issues framed by the High Court, the answers given and the findings recorded by the High Court. (1) Is the election petition maintainable in the present form?   of 9 (2) Is the respondent no.l, his election agent and/or his election agent is/are guilty of corrupt practices as alleged in paragraph 11 and sub paragraphs thereunder of the election petition? (3) Is the respondent no. 1, his election agents, the Returning Officer, Assistant returning Officer, counting Supervisors, counting Assistants acting as agent of the respondent no. 1 resorted to corrupt practices as alleged in paragraph 27 and sub-paragraphs thereunder of the said election petition? (4) Is the election petitioner entitled to a declaration that the election of the respondent no.l from the said 216, Sabang Legislative Assembly Constituency void? (5) Was the Returning Officer of the said Assembly Constituency biased in favour of the respondent no. 1? (6) Is the election petitioner entitled to a declaration that the petitioner had been duly elected to the said constituency having received majority of valid votes? (7) Is the election petitioner entitled to recounting of votes under the supervision of this court as prayed for in the petition? (8) What relief, if any, the election petitioner is entitled to? Findings ""Issues settled are answered in the manner following:-Issue No.-1 The election petition is maintainable. Issue No. 2-The respondent no.l, election agent and agents are guilty of corrupt practices. Issue No. 3-The respondent no. l, the Returning Officer, the Assistant Returning Officer, the Counting Supervisor, Counting Assistant acting as agent of the respondent no. l and resorted to corrupt practices. I am not, however, inclined to declare the petitioner as elected or secured majority of votes. There is no question of recounting in the instant case inasmuch as the election is vitiated by corrupt practices since the election is declared void. So far Issue Nos. 2 and 3 are concerned, they are decided in the affirmative. I am of the view that the petitioner cannot be declared as elected. For all the aforesaid reasons, in view, it is proved that corrupt practices had been committed under Section 123(2), 123(4) and 123(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by the returned candidate and/or his agents and the election of 216 Sabang Legislative Assembly constituency declaring the respondent no. 1 should be declared void. (Sic) Considering all aspects of the matter I am of the view that corrupt practice under Section 123(2), 123(4) and 123(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by the respondent no. 1 and/or his agents has been proved in this case. Accordingly it is declared that the election of the respondent no. 1 being the returned candidate from 216-Sabang Legislative Assembly constituency is void."" In addition to the findings arrived at (extracted and reproduced as hereinabove from the operative part of the judgment of the High Court), a few other findings from the body of the judgment, not all but only a few by  Page 3 of 9 way of illustration, are extracted and reproduced, so as to demonstrate how, in the light of its own findings, the High Court has failed in discharging its statutory obligation cast by Section 99 of the RPA resulting in vitiating the judgment. Those findings are; "".....it can be safely concluded from a careful reading of the written statement that (a) Hem Bhattacharya, Dipak Sarkar, Debasis Bose, Nilanjan Chatterjee, Returning officer, Aniandya kar, Block Development Officer and Assistant Returning Officer, Kushal Mitra, Officer -in-charge of Sabang Police Station, Pradip Das, Joint BDO, Sabang, Hare Krishna Jana, Sabhapati, Sabang Panchayat Samity; Chitta Bera, election agent of respondent no.) and Basudep Bag. Addl. S.P. Burdwan, all acted as agents of respondent no.1 being the part of the election machinery of CPI(M). It is further proved by admission that the political machinery of CPI(M) actively engaged itself not only to propagate for the respondent no.1 but also ensured win of the respondent no. 1 by commission of several corrupt practices mentioned in the petition as agent of respondent no. 1."" xxx xxx xxx It is clearly established from his evidence and also from several exhibits that the machinery of the GPI(M) its nuemerous workers, cadres activists and supporters were all working for respondent no.l as his agents and that the said corrupt practices committed by CPI(M) workers and leaders are no more than the works of the agent of respondent no. 1 and for each such corrupt practice and/or act of the agents of respondent no. 1 and as such the respondent no.1 is vicariously liable and is guilty of corrupt practices."" Thus, the high Court has clearly recorded a finding of corrupt practices having been committed at the election. The names of person who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of commission of the alleged corrupt practices and the nature of such practices has also been recorded. The applicability of sub-clauses (i) & (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 99 (quoted supra) is clearly attracted. The High Court did not issue any notice to any person found and named in its judgment as having committed corrupt practice. I.A. No. 3 of 2000 has been filed by Shri Basudeb Bag, Superintendent of Police, Bankura, West Bengal and I.A. No. 4 of 2000 has been filed by Shri Nilanjan Chatterjee presently Secretary, Women Development Undertaking, Department of Social Welfare, Government of West Bengal who was appointed as returning officer for the election in question by the Election Commission of India. Both the officers have sought for being impleaded as party-respondents or as intervenors in the appeal so as to lay challenge to the findings recorded and adverse remarks and observations made in the judgment under appeal which if not expunged may adversely affect service carriers of the applicants. Their grievance is that they were not joined as parties to the election petition, they had no opportunity of hearing as they were never put on notice by the High Court and they have been condemned unheard. Section 9? of the RPA provides for an order at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition being made by the High Court whereby (a) the election petition may be dismissed, (b) the election of all or any of the returned candidates may be declared to be void, (c) in addition to the preceding relief, the election petitioner or any other candidated may be declared to have been duly elected. Section 99 provides as under : ""99. Other orders to be made by the High Court-(l) At the time of making an order under Section 98 [the High Court] shall also make an order [(a) where any charge is make in the petition of any corrupt practice having been committed at the election, recording  Page 4 of 9 (i) a finding whether any corrupt practice has or has not been proved to have been committed at the election, and the nature of that corrupt practice; and (ii) the names of all persons, if any, who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt practice and the nature of that practice; and] (b) fixing the total amount of costs payable arid specify the persons by and to whom, costs shall be paid; Provided that [a person who is not a party to the petition shall not be named] in the order under sub-clause (ii) of clause (a) unless (a) he as been given notice to appear before [the High Court] and to show cause why he should not be so named; and (b) if he appears in pursuance of the notice, he has been given an opportunity of cross-examining any witness who has already been examined by [the High Court] and has given evidence against him, of calling evidence in his defence and of being heard. [(2) In this section and in Section 100, the expression ""agent"" has the same meaning as in Section 123.]"" The ambit and scope of Sections 98 and 99 of the Act was considered in Dr. Ramesh Yeshwant Prabhoo v. Prabhakar Kashinath Kunte & Ors. [1996] 1 SCC 130, wherein this court held: ""While deciding the election petition at the conclusion of the trial and making an order under Section 98 disposing of the election petition in one of the ways specified therein, the High Court under Section 99 is required to record the names of all persons guilty of any corrupt practice which has been proved at the trial. Proviso to sub-section (1) then prescribes that a person who is not a party to the petition shall not be so named unless the condition specified in the proviso is fulfilled. The requirement of the proviso is only in respect of a person who is not a party to the petition and is to be named so that he too has the same opportunity which was available to a party to the petition.......The opportunity which a party to the petition had at the trial to defend against the allegation of corrupt practice is to be given by such a notice to that person of defending himself if he was not already a party to the petition. In other words the notice has to be equated with a party to the petition for this purpose and is to be given the same opportunity which he would get if he was made a party to the petition."" (Para 49). Again in Manohar Joshi v. Nitin Bhaurao Patil & Anr., [1996] 1 SCC 169, this court laid down the procedure which should be followed by the High Courts while disposing of such an election petition pointing out the fatal effect, which non-compliance would have, on the judgment of the High Court declaring void an election of the returned candidate. It was held: ""Section 98 contemplates the making of an order thereunder in the decision of the High Court rendered ""at the conclusion of the trial of an election petition""......There is nothing in Section 98 to permit the High Court to decide the election petition piecemeal and to declare the election of any returned candidated to be void at an intermediate stage of the trial when any part of the trial remains to be concluded, (Para 54) Sub-section (1) of Section 99 begins with the words ""At the time of making an order under Section 98 the High Court shall also make an order"" of the kind mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) therein......There can be no doubt that the order which can be made under sub-section (1) of Section 99 has, therefore, to be made only at the conclusion of the trial of an election  Page 5 of 9 petition in the decision of the High Court made by an order disposing of the election petition in one of the modes prescribed in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 98. This alone is sufficient to indicate that the requirement of Section 99 is to be completed during the trial of the election petition and the final order under Section 99 has to be made in the decision of the High Court rendered under Section 98 at the conclusion of the trial of the election petition. (Para 55) The High Court cannot make an order under Section 98 recording a finding of proof of corrupt practice against the returned candidate alone and on that basis declare the election of the returned candidate to be void and then proceed to comply with the requirement of Section 99 in the manner stated therein with a view to decide at a later stage whether any other person also is guilty of that corrupt practice for the purpose of naming him then under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. The High Court has no option in the matter to decide whether it will proceed under Section 99 against other persons alleged to be guilty of that corrupt practice along with the returned candidate inasmuch as the requirement of Section 99 is mandatory since the finding recorded by the High Court requires it to name all persons proved at the trial to have been guilty of the corrupt practice. The expression ""the names of all persons, if any, who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt practice"" in sub-clause (i) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 99 clearly provides for such proof being required ""at the trial"" which means ""the trial of an election petition"" mentioned in Section 98, at the conclusion of which alone the order contemplated under Section 98 can be made. (Para 57). Therefore, the election of the appellant in the present case could not be declared void by making an order under Section 98 on the ground contained in Section 100(1)(b) of the R.P. Act without prior compliance of Section 99. Absence of notice under Section 99 of the R.P. Act vitiates the final order made under Section 98 by the High Court declaring the election to be void."" (Para 60) [Emphasis supplied] In Chandrakanta Goyal v. Sohan Singh Jodh Sing Kohil, [1996] 1 SCC 378, this court again emphasised the procedure to be followed by the Supreme Court when non-compliance by the High Court with Section 99 was brought to its notice in appeal, in these words: ""Ordinarily in such a situation after setting aside the impugned judgment the matter is to be remitted to the High Court for deciding the election petition afresh after complying with the requirements of Section 99 of the Act by giving notice to the makers of the speeches and holding the requisite enquiry."" the same view has been reiterated in Moreshwar Save v. Dwarkadas Yashwantrao Pathrikar, [1996] 1 SCC 394, wherein this court has pointed but an alternative to be followed by the Supreme Court avoiding the necessity to remand by deferring the decision in appeal and in the meantime issuing notice under Section 99 to those persons and after the requisite enquiry by the High Court, its finding in respect of those persons being called for, deciding the case against the candidate and the notices at one time while deciding the appeal in the Supreme Court and then opined that in the case such second course did not appear to be appropriate one. All the decisions of this Court referred to hereinbefore are 3 judges Bench decisions. A2-judges Bench has also taken the same view in Dr. Vimal (Mrs.) v. Bhaguji & Ors., [1996] 9 SCC 351. We too are of the opinion that the fatal defect as noticed by us in the present case vitiates the judgment under appeal and in appropriate course in the facts and circumstances of the case would be to set aside the judgment under appeal and remand the case to the High Court for deciding the election petition afresh after compliance with the provisions of Section 99 of R.P. Act. In view of the above said remand, I.A. Nos. 3 and 4  Page 6 of 9 are rendered redundant. The applicants in the two applications seeking intervention before us shall obviously be now noticed by the High Court and they would have a right of hearing in accordance with Section 99 of the RPA before the High Court. Accordingly the appeal is allowed. The judgment under appeal is set aside. The election petition is remanded to the High Court for deciding afresh after compliance with Section 99 of the RPA and in accordance with law, No order as to costs in this appeal. With the inevitable remand in the terms as above said, the exercise of appellate jurisdiction of ours under Section 116-A of the RPA comes to an end. There are a few aspects of the case which have caused us concern and before parting with the case we would like to place on record our views in that regard. The manner in which the election petition has been tried defeats the very purpose of entrusting jurisdiction to try an election petition to the High Court by Representation of People (Amendment) Act, 1966, Out of several, we propose to deal with only two aspects: (i) framing of issues, and (ii) recording of evidence. In para 11, sub-paragraphs (a) to (q) (in all 17 sub-paragraphs) of the election petition there are about 11 corrupt practices, all of serious nature, alleged by the petitioner. On all these corrupt practices, one sweeping issue was framed issue- No.2, reproduced in the earlier part of this judgment. So is the case with regard to the incidents alleged in sub paragraphs (i) to (xii) of para 27 of the election petition whereon the petitioner sought to build up a case of corrupt practice having been committed by the appellant by obtaining or procuring or abetting or attempting to obtain or procure the Services from the Gazetted officer and persons in the service of Government in committing corrupt practice by improper reception of invalid votes and, refusal or rejection of valid votes materially affecting the result of election. As regards various instances of corrupt practice as alleged in these sub-paragraphs also an omnibus issue no.3, has been framed. An election petition is like a civil trial. The stage of framing the issues is an important one inasmuch as oh that day the scope of the trial is determined by laying the path on which the trial shall proceed excluding diversions and departures therefrom. The date fixed for settlement of issues is, therefore, a date fixed for hearing. The real dispute between the parties is determined, the area of conflict is narrowed and the concave mirror held by the court reflecting the pleadings of the parties pinpoints into issues the disputes on which the ’two sides differ. The correct decision of civil lis largely depends on correct framing of issues, correctly determining the real points in controversy which need to be decided. The scheme of order XIV of the Code of Civil Procedure dealing with settlement of issues shows that an issue arises when a material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by one party and denied by the other. Each material proposition affirmed by one party and denied by o(her should form the subject of distinct issue. An obligation is cast on the court to read the plaint/petition and the written statement/counter, if any, and then determine with the assistance of the learned counsel for the parties, the material propositions of fact or of law on which the parties are at variance. The issues shall be framed and recorded on which the decision of the case shall depend. The parties and their counsel are bound to assist the court in the process of framing of issues. Duty of the counsel does not belittle the primary obligation cast on the court. It is for the Presiding Judge to exert himself so as to frame sufficiently expressive issues. An omission to frame proper issues may be a ground for remanding the case for retrial subject to prejudice having been shown to have resulted by the omission. The petition may be disposed of at the first hearing if it appears that the parties are not at issue on any material question of law or of fact and the court may at once pronounce the judgment. If the parties are at issue on some questions of law or of fact, the suit or petition shall be fixed for trial calling upon the parties to  Page 7 of 9 adduce evidence on issues of fact. The evidence shall be confined to issues and the pleadings. No evidence on controversies not covered by issues and the pleadings, shall normally be admitted, for each party leads evidence in support of issues the burden of proving which lies on him. The object of an issue is to tie down the evidence and arguments and decision to a particular question so that there may be no doubt on what the dispute is. The judgment, then proceeding issue-wise would be able to tell precisely how the dispute was decided. In the case at hand, each one of the corrupt practices alleged by the petitioner and denied by the defendant, should have formed the subject matter of a distinct issue sufficiently expressive of the material proposition of fact and of law arising from the pleadings. Failure to do so has resulted in an utter confusion prevailing throughout the trial and also in the judgment of the High Court as was demonstrated by the learned counsel for the appellant during the hearing of the appeal attacking the findings arrived at by High Court. On some of the points in dispute the High Court has observed that no proof of the said fact (alleged in the petition) was necessary so far as the petitioner is concerned because there was no specific denial Of the allegations made or as there was no answer by the defendant to the allegations of the petitioner on points of substance. The contradiction with which the trial and the judgment suffer is writ large. If a material proposition of fact or law alleged in the petition was not denied or was hot specifically denied in the written statement within the meaning of Rule 5 of order 8 of C.P.C. and such tenor of the written statement had persuaded the learned designated Election Judge in forming an opinion (belatedly while writing the judgment) that there was an admission by necessary implication for want of denial or specific denial then there was no need of framing an issue and there was no need for recording of evidence on those issues. Valuable time of the court would have been saved from being wasted in recording evidence on such averments in pleadings as were not in issue for want of traverse, if it was so! However, in the facts of the present case, we are of the opinion that the defective framing of the issues though material, has not vitiated the trial inasmuch as we are satisfied that the parties have gone to the trial with full knowledge of the allegations and counter allegations made in the pleadings. None of the parties has complained of prejudice. None had made a prayer to the High Court, before going for trial, for amending or striking down any of the issues. We need say no more about the issues. Now as the recording of evidence. During the hearing of appeal the learned counsel for the parties took us through several statements of witnesses and read out many a passages while assailing for supporting the findings arrived at by the learned Designated Election Judge. A few aspects as to the examination of the witnesses and the manner of recording statements need to be adverted to. The record of evidence shows: 1. The statements of the witnesses are recorded hot in narrative but in question-answer form. During the course of hearing in appeal we asked the learned counsel for the parties about this feature. We were told that such is the practice prevalent on the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court. 2. The witnesses are named but not numbered. 3. Some of the witnesses are asked a few preliminary questions the relevance whereof we have not been able to appreciate. Many a witness has been asked whether he has appearing in the Court on sub-poena and then asked to produce the sub-poena in the Court for perusal of the presiding judge. 4. A host of such questions have been asked, both in examination-in-chief and in cross-examination, as are not permitted by the provisions of the Evidence Act. To wit, witnesses (other than the parties) have been confronted With the contents of the election petition or the written  Page 8 of 9 statement and asked to make comments or offer explanation as to passages therefrom, overlooking that Section 145 of the Evidence Act permits a witness being cross-examinded as to previous statement made by him and not by a third person. How can a witness be confronted or asked to explain the contents of or averments made in writing or document to which he is not a party? Same or similar questions have been allowed to be asked again and again. At places the witnesses have been ’grilled’ and compelled to answer embarrassing questions. The statements of 18 witnesses examined by the parties have been placed before us in 18 volumes some of which run into about a hundred or even hundreds of pages each. We are told that 120 days were consumed in recording the evidence. The learned counsel were agreeable that if only the conducting of examination -in-chief and cross-examination would have been effectively controlled, the recording of evidence could have been concluded in less than half of the time what has been consumed and the bulk of the evidence could have been reduced to one-third or one-fourth of what it is. The reason behind giving such a long rope in examining and cross examining the witnesses, surprisingly enough what we were told is that in the trial of an election petition, the atmosphere is surcharged, conducting counsel get over-zealous and it is not considered advisable by the Court to interrupt the conducting of examination and cross-examination of the witnesses by the counsel. We are not amused at all, Curtailing delays is essential to expeditious disposal of the case. Speedy disposal is the cry of the day. Courts cannot act as silent spectators when evidence is being recorded. Judges must have full control over the file and effectively conduct proceedings keeping in view that no litigant has any such right as to waste the precious time of the court. In almost all the courts in the country holding trials in civil and criminal cases, the oral examination of the witnesses though conducted in question-answer form by the counsel, is generally recorded in narrative by the presiding judges. The court has power to regulate the manner of recording evidence. In spite of the manner of recording evidence being in narrative the presiding judge can wherever necessary direct a particular question or group of questions to be recorded in question-answer form. Wherever necessary a note as to demeanour of a witness can always be made by the presiding judge before whom the witness is being examined and such note on demeanour made in the presence of the witness and counsel for both the parties would be more useful to the trial court itself while hearing arguments of the counsel for the parties at the end of the trial and also for the appellate court rather than a mere record of the statement in question-answer form. Incidentally and interestingly, it may be noticed that when the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was enacted, repealing the 1898 Code, Section 276 was introduced providing for evidence to be ordinarily taken down in the form of question and answer but vesting a discretion in the presiding judge to record the evidence in the form of a narrative. Within three years the Law Commission of the India found this system causing delay in trial and hence not workable and on its recommendation, by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act (45 of 1978), Section 276 was amended so as to provide that in trial before courts of session evidence shall ordinarily be taken down in the form of a narrative but the presiding judge may in his discretion taken down or cause to be taken down any part of such evidence in the form of question and answer. Thus recording of evidence in narrative form is the rule. Such mode of recording evidence is statutorily provided for session trials where life and liberty of persons is at stake. We fail to understand why the recording of evidence in narrative cannot be a mode to be followed in the trial of election petitions. Assigning serial numbers to the witnesses on their depositions such as PW1 (and so on) for petitioners’ witnesses and RW1 and DW1 (and so on) for the respondents’ or defendants’ witnesses would provide a convenient mode of referring to the witnesses during the course of hearing and while writing the judgment. We hope Calcutta High Court would consider suitably amending its rules or practice as applicable to Original Side and/or to trial of election petitions.  Page 9 of 9 It is not necessary to ask each witness whether he is appearing on subpoena and to have the sub-poena produced for the perusal of the Court. Whether a witness is on sub-poena or not is a matter of record known to the parties, the court and the witness. If a doubt or dispute may arise reference can be had to the record. Such questions, asked in routine, add only to the length of the deposition and are avoidable. An election petition is not a dispute between the petitioner and respondent merely; the fate of the constituency is on trial. A Judge presiding over the trial of an election petition, and any trial for the matter of that, needs to effectively control examination, cross-examination and re examination of the witnesses so as to exclude such questions being put to the witnesses as the law does not permit and to relieve the witnesses from the need of answering such questions which they are not bound to answer. Power to disallow questions should be effectively exercised by reference to Sections 146, 148, 150, 151 and 152 of the Evidence Act by excluding improper and impermissible questions. The examination of the witnesses should not be protracted and the witness should not feel harassed. The cross examiner must not be allowed to bully or take unfair advantage of the witness. Though the trials in India are adversarial, the power vesting in the court to ask any question to a witness at any time in the interest of justice gives the trial a little touch of its being inquisitorial. Witnesses attend the court to discharge the sacred duty of rendering aid to justice. They are entitled to be treated with respect and it is the judge who has to see that they feel confident in the court. In Ram Chander v. State of Haryana, AIR (1981) SC 1036 this Court observed, "".........to be an effective instrument in dispensing justice, the presiding judge must cease to be a spectator and a mere recording machine. He must become a participant in the trial by evincing intelligent active interest................"". An alert judge actively participating in court proceedings with a firm grip on oars enables the trial smoothly negotiating on shorter routes avoiding prolixity and expeditiously attaining the destination of just decision. The interest of the counsel for the parties in conducting the trial in such a way as to gain success for their respective clients is understandable but the obligation of the presiding judge to hold the proceedings so as to achieve the dual objective - search for truth and delivering justice expeditiously-cannot be subdued. Howsoever sensitive the subject matter of trial may be; the court room is no place of play for passions, emotions and surcharged enthusiasm"
8,Appeal (civil) 5043 of 2001,Indian Red Cross Society,New Delhi Municipal Committee & Ors.,28/4/2003,Ruma Pal & B.N. Srikrishna.,"RUMA PAL, J. The appellant-Society is a charitable organisation. In 1930, it was granted a permanent lease of premises No. 1, Red Cross Road, New Delhi. Between 1975-77 the appellant constructed a building on the premises. The building consists of a basement, ground floor and five floors above the ground floor. A portion of the building is used by the appellant for the purposes of its Headquarters and its various offices which include a Blood Bank, St. John’s Ambulance Brigade, Maternity and Child Welfare Bureau and also the Hindkusht Nivaran Sangh. The balance portion of the building is rented out by the appellant. It is the appellant’s case that the rent is utilised wholly for charitable purposes. The appellant has claimed exemption from payment of house tax in respect of the building for the years 1977-78 to the present day. Prior to 1994, house tax in respect of properties in Delhi was imposed under the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911. The Punjab Act was repealed by the New Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994 (briefly the NDMC Act) as far as New Delhi is concerned with effect from the day that the respondent No. 1 Council was established under Section 3 read with Section 416(1) of the latter Act. According to the appellant, it had, till that time, paid some amounts of money towards the demands raised by the respondent No.1 on account of property tax and had also applied to the respondents for grant of exemption. According to the appellants, there was no response to the appellant’s representation. The appellant filed a Writ Petition before the High Court at Delhi specifically impugning two bills raised by the Municipal Corporation dated 20.7.90 and 31.5.91 which were for the sums of Rs.69,14,792.71 and Rs.6,13,492 respectively. Interim protection was given to the appellant No.1 by the High Court and the demands were stayed. The appellant then filed eight more writ petitions before the High Court questioning the subsequent demands on account of property tax raised by the respondent No. 1 in respect of the appellant’s building. The writ petitions were heard and disposed of by the High Court by directing the appellant to make a fresh representation to the Director (Tax) of the respondent No.1 who was required to consider and dispose of the same. Liberty was also granted to the appellant to re-agitate the grounds on which the writ petitions were filed in the event the decision of the Director (Tax) went against the appellant.   of 8 The appellant made a representation pursuant to the order of the High Court. This was disposed of on 26.2.2001 by the Assistant Secretary (Tax). The Assistant Secretary noted that he was examining the claim for exemption only for the period 1991-92 to 2000-2001. The position under the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 was examined and it was found that the appellant had filed an application claiming exemption under that Act only in respect of the self-occupied portion of the building. The Municipal Committee which was the competent authority under Section 70 of the Punjab Act had resolved to grant exemption from payment of property tax under the Punjab Act in respect of the self-occupied portion of the building. The resolution of the Committee was approved by the State Government. The exemption was granted upto the year 1990 91. The order also stated that there was no application for exemption by the appellant for 1991-92 to 1993-94 as such no resolutions had been taken by the Committee. The Assistant Secretary then considered Sections 60, 61 and 62 of the NDMC Act, 1994 and noted that exemption could be granted, if at all, under the provisions of the NDMC Act in respect of that portion of the building occupied by the appellant and used for charitable purposes. Although the Assistant Secretary was of the view that even the portion occupied by the appellant did not qualify for exemption as the premises were not used exclusively for charitable purposes, nevertheless as the Committee under the Punjab Act had given exemption to the self-occupied portion treating the same as used for charitable purposes, ""the same intention is allowed to continue"". With respect to the appellant’s claim for exemption in respect of the rented portion of the premises, the Assistant Secretary was of the view that it was not permissible under Section 62(2) of the NDMC Act. It was said that ""the user of the income from the building is wholly irrelevant for the purposes of grant to a building"". The claim of the society was rejected because it was said that to accede to the claim would have far reaching consequences. It was said that ""although the income may get exemption in income tax but in the Municipal Act, there is no such concept of granting exemption to the property just because that income is being utilised for charitable purposes"". Decisions of the Delhi High Court and of this Court were considered in coming to the conclusion that no exemption for the portion in occupation of the tenants is available as the portions were not used for charitable purposes. An apprehension was expressed that if the interpretation sought to be placed by the appellant-society were accepted, then any society could claim exemption on the ground that rental income would be used for charitable purposes. This, according to the Assistant Secretary, was not the intention of the legislature. Accordingly it was held that no exemption could be granted under Section 62(1)(a) read with Section 62(2) in respect of the portion of the building which had been rented out by the appellant. However, exemption was to be allowed for the self occupied portion if the appellant continued to be supported through voluntary contributions and did not generate surpluses year after year. On the basis of the statements made to this effect by the appellant, the Assistant Secretary granted exemption for the self-occupied portions for the period 1991-92 to 2000-2001. It was also stated that the society would have to claim exemption every year and satisfy the conditions required for exemption every year. The appellant then filed an application for reviving the writ petitions which had been disposed of earlier by the High Court. Although this application was allowed by the High Court, the writ petitions were dismissed with the observation that the appellant was at liberty to discharge its liability to the  Page 3 of 8 respondent No.1 by instalments. The appellant has preferred this appeal by way of a Special Leave Petition. The appellant relied on the decision of this Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Children Book Trust 1992 (3) SCC 390 to contend that since it is a charitable organisation and the entire building is used for charitable purposes, it is not liable to pay property tax under Section 62 of the NDMC Act, 1994 in respect of the entire building including the rented portion at all. In the alternative it has been submitted that if the appellant is liable to pay property tax, the power to grant exemption had not been properly exercised by the respondent No.1 under the provisions of Section 124 read with section 72 (e) of the NDMC Act. Learned counsel appearing for the respondents contended that Section 62 of the NDMC Act explicitly made buildings which were not self-occupied by a charitable organisation, subject to house tax. It was further submitted that the decision relied upon by the appellant was not applicable to the appellant’s case. As far as the alternative submission of the appellant is concerned, it is the respondents’ contention that there was no power under the NDMC Act to grant exemption in an individual case. Exemption could only be granted to a class of similarly situated bodies or persons. The appellant has in the meanwhile cleared all the outstanding demands of the respondent No. 1 and continued to apply for exemption from payment of property tax in respect of the entire building. Two of the applications dated 17th May 2001 and 20th August 2001 have been brought on record. An order passed by the Advisor (Revenue) of the NDMC dated 22nd March 2002 limited to the question of fixation of the rateable value of the rented portion for the purposes of house tax has also been brought on record. The order records that the self-occupied portion of the building has been exempted from payment of property tax. However, it is clear from the body of the order that it was not passed in response to the appellant’s application for grant of exemption to the appellant under the provisions either of the Punjab Act or the NDMC Act. Under the Punjab Act, the tax on all property was imposed under Section 61. The statute itself did not allow for any specific exemption in respect of any class of property and left it to the discretion of the Committee or the State Government to grant exemption in the circumstances prescribed. The ""Committee"" has been defined in Section 3(4) as the Municipal Council or a Nagar Panchayat, as the case may be, constituted under Section 12 of the Act. Section 70 of the Punjab Act provided for the ’Power of the Committee in regard to taxes’. Sub-section (2) of Section 70 provided: ""A Committee, by a resolution passed at a special meeting and confirmed by the State Government, may (a) provide that all or any persons may be allowed to compound for taxes imposed under sub-clauses (c), (d) and (e) of clause (1) and under clauses (2) and (3) of section 61: (b) abolish, suspend or reduce in amount any tax imposed under the foregoing sections; or (c) exempt in whole or in part from the payment of any such tax, any person or class of persons or any  Page 4 of 8 property or description of property."" Apart from the power of the Committee under the aforesaid provisions, the State Government was given power under Section 71 by order to : ""exempt in whole or in part from the payment of any such tax any person or class of persons or any property description of property. If at any time it appears to the State Government on complaint made or otherwise, that any tax imposed under the foregoing sections is unfair in its incidence or that the levy thereof or of any part thereof is injurious to the interests of the general public, it may require the committee to take within a specified period measures to remove the objection: and, if within that period the requirement is not complied with to the satisfaction of the State Government the State Government may by notification suspend the levy of the tax or of such part thereof until the objection has been removed."" As far as the NDMC Act is concerned, property tax is leviable on lands and buildings in New Delhi under Section 60(1)(a) read with Section 61(1). Section 62 which has been construed in the impugned order by the Assistant Secretary, is quoted: ""62(1) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the property tax shall be levied in respect of all lands and buildings in New Delhi except : (a) lands and buildings or portions of lands and buildings exclusively occupied and used for public worship or by a society or body for a charitable purpose: Provided that such society or body is supported wholly or in part by voluntary contributions, applies its profits, if any, or other income in promoting its objects and does not pay any dividend or bonus to its members. Explanation ’Charitable purpose’ includes relief of the poor, education and medical relief but does not include a purpose which relates exclusively to the religious teaching. (b) lands and buildings vested in the Council, in respect of which the said tax, if levied, would under the provisions of this Act be leviable primarily on the Council; (c) agricultural lands and buildings (other than dwelling houses).  Page 5 of 8 (2) Lands and buildings or portion thereof shall not be deemed to be exclusively occupied and used for public worship or for a charitable purpose within the meaning of clause (a) of sub-section (1) if any trade or business is carried on in such lands and buildings or portion thereof or if in respect of such lands and buildings or portions thereof, any rent is derived. (3) Where any portion of any land or building is exempt from the property tax by reason of its being exclusively occupied and used for public worship or for a charitable purpose such portion shall be deemed to be a separate property for the purpose of municipal taxation."" If one analyses the relevant clauses of Section 62(1), lands and buildings or portions of lands and buildings are exempt from property tax if they are: (i) exclusively occupied by a society or body for a charitable purpose; (ii) such society or body is supported wholly or in part by voluntary contributions; (iii) the said society applies its profits, if any or other income in promoting its objects and does not pay any dividend or bonus to its members, It is clear that under Section 62(1) of the NDMC Act, if the appellant-society fulfils these three conditions it is entitled as a matter of right to be exempted from payment of property tax. Where the Assistant Secretary erred, was in treating the right to exemption in respect of the self-occupied portions of the appellant’s building as a matter of discretion. It is not. It is a matter of right provided of course of the conditions laid down in Section 62(1) are fulfilled by the society. Sub-section (2) of Section 62, however, carves out two exceptions to this exemption, namely if (a) any trade is carried out in such lands and buildings, or (b) in respect of any portion of such land or building or portion thereof any rent is derived. In such a case, under sub-section (3), the portion of the land or building exclusively occupied and used for charitable purposes under Section 62(1) and the portion, which is excepted under sub-section (2) are deemed to be separate properties for the purpose of municipal taxation. Thus the statutory exemption under Section 62(1) is not available to the society if the building is not self-occupied but is rented out. The section does not make any allowance even if the rental income is used for charitable purposes. The phrase ’for a charitable purpose’ only qualifies self occupation under Section 62(1)(a). The appellant’s claim for the benefit of such statutory exemption under Section 62 of the Act in respect of the rented portion of the building is, therefore, untenable and the Assistant Secretary had rightly rejected it. The appellant’s reliance on the decision of this Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi V. Children Book Trust and Anr. ( supra) is misplaced although in that decision, this Court had construed Section 115(4) (5) and (6) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 which are verbatim the same as Sections 62(1), (2) and (3) of the NDMC Act. There the Court had disposed of two appeals. The first appeal was filed by the Corporation against the Children Book Trust and the second  Page 6 of 8 was by the Safdarjung Enclave Education Society against the Corporation. As far as the appeal filed by the Children Book Trust was concerned, a portion of the premises occupied by the Trust was rented out to a Press. The Municipal Corporation had sought to levy property tax under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 in respect of the entire premises. The Trust filed a writ petition claiming total exemption from payment of property tax under Section 115 (4) of the 1957 Act before the High Court at Delhi. The writ petition was allowed by the learned Single Judge who held that the Trust was entitled to claim total exemption from payment of tax under Section 115(4) of the 1957 Act except in respect of that portion which was rented out. However, the learned Judge held that even from the rental value, the Trust was entitled to claim exemption in the proportion of the income accruing to it from the publication of children’s book which was held to be a charitable purpose. The Division Bench partly allowed the Municipal Corporation’s appeal holding that in view of the mandatory provisions of Section 115(4) of the New Delhi Corporation Act, exemption from the payment of property tax could not be allowed in respect of the area which was rented out or not occupied by the Trust itself for charitable purposes within the meaning of the 1957 Act. The further appeal of the Municipal Corporation before this Court was dismissed. It is to be noted that the Court was only considering the Municipal Corporation’s appeal in respect of the portion of the premises which had not been rented out by the Trust. As far as the rented portion was concerned, the Court noted ""Admittedly, no exemption could be claimed concerning this portion. It is the other portions which are otherwise relevant for the purpose of this case"". In the appeal of the Education Society, the Education Society claimed an exemption in respect of premises owned by it where a school was being run. The Society had filed a writ petition challenging an assessment order of the Municipal Corporation. The writ petition was dismissed by the High Court. The Education Society then preferred an appeal before this Court. The contention which was raised before this Court was that the Society was running the school which was in occupation of the premises and that the giving of education was a charitable purpose and, therefore, the society was entitled to exemption under the provisions of Section 115(4) of the Act. This Court held that the Society could not be said to be occupying the building. ""The School being a separate entity, premises occupied by the school will belong to it and not to the society. Therefore, the society cannot claim to be in exclusive occupation and use of the land and building in question."" It was also held that although the imparting of education may be a charitable purpose, the Society would have to further show that education was the primary objective and not the making of profit. It was also held that unless the society was supported wholly or substantially by voluntary contributions, in view of the proviso to Section 115(4)(a), [Section 62(1)(a) of the NDMC Act] exemption from payment of property tax could not be claimed. None of these findings are relevant for our present purpose. There is no dispute that the appellant-Society before us exclusively occupies a portion of the premises for a charitable purpose and otherwise fulfils the conditions required for exemption from property tax in respect of such portion. We are, in this appeal, unlike in the appeals in the Children Book Trust, only concerned with the balance portion of the building which has been rented out by the appellant. It is true that this Court in Children Book Trust made an observation that: "".if the profits or income of trade or business is devoted to a charitable purpose and no part thereof is  Page 7 of 8 distributed among the members as dividends or bonus, then that trade or business is a means to an end. It is charity. But, if there is a trade or business carried on in a land or building and its profits are not applied to a charitable purpose, sub-section (6) says that that part of the land or building where a trade or business is carried on or from which rent is derived, will be subject to tax."" However, these observations were made in the context of Section 115(4) [Section 62(1) of the NDMC Act)] which envisages societies occupying the subject premises, making profit or deriving income. The proviso to sub-Section 4, clause (a) requires such profits or income to be utilised in promoting the objects of the society and not to be paid by way of dividend or bonus to the members of the society. It was in that connection that the Court made the observation quoted above. The observation would not be relevant to a situation where property is not in occupation of the Society at all but is rented out. Coming to the alternative case of the appellant viz., the grant of exemption in respect of the tax leviable on the rented portions, although, the Assistant Secretary did not have any other option but to consider the appellant’s claim for exemption in view of the direction of the High Court, no discretion is conferred under Section 62 of the NDMC Act on the Assistant Secretary for granting any exemption to the assessee from any portion of the taxes leviable except to the extent the statute itself provides. Section 72(1)(e) on which the appellant has relied provides: ""72(1) The chairperson may, at any time, amend the assessment list (e) by making or cancelling any entry exempting any land or building from liability to property tax; "" This section also does not confer any discretion on the Chairperson to exempt any property from payment of tax. All that it does is to empower the Chairperson to give effect to any exemption otherwise granted, by amending the Assessment List. The power and discretion to grant exemption under the NDMC Act has been conferred on the Council under Section 124. Section 124 provides: ""The Council may, by resolution passed in this behalf, exempt either wholly or in part from the payment of any tax levied under this Act, any class of persons or any class of property or goods."" The respondents are correct in their submission that under Section 124, as far as the present controversy is concerned, the Council’s power must be exercised, if at all, in favour of a class of persons or a class of property. This power may be contrasted with the Punjab Municipal Act where exemption may have been allowed, even in respect of an individual by the Committee under Section 70(2)(c) and the State Government under Section 71. Therefore, while dismissing the appellant’s appeal in so  Page 8 of 8 far as it has claimed statutory exemption under Section 62 in respect of the rented portion of the building, we grant the liberty to the appellant-Society to apply to the Council for exemption from payment of taxes leviable in respect of the rented portion. It would be open to the Council to resolve under the provisions of Section 124 to exempt all persons who are similarly situated as the appellant-society on the application of the appellant. The Council will dispose of the appellant’s representation after giving the appellants an opportunity of being heard. There will be no order as to costs","RUMA PAL, J. The appellant-Society is a charitable organisation. In 1930, it was granted a permanent lease of premises No. 1, Red Cross Road, New Delhi. Between 1975-77 the appellant constructed a building on the premises. The building consists of a basement, ground floor and five floors above the ground floor. A portion of the building is used by the appellant for the purposes of its Headquarters and its various offices which include a Blood Bank, St. John’s Ambulance Brigade, Maternity and Child Welfare Bureau and also the Hindkusht Nivaran Sangh. The balance portion of the building is rented out by the appellant. It is the appellant’s case that the rent is utilised wholly for charitable purposes. The appellant has claimed exemption from payment of house tax in respect of the building for the years 1977-78 to the present day. Prior to 1994, house tax in respect of properties in Delhi was imposed under the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911. The Punjab Act was repealed by the New Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994 (briefly the NDMC Act) as far as New Delhi is concerned with effect from the day that the respondent No. 1 Council was established under Section 3 read with Section 416(1) of the latter Act. According to the appellant, it had, till that time, paid some amounts of money towards the demands raised by the respondent No.1 on account of property tax and had also applied to the respondents for grant of exemption. According to the appellants, there was no response to the appellant’s representation. The appellant filed a Writ Petition before the High Court at Delhi specifically impugning two bills raised by the Municipal Corporation dated 20.7.90 and 31.5.91 which were for the sums of Rs.69,14,792.71 and Rs.6,13,492 respectively. Interim protection was given to the appellant No.1 by the High Court and the demands were stayed. The appellant then filed eight more writ petitions before the High Court questioning the subsequent demands on account of property tax raised by the respondent No. 1 in respect of the appellant’s building. The writ petitions were heard and disposed of by the High Court by directing the appellant to make a fresh representation to the Director (Tax) of the respondent No.1 who was required to consider and dispose of the same. Liberty was also granted to the appellant to re-agitate the grounds on which the writ petitions were filed in the event the decision of the Director (Tax) went against the appellant.   of 8 The appellant made a representation pursuant to the order of the High Court. This was disposed of on 26.2.2001 by the Assistant Secretary (Tax). The Assistant Secretary noted that he was examining the claim for exemption only for the period 1991-92 to 2000-2001. The position under the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 was examined and it was found that the appellant had filed an application claiming exemption under that Act only in respect of the self-occupied portion of the building. The Municipal Committee which was the competent authority under Section 70 of the Punjab Act had resolved to grant exemption from payment of property tax under the Punjab Act in respect of the self-occupied portion of the building. The resolution of the Committee was approved by the State Government. The exemption was granted upto the year 1990 91. The order also stated that there was no application for exemption by the appellant for 1991-92 to 1993-94 as such no resolutions had been taken by the Committee. The Assistant Secretary then considered Sections 60, 61 and 62 of the NDMC Act, 1994 and noted that exemption could be granted, if at all, under the provisions of the NDMC Act in respect of that portion of the building occupied by the appellant and used for charitable purposes. Although the Assistant Secretary was of the view that even the portion occupied by the appellant did not qualify for exemption as the premises were not used exclusively for charitable purposes, nevertheless as the Committee under the Punjab Act had given exemption to the self-occupied portion treating the same as used for charitable purposes, ""the same intention is allowed to continue"". With respect to the appellant’s claim for exemption in respect of the rented portion of the premises, the Assistant Secretary was of the view that it was not permissible under Section 62(2) of the NDMC Act. It was said that ""the user of the income from the building is wholly irrelevant for the purposes of grant to a building"". The claim of the society was rejected because it was said that to accede to the claim would have far reaching consequences. It was said that ""although the income may get exemption in income tax but in the Municipal Act, there is no such concept of granting exemption to the property just because that income is being utilised for charitable purposes"". Decisions of the Delhi High Court and of this Court were considered in coming to the conclusion that no exemption for the portion in occupation of the tenants is available as the portions were not used for charitable purposes. An apprehension was expressed that if the interpretation sought to be placed by the appellant-society were accepted, then any society could claim exemption on the ground that rental income would be used for charitable purposes. This, according to the Assistant Secretary, was not the intention of the legislature. Accordingly it was held that no exemption could be granted under Section 62(1)(a) read with Section 62(2) in respect of the portion of the building which had been rented out by the appellant. However, exemption was to be allowed for the self occupied portion if the appellant continued to be supported through voluntary contributions and did not generate surpluses year after year. On the basis of the statements made to this effect by the appellant, the Assistant Secretary granted exemption for the self-occupied portions for the period 1991-92 to 2000-2001. It was also stated that the society would have to claim exemption every year and satisfy the conditions required for exemption every year. The appellant then filed an application for reviving the writ petitions which had been disposed of earlier by the High Court. Although this application was allowed by the High Court, the writ petitions were dismissed with the observation that the appellant was at liberty to discharge its liability to the  Page 3 of 8 respondent No.1 by instalments. The appellant has preferred this appeal by way of a Special Leave Petition. The appellant relied on the decision of this Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Children Book Trust 1992 (3) SCC 390 to contend that since it is a charitable organisation and the entire building is used for charitable purposes, it is not liable to pay property tax under Section 62 of the NDMC Act, 1994 in respect of the entire building including the rented portion at all. In the alternative it has been submitted that if the appellant is liable to pay property tax, the power to grant exemption had not been properly exercised by the respondent No.1 under the provisions of Section 124 read with section 72 (e) of the NDMC Act. Learned counsel appearing for the respondents contended that Section 62 of the NDMC Act explicitly made buildings which were not self-occupied by a charitable organisation, subject to house tax. It was further submitted that the decision relied upon by the appellant was not applicable to the appellant’s case. As far as the alternative submission of the appellant is concerned, it is the respondents’ contention that there was no power under the NDMC Act to grant exemption in an individual case. Exemption could only be granted to a class of similarly situated bodies or persons. The appellant has in the meanwhile cleared all the outstanding demands of the respondent No. 1 and continued to apply for exemption from payment of property tax in respect of the entire building. Two of the applications dated 17th May 2001 and 20th August 2001 have been brought on record. An order passed by the Advisor (Revenue) of the NDMC dated 22nd March 2002 limited to the question of fixation of the rateable value of the rented portion for the purposes of house tax has also been brought on record. The order records that the self-occupied portion of the building has been exempted from payment of property tax. However, it is clear from the body of the order that it was not passed in response to the appellant’s application for grant of exemption to the appellant under the provisions either of the Punjab Act or the NDMC Act. Under the Punjab Act, the tax on all property was imposed under Section 61. The statute itself did not allow for any specific exemption in respect of any class of property and left it to the discretion of the Committee or the State Government to grant exemption in the circumstances prescribed. The ""Committee"" has been defined in Section 3(4) as the Municipal Council or a Nagar Panchayat, as the case may be, constituted under Section 12 of the Act. Section 70 of the Punjab Act provided for the ’Power of the Committee in regard to taxes’. Sub-section (2) of Section 70 provided: ""A Committee, by a resolution passed at a special meeting and confirmed by the State Government, may (a) provide that all or any persons may be allowed to compound for taxes imposed under sub-clauses (c), (d) and (e) of clause (1) and under clauses (2) and (3) of section 61: (b) abolish, suspend or reduce in amount any tax imposed under the foregoing sections; or (c) exempt in whole or in part from the payment of any such tax, any person or class of persons or any  Page 4 of 8 property or description of property."" Apart from the power of the Committee under the aforesaid provisions, the State Government was given power under Section 71 by order to : ""exempt in whole or in part from the payment of any such tax any person or class of persons or any property description of property. If at any time it appears to the State Government on complaint made or otherwise, that any tax imposed under the foregoing sections is unfair in its incidence or that the levy thereof or of any part thereof is injurious to the interests of the general public, it may require the committee to take within a specified period measures to remove the objection: and, if within that period the requirement is not complied with to the satisfaction of the State Government the State Government may by notification suspend the levy of the tax or of such part thereof until the objection has been removed."" As far as the NDMC Act is concerned, property tax is leviable on lands and buildings in New Delhi under Section 60(1)(a) read with Section 61(1). Section 62 which has been construed in the impugned order by the Assistant Secretary, is quoted: ""62(1) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the property tax shall be levied in respect of all lands and buildings in New Delhi except : (a) lands and buildings or portions of lands and buildings exclusively occupied and used for public worship or by a society or body for a charitable purpose: Provided that such society or body is supported wholly or in part by voluntary contributions, applies its profits, if any, or other income in promoting its objects and does not pay any dividend or bonus to its members. Explanation ’Charitable purpose’ includes relief of the poor, education and medical relief but does not include a purpose which relates exclusively to the religious teaching. (b) lands and buildings vested in the Council, in respect of which the said tax, if levied, would under the provisions of this Act be leviable primarily on the Council; (c) agricultural lands and buildings (other than dwelling houses).  Page 5 of 8 (2) Lands and buildings or portion thereof shall not be deemed to be exclusively occupied and used for public worship or for a charitable purpose within the meaning of clause (a) of sub-section (1) if any trade or business is carried on in such lands and buildings or portion thereof or if in respect of such lands and buildings or portions thereof, any rent is derived. (3) Where any portion of any land or building is exempt from the property tax by reason of its being exclusively occupied and used for public worship or for a charitable purpose such portion shall be deemed to be a separate property for the purpose of municipal taxation."" If one analyses the relevant clauses of Section 62(1), lands and buildings or portions of lands and buildings are exempt from property tax if they are: (i) exclusively occupied by a society or body for a charitable purpose; (ii) such society or body is supported wholly or in part by voluntary contributions; (iii) the said society applies its profits, if any or other income in promoting its objects and does not pay any dividend or bonus to its members, It is clear that under Section 62(1) of the NDMC Act, if the appellant-society fulfils these three conditions it is entitled as a matter of right to be exempted from payment of property tax. Where the Assistant Secretary erred, was in treating the right to exemption in respect of the self-occupied portions of the appellant’s building as a matter of discretion. It is not. It is a matter of right provided of course of the conditions laid down in Section 62(1) are fulfilled by the society. Sub-section (2) of Section 62, however, carves out two exceptions to this exemption, namely if (a) any trade is carried out in such lands and buildings, or (b) in respect of any portion of such land or building or portion thereof any rent is derived. In such a case, under sub-section (3), the portion of the land or building exclusively occupied and used for charitable purposes under Section 62(1) and the portion, which is excepted under sub-section (2) are deemed to be separate properties for the purpose of municipal taxation. Thus the statutory exemption under Section 62(1) is not available to the society if the building is not self-occupied but is rented out. The section does not make any allowance even if the rental income is used for charitable purposes. The phrase ’for a charitable purpose’ only qualifies self occupation under Section 62(1)(a). The appellant’s claim for the benefit of such statutory exemption under Section 62 of the Act in respect of the rented portion of the building is, therefore, untenable and the Assistant Secretary had rightly rejected it. The appellant’s reliance on the decision of this Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi V. Children Book Trust and Anr. ( supra) is misplaced although in that decision, this Court had construed Section 115(4) (5) and (6) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 which are verbatim the same as Sections 62(1), (2) and (3) of the NDMC Act. There the Court had disposed of two appeals. The first appeal was filed by the Corporation against the Children Book Trust and the second  Page 6 of 8 was by the Safdarjung Enclave Education Society against the Corporation. As far as the appeal filed by the Children Book Trust was concerned, a portion of the premises occupied by the Trust was rented out to a Press. The Municipal Corporation had sought to levy property tax under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 in respect of the entire premises. The Trust filed a writ petition claiming total exemption from payment of property tax under Section 115 (4) of the 1957 Act before the High Court at Delhi. The writ petition was allowed by the learned Single Judge who held that the Trust was entitled to claim total exemption from payment of tax under Section 115(4) of the 1957 Act except in respect of that portion which was rented out. However, the learned Judge held that even from the rental value, the Trust was entitled to claim exemption in the proportion of the income accruing to it from the publication of children’s book which was held to be a charitable purpose. The Division Bench partly allowed the Municipal Corporation’s appeal holding that in view of the mandatory provisions of Section 115(4) of the New Delhi Corporation Act, exemption from the payment of property tax could not be allowed in respect of the area which was rented out or not occupied by the Trust itself for charitable purposes within the meaning of the 1957 Act. The further appeal of the Municipal Corporation before this Court was dismissed. It is to be noted that the Court was only considering the Municipal Corporation’s appeal in respect of the portion of the premises which had not been rented out by the Trust. As far as the rented portion was concerned, the Court noted ""Admittedly, no exemption could be claimed concerning this portion. It is the other portions which are otherwise relevant for the purpose of this case"". In the appeal of the Education Society, the Education Society claimed an exemption in respect of premises owned by it where a school was being run. The Society had filed a writ petition challenging an assessment order of the Municipal Corporation. The writ petition was dismissed by the High Court. The Education Society then preferred an appeal before this Court. The contention which was raised before this Court was that the Society was running the school which was in occupation of the premises and that the giving of education was a charitable purpose and, therefore, the society was entitled to exemption under the provisions of Section 115(4) of the Act. This Court held that the Society could not be said to be occupying the building. ""The School being a separate entity, premises occupied by the school will belong to it and not to the society. Therefore, the society cannot claim to be in exclusive occupation and use of the land and building in question."" It was also held that although the imparting of education may be a charitable purpose, the Society would have to further show that education was the primary objective and not the making of profit. It was also held that unless the society was supported wholly or substantially by voluntary contributions, in view of the proviso to Section 115(4)(a), [Section 62(1)(a) of the NDMC Act] exemption from payment of property tax could not be claimed. None of these findings are relevant for our present purpose. There is no dispute that the appellant-Society before us exclusively occupies a portion of the premises for a charitable purpose and otherwise fulfils the conditions required for exemption from property tax in respect of such portion. We are, in this appeal, unlike in the appeals in the Children Book Trust, only concerned with the balance portion of the building which has been rented out by the appellant. It is true that this Court in Children Book Trust made an observation that: "".if the profits or income of trade or business is devoted to a charitable purpose and no part thereof is  Page 7 of 8 distributed among the members as dividends or bonus, then that trade or business is a means to an end. It is charity. But, if there is a trade or business carried on in a land or building and its profits are not applied to a charitable purpose, sub-section (6) says that that part of the land or building where a trade or business is carried on or from which rent is derived, will be subject to tax."" However, these observations were made in the context of Section 115(4) [Section 62(1) of the NDMC Act)] which envisages societies occupying the subject premises, making profit or deriving income. The proviso to sub-Section 4, clause (a) requires such profits or income to be utilised in promoting the objects of the society and not to be paid by way of dividend or bonus to the members of the society. It was in that connection that the Court made the observation quoted above. The observation would not be relevant to a situation where property is not in occupation of the Society at all but is rented out. Coming to the alternative case of the appellant viz., the grant of exemption in respect of the tax leviable on the rented portions, although, the Assistant Secretary did not have any other option but to consider the appellant’s claim for exemption in view of the direction of the High Court, no discretion is conferred under Section 62 of the NDMC Act on the Assistant Secretary for granting any exemption to the assessee from any portion of the taxes leviable except to the extent the statute itself provides. Section 72(1)(e) on which the appellant has relied provides: ""72(1) The chairperson may, at any time, amend the assessment list (e) by making or cancelling any entry exempting any land or building from liability to property tax; "" This section also does not confer any discretion on the Chairperson to exempt any property from payment of tax. All that it does is to empower the Chairperson to give effect to any exemption otherwise granted, by amending the Assessment List. The power and discretion to grant exemption under the NDMC Act has been conferred on the Council under Section 124. Section 124 provides: ""The Council may, by resolution passed in this behalf, exempt either wholly or in part from the payment of any tax levied under this Act, any class of persons or any class of property or goods."" The respondents are correct in their submission that under Section 124, as far as the present controversy is concerned, the Council’s power must be exercised, if at all, in favour of a class of persons or a class of property. This power may be contrasted with the Punjab Municipal Act where exemption may have been allowed, even in respect of an individual by the Committee under Section 70(2)(c) and the State Government under Section 71. Therefore, while dismissing the appellant’s appeal in so  Page 8 of 8 far as it has claimed statutory exemption under Section 62 in respect of the rented portion of the building, we grant the liberty to the appellant-Society to apply to the Council for exemption from payment of taxes leviable in respect of the rented portion. It would be open to the Council to resolve under the provisions of Section 124 to exempt all persons who are similarly situated as the appellant-society on the application of the appellant. The Council will dispose of the appellant’s representation after giving the appellants an opportunity of being heard. There will be no order as to costs"
9,Appeal (civil) 7999 of 2002,District Rehabilitation Officer & Ors,Jay Kishore Maity & Ors.,0/11/2006,S.B. Sinha & Dalveer Bhandari,"J U D G M E N T WITH Civil Appeal Nos. 4313-4319 of 2003 S.B. Sinha, J. Union of India filed a Scheme for Rehabilitation of the disabled people. The project started with financial assistance of Central Government/Union of India. The full financial assistance was extended till 1993, whereafter only 50% of financial assistance was provided for by the Central Government. The Union of India, however, took up the entire financial burden for the project with effect from 31.1.1998. Pilot projects were started under which centres were established in several States of the country with a view to identify the services required by the disabled population, to assist the man power required for delivering those services to them or to work out the modalities for the types of man power etc. One of such centres was established in Kharagpur in the State of West Bengal and another in the district of Mysore in the State of Karnataka. For the purpose of execution of the said projects, a Project Coordination Committee was constituted. A set of detailed guidelines were circulated. The Project Coordinator would be the main agency to implement the Project and would function through Member Secretary of the State Level Advisory Committee. The Scheme dated 3.1.1983 was circulated with the concerned State Governments by the Joint Secretary of the Union of India. The total package of services for the disabled starting with awareness in the community and ending with their economic rehabilitation was to contain with the following elements: ""1) Creation of community awareness about the disabled population in order to seek community participation in the measures for the welfare of the disabled. 2) parent counseling about the home care and management of the disabled child. 3) promote dissemination of information on prevention, early detection and possibilities of treatment of the disabled. 4) arrangements for screening of disabilities and early referrals. 5) arrangements for physical rehabilitation including medical or surgical intervention. 6) integration of disabled children in normal schools schedule and establishment or special schools wherever necessary. 7) provision of vocational training for the disabled. 8) employment guidance and placement services both in integrated as well as sheltered conditions of the   of 6 disabled."" The category of employees found suitable for recruitment for the project were: (i) Community Health Workers; and (2) Anganwari Workers. The Scheme envisaged that the Pilot Scheme with the infrastructure provided should be utilized by the State Governments with an intent to continue the project. The infrastructures created for these pilot projects was expected to prove to be useful for training the required manpower for future pilot projects and similar centres which the State Governments may like to establish. The Project Coordinators of the Rehabilitation Centres were the officers of the State Governments of States of West Bengal and Karnataka. They selected the employees for the said Rehabilitation Centres. The employees were offered a salary of Rs. 660/- in the scale of Rs.660-60-1100 50-5600. Indisputably they have been working for a long time. Initially as noticed hereinbefore, although funds were provided by an outside agency, the same have been taken over by the Central Government. Terms and conditions of service of the employees appointed were governed by the rules applicable to the employees of the State Governments. The pay-scales applicable to employees of the State Government were also applied to their case. The employees, however, filed Original Applications before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta as also Karnataka at Bangalore, inter alia, contending that they being the employees of the Central Government, the terms and conditions of services applicable to the Central Government should apply in their case also. A preliminary objection was taken as regards of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the premise that the applicants were the employees of the State Governments. By a judgment and order dated 14.7.2000, the Tribunal held: ""12...So we are, therefore, of the clear opinion that applicants were appointed by the Project Officer for and on behalf of the Central Government and the Central Government had direct control over the DRC and fund is being provided by Central Government and we are satisfied from facts that the prima facie it is for determination of the relationship between the employer and the employee which is in existence in this case; Central Government is employer of the applicants and the employees are entitled to claim to be employees of the Central Government. In view of the aforesaid circumstances, we find that there cannot be any dispute in this case that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the grievance of the applicants who were directly appointed and being controlled by the Central Government. It is true that the aforesaid applicants are getting the pay and allowances as per rate prescribed by the Govt. of West Bengal. It is found that the scale prescribed by the government of West Bengal has been adopted by the concerned authorities under the scheme. So, were adoption of the scale of the State Government does not disentitle the applicants the right of status of the Central Government employees under the scheme. 13. In view of the aforesaid circumstances we are of the view that the applicants are the employees of the Central Government though their salary is being paid as per scale of the State Government. Under the circumstances stated above, we allow the application with a direction upon the respondents to treat the aforesaid applicants as employees of the Central Government and to grant the relief’s to the applicants in accordance with the rules in respect of salary, provident fund etc. with immediate effect. No cost."" A writ petition filed thereagainst by Appellants herein has been  Page 3 of 6 dismissed by a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court by reason of the impugned order. The Division Bench although noticed the pleadings of the parties as also the submissions made at the bar at great details, but merely held: ""We have carefully considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties and we are inclined to agree with the findings of the learned Tribunal regarding the status of the private respondents herein. The Scheme for setting up the Pilot Projects for the District Rehabilitation Centres amply demonstrate that the same was a Scheme of the Ministry of Social Welfare, Government of India, and the State Government was merely the implementing agency through its officers of the Social Welfare Directorate. The entire funding and recruitment process and the manner of functioning, as provided for in the Scheme, is under the direct control of the Central Government, and even the State Level Advisory Committee, which was to be chaired by the Secretary of the Social Welfare Department, was required to send periodical reports of the functioning of the District Rehabilitation Centre to the Central Government."" Mr. Doabia, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Appellant, inter alia, contended that keeping in view the scheme floated by the Central Government, the manner in which the funds were secured and implementation of the scheme that took place, it is evident that Respondents were the employees of the State of West Bengal and State of Karnataka respectively. It was submitted that in any event as the project has been wound up from 1st April, 2006 and no budgetary provisions therefor having been made for payment of salaries to the employees, this Court should pass an appropriate order. It was urged that the Central Administrative Tribunal as also the High Court applied wrong tests in determining the relationship of ‘Employer and Employee and failed to consider that effective control over the employees was with the State Governments and not the Central Government. Mr. Doabia has also pointed out that some of the State Governments e.g. State of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu have taken similar projects on their own. Mr. Jaideep Gupta and Mr. P. Vishwanath Shetty, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the State of West Bengal and State of Karnataka, on the other hand, supported the impugned judgments. They, moreover, appealed that having regard to the number of years Respondents had served in the projects, the Scheme should either be directed to be continued or the employees be directed to be absorbed either by the Central Government or by the State Governments of West Bengal Karnataka, as the case may be. By an order dated 13.9.2006, we recorded as under:- ""A statement has been made by Mr. T.S. Doabia, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Union that the Central Government has stopped releasing any fund from 1.4.2006. On a query made by us in that behalf it was stated at the Bar that so far as the employees of the State of West Bengal are concerned, they have been paid salary up to July 2006 and so far as the employees working in the State of Karnataka are concerned, they have been paid their salary up to August 2006. We have been given to understand that the salary to the respondents herein could be disbursed by the Council only from the excess fund available with it from the last  Page 4 of 6 years’ budget and the amount now stands exhausted in view of stoppage of the grant by the Central Government. We direct the State of Karnataka as also the State of West Bengal to state on oath as to whether they would like to continue with the projects in lieu of the scheme as has been done by the States of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. Learned counsel for the Central Government shall hand over a copy of the project adopted by the State of Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan or Chhattisgarh, as the case may be, to Mr. Tapash Ray, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State of West Bengal and Mr. Sanjay Hegde, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Karnataka so as to enable them to seek instructions as to whether their States are prepared to continue with the said projects on the terms adopted by the said States. We would also direct the Government of India to file an affidavit as to what steps, if any, are feasible to be taken by it for continuation of the project at least for some time more so that solution of the problem may be found out by this Court in the meanwhile in the event the States express their inability to continue with the existing project. We also direct the respondents to file affidavit(s) stating as to whether they are ready and willing to serve other projects run by the Central Government, in the event the Government of West Bengal and Government on the other are not ready and willing to continue with the projects. The directors of Social Welfare Department of the State of West Bengal as also the State of Karnataka would also file a status report as regards the project by 26.9.2006."" Pursuant to the said direction, the Director of Social Welfare as also the Secretaries of the Social Welfare Departments of the States of West Bengal and Karnataka have filed their respective status reports. According to the respective State Governments, they are not in a position to take over the project. It was urged that the State Governments run other projects and also provide adequate funds to Non-Governmental Organisations which have been working in the field and the projects should, thus, be directed to be continued by the Central Government only. In its counter-affidavit, the State of West Bengal, inter alia, contended that the Central Government has been running four other projects in the District of Midnapore. The State Governments has other projects for which budgetary provisions to the extent of Rs. 6 crores per annum have been made and thus in view of the acute financial constraints, continuation of the projects like the present one would not serve any purpose. An affidavit has also been filed by the State of Karnataka almost to the same effect. The Parliament enacted the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. The Act was enacted to give effect to the proclamation on the full participation and equality of people with disabilities on both Central and State Governments. Implementation of its provisions is the primary responsibility of the State Governments. The projects were started at different centres in different States by the Central Governments by way of a Scheme. The funds for the said projects initially came from the Central Government. The purpose of a pilot project has been noticed by us hereinbefore. The control of the Rehabilitation Centres for the benefit of the people for whom the same were started was with the concerned State Governments. The employees do not become the employees of the Central Government only because the project was conceived by it or it used to give  Page 5 of 6 directions from time to time. The tests which are determinative for ascertaining the relationship of ‘Employer and Employee’ are well known viz. functional test or control test or organisational test etc. For determination of relationship of the employer and the employees, separate tests may have to be applied having regard to the factual matrix involved in each case. The parties did not adduce any oral evidence before the Central Administrative Tribunal. The Central Administrative Tribunal although referred to some of the decisions of this Court, but without applying them, opined that Respondents are the employees of the Central Government. No reason has been assigned therefor. No analysis of the available materials was made. The question has been considered by this Court in Workmen of Nilgiri Coop. Mkt. Society v. State of T.N. and Others [(2004) 3 SCC 514], wherein it has been held: ""Determination of the vexed questions as to whether a contract is a contract of service or contract for service and whether the employees concerned are employees of the contractors has never been an easy task. No decision of this Court has laid down any hard and fast rule nor is it possible to do so. The question in each case has to be answered having regard to the fact involved therein. No single test \026 be it control test, be it organization or any other test \026 has been held to be the determinative factor for determining the jural relationship of employer and employee.""

KGSD Canteen Empoyees’ Welfare Assn. and Others [(2006) 1 SCC 567], this Court held: ""We, however, intend to point out that in a case of this nature even an industrial adjudicator may have some difficulty in coming to the conclusion that employees of a canteen for all intent and purport are employees of the principal employer."" We, therefore, with respect, are unable to agree with the findings of the Central Administrative Tribunal as also the Division Bench of the High Court. A question has arisen as to whether the employees are the employees of the State of West Bengal or the District Rehabilitation Centres. In view of the order proposed to be passed by us, it may not be adverted to at this state as we are of the opinion that the projects should be continued by the State of West Bengal and the State of Karnataka as the case may be. Even if the States think it fit to close down the project, the services of the employees working in the rehabilitation centres should be continued. In a case of this nature, however, we think it expedient to invoke our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. The Central Government has categorically stated that those employees who would opt for employment under the Central Government may be accommodated in its ongoing projects. Pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof, the concerned employees who have affirmed affidavits showing inclination to serve any project under the Central Government, may be absorbed by it. Services of those employees may be utilized by the Central Government in any of its project. They would, however, be continued to be paid salaries on the same scale of pay. Their experience may also be considered for the purpose of determination of their seniority, subject of course to any rule which is in operation in the field. All other financial benefits including those of superannuatory benefits should be protected. It is, however, clarified that such employment under the Central Government would be temporary and  Page 6 of 6 personal posts which would come to an end with the retirement of the concerned employees. Similarly those Respondents who have opted for their employment with the State of West Bengal or the State of Karnataka, as the case may be would be absorbed by the States of West Bengal and Karnataka, as the case may be, on the same terms and conditions as referred to hereinbefore. Keeping in view the nature of order passed by us, it is clarified that the same shall not be treated as a precedent. We also make it clear that these orders have been passed by us keeping the stand taken by the parties. These appeals are disposed of with the aforementioned directions. There shall be no order as to costs.","J U D G M E N T WITH Civil Appeal Nos. 4313-4319 of 2003 S.B. Sinha, J. Union of India filed a Scheme for Rehabilitation of the disabled people. The project started with financial assistance of Central Government/Union of India. The full financial assistance was extended till 1993, whereafter only 50% of financial assistance was provided for by the Central Government. The Union of India, however, took up the entire financial burden for the project with effect from 31.1.1998. Pilot projects were started under which centres were established in several States of the country with a view to identify the services required by the disabled population, to assist the man power required for delivering those services to them or to work out the modalities for the types of man power etc. One of such centres was established in Kharagpur in the State of West Bengal and another in the district of Mysore in the State of Karnataka. For the purpose of execution of the said projects, a Project Coordination Committee was constituted. A set of detailed guidelines were circulated. The Project Coordinator would be the main agency to implement the Project and would function through Member Secretary of the State Level Advisory Committee. The Scheme dated 3.1.1983 was circulated with the concerned State Governments by the Joint Secretary of the Union of India. The total package of services for the disabled starting with awareness in the community and ending with their economic rehabilitation was to contain with the following elements: ""1) Creation of community awareness about the disabled population in order to seek community participation in the measures for the welfare of the disabled. 2) parent counseling about the home care and management of the disabled child. 3) promote dissemination of information on prevention, early detection and possibilities of treatment of the disabled. 4) arrangements for screening of disabilities and early referrals. 5) arrangements for physical rehabilitation including medical or surgical intervention. 6) integration of disabled children in normal schools schedule and establishment or special schools wherever necessary. 7) provision of vocational training for the disabled. 8) employment guidance and placement services both in integrated as well as sheltered conditions of the   of 6 disabled."" The category of employees found suitable for recruitment for the project were: (i) Community Health Workers; and (2) Anganwari Workers. The Scheme envisaged that the Pilot Scheme with the infrastructure provided should be utilized by the State Governments with an intent to continue the project. The infrastructures created for these pilot projects was expected to prove to be useful for training the required manpower for future pilot projects and similar centres which the State Governments may like to establish. The Project Coordinators of the Rehabilitation Centres were the officers of the State Governments of States of West Bengal and Karnataka. They selected the employees for the said Rehabilitation Centres. The employees were offered a salary of Rs. 660/- in the scale of Rs.660-60-1100 50-5600. Indisputably they have been working for a long time. Initially as noticed hereinbefore, although funds were provided by an outside agency, the same have been taken over by the Central Government. Terms and conditions of service of the employees appointed were governed by the rules applicable to the employees of the State Governments. The pay-scales applicable to employees of the State Government were also applied to their case. The employees, however, filed Original Applications before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta as also Karnataka at Bangalore, inter alia, contending that they being the employees of the Central Government, the terms and conditions of services applicable to the Central Government should apply in their case also. A preliminary objection was taken as regards of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the premise that the applicants were the employees of the State Governments. By a judgment and order dated 14.7.2000, the Tribunal held: ""12...So we are, therefore, of the clear opinion that applicants were appointed by the Project Officer for and on behalf of the Central Government and the Central Government had direct control over the DRC and fund is being provided by Central Government and we are satisfied from facts that the prima facie it is for determination of the relationship between the employer and the employee which is in existence in this case; Central Government is employer of the applicants and the employees are entitled to claim to be employees of the Central Government. In view of the aforesaid circumstances, we find that there cannot be any dispute in this case that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the grievance of the applicants who were directly appointed and being controlled by the Central Government. It is true that the aforesaid applicants are getting the pay and allowances as per rate prescribed by the Govt. of West Bengal. It is found that the scale prescribed by the government of West Bengal has been adopted by the concerned authorities under the scheme. So, were adoption of the scale of the State Government does not disentitle the applicants the right of status of the Central Government employees under the scheme. 13. In view of the aforesaid circumstances we are of the view that the applicants are the employees of the Central Government though their salary is being paid as per scale of the State Government. Under the circumstances stated above, we allow the application with a direction upon the respondents to treat the aforesaid applicants as employees of the Central Government and to grant the relief’s to the applicants in accordance with the rules in respect of salary, provident fund etc. with immediate effect. No cost."" A writ petition filed thereagainst by Appellants herein has been  Page 3 of 6 dismissed by a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court by reason of the impugned order. The Division Bench although noticed the pleadings of the parties as also the submissions made at the bar at great details, but merely held: ""We have carefully considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties and we are inclined to agree with the findings of the learned Tribunal regarding the status of the private respondents herein. The Scheme for setting up the Pilot Projects for the District Rehabilitation Centres amply demonstrate that the same was a Scheme of the Ministry of Social Welfare, Government of India, and the State Government was merely the implementing agency through its officers of the Social Welfare Directorate. The entire funding and recruitment process and the manner of functioning, as provided for in the Scheme, is under the direct control of the Central Government, and even the State Level Advisory Committee, which was to be chaired by the Secretary of the Social Welfare Department, was required to send periodical reports of the functioning of the District Rehabilitation Centre to the Central Government."" Mr. Doabia, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Appellant, inter alia, contended that keeping in view the scheme floated by the Central Government, the manner in which the funds were secured and implementation of the scheme that took place, it is evident that Respondents were the employees of the State of West Bengal and State of Karnataka respectively. It was submitted that in any event as the project has been wound up from 1st April, 2006 and no budgetary provisions therefor having been made for payment of salaries to the employees, this Court should pass an appropriate order. It was urged that the Central Administrative Tribunal as also the High Court applied wrong tests in determining the relationship of ‘Employer and Employee and failed to consider that effective control over the employees was with the State Governments and not the Central Government. Mr. Doabia has also pointed out that some of the State Governments e.g. State of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu have taken similar projects on their own. Mr. Jaideep Gupta and Mr. P. Vishwanath Shetty, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the State of West Bengal and State of Karnataka, on the other hand, supported the impugned judgments. They, moreover, appealed that having regard to the number of years Respondents had served in the projects, the Scheme should either be directed to be continued or the employees be directed to be absorbed either by the Central Government or by the State Governments of West Bengal Karnataka, as the case may be. By an order dated 13.9.2006, we recorded as under:- ""A statement has been made by Mr. T.S. Doabia, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Union that the Central Government has stopped releasing any fund from 1.4.2006. On a query made by us in that behalf it was stated at the Bar that so far as the employees of the State of West Bengal are concerned, they have been paid salary up to July 2006 and so far as the employees working in the State of Karnataka are concerned, they have been paid their salary up to August 2006. We have been given to understand that the salary to the respondents herein could be disbursed by the Council only from the excess fund available with it from the last  Page 4 of 6 years’ budget and the amount now stands exhausted in view of stoppage of the grant by the Central Government. We direct the State of Karnataka as also the State of West Bengal to state on oath as to whether they would like to continue with the projects in lieu of the scheme as has been done by the States of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. Learned counsel for the Central Government shall hand over a copy of the project adopted by the State of Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan or Chhattisgarh, as the case may be, to Mr. Tapash Ray, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State of West Bengal and Mr. Sanjay Hegde, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Karnataka so as to enable them to seek instructions as to whether their States are prepared to continue with the said projects on the terms adopted by the said States. We would also direct the Government of India to file an affidavit as to what steps, if any, are feasible to be taken by it for continuation of the project at least for some time more so that solution of the problem may be found out by this Court in the meanwhile in the event the States express their inability to continue with the existing project. We also direct the respondents to file affidavit(s) stating as to whether they are ready and willing to serve other projects run by the Central Government, in the event the Government of West Bengal and Government on the other are not ready and willing to continue with the projects. The directors of Social Welfare Department of the State of West Bengal as also the State of Karnataka would also file a status report as regards the project by 26.9.2006."" Pursuant to the said direction, the Director of Social Welfare as also the Secretaries of the Social Welfare Departments of the States of West Bengal and Karnataka have filed their respective status reports. According to the respective State Governments, they are not in a position to take over the project. It was urged that the State Governments run other projects and also provide adequate funds to Non-Governmental Organisations which have been working in the field and the projects should, thus, be directed to be continued by the Central Government only. In its counter-affidavit, the State of West Bengal, inter alia, contended that the Central Government has been running four other projects in the District of Midnapore. The State Governments has other projects for which budgetary provisions to the extent of Rs. 6 crores per annum have been made and thus in view of the acute financial constraints, continuation of the projects like the present one would not serve any purpose. An affidavit has also been filed by the State of Karnataka almost to the same effect. The Parliament enacted the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. The Act was enacted to give effect to the proclamation on the full participation and equality of people with disabilities on both Central and State Governments. Implementation of its provisions is the primary responsibility of the State Governments. The projects were started at different centres in different States by the Central Governments by way of a Scheme. The funds for the said projects initially came from the Central Government. The purpose of a pilot project has been noticed by us hereinbefore. The control of the Rehabilitation Centres for the benefit of the people for whom the same were started was with the concerned State Governments. The employees do not become the employees of the Central Government only because the project was conceived by it or it used to give  Page 5 of 6 directions from time to time. The tests which are determinative for ascertaining the relationship of ‘Employer and Employee’ are well known viz. functional test or control test or organisational test etc. For determination of relationship of the employer and the employees, separate tests may have to be applied having regard to the factual matrix involved in each case.

10,SURENDRA NARAIN @ MUNNA PANDEY,,THE STATE OF U.P.,7/11/1997,"M.M. PUNCHHI, M. SRINIVASAN","THE 7TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 1997 Hon’ble Mr.Justice M.M.Punchhi Hon’ble Mr.Justice M.Srinivasan Arvind Kumar) Adv (Ms. Manisha Bhardwaj) Adv. for Ms. Laxmi Arvind, Advs for the appellant Vishwajit Singh, Adv. for A.S.Pundir, Adv. for the Respondent J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: SRINIVASAN.J This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Allahabad confirming the order of conviction passed by the III Additional Sessions Judge, Kanpur n a charge under Section 302 I.P.C. against the appellant and sentence for rigorous imprisonment for life. 2. The case of the prosecution was as follows: On April 7, 1977 at about 3.30 P.M. the victim Shree Prakash was gong in rickshaw with is servant Nanhu Singh (PW-3) followed by Balkrishan Bajpai (PW-1) and (PW -2) in another rickshaw in the crossing of Alumandi, Cooperganj, Kanpur within the area of the police station Anwar ganj. At that time the appellant arrived at the spot sitting on the pillon of a motor cycle driven by another person, shot the victim with a pistol and sped away. The witnesses proceeded to the police station which was very near the place of occurrence and lodged a complaint around 3.45 PM The victim was taken to the hospital where he was declared dead. While PW 1 stayed at the police station for giving a statement, PW 2 went to inform the sister of the victim. The name of the appellant was mentioned by PW 1 in the FIR who could not however give the name of the person who was driving the motor-cycle though he claimed that he could identify him on seeing his face. The appellant could not be traced till he surrendered in Court on 13.5.1977 3. On that date itself the appellant moved an application before the C.M.M.Kanpur claiming that witnesses were not known to him and that a test identification parade should be ordered. The C.M.M. dismissed it on the ground that the offence being one exclusively triable by Court of Sessions,   of 9 he could not pass orders thereon. That order was challenged in the Court of Session, Kanpur. The latter allowed the prayer by order dated 14.6.77 and directed the appellant to be up for identification. But the identification parade was not held. 4. The trial went on and the prosecution examined as many as nine witnesses, including three eye witnesses. The accused while putting forward a case of total denial examined three witnesses. The trial judge accepted the case of the prosecution and found the accused guilty of murder punishable under Section 302 I.P.C. On appeal, the High Court confirmed the same. 5. In this appeal, learned counsel has urged five contentions - (1) The failure of the police to put up the appellant for identification parade inspite of an order of the Court of Sessions is fatal to the prosecution inasmuch as the appellant has challenged the claim of PWs 1 to 3 that they knew his already. (2) The non-examination of the rickshaw pullers is a vital factor omitted to be considered by courts below; (3) The evidence of PW3 runs counter to the medical evidence and deserves to be rejected; (4) The ’conduct of PW 1 after the occurrence was unnatural and he should have been disbelieved; (5) There was no motive for the appellant to commit the offence. 6. We will presently consider them seriatim. The first contention is pressed rather strongly by the learned counsel on the basis of an observation made in Shri Ram Versus The State of U.P. (1975) 3 S.C.C. 495. The Court said in that case that the circumstance that the accused had voluntarily accepted the risk being identified in a parade but was denied that opportunity was an important point in his favour. In that case the trial court was influenced by the aforesaid circumstance and acquitted the accused. On appeal the High Court rejected the same as inconsequential by observing that oral testimony of witnesses, eve if not tested by holding an identification parade, can be made the basis of conviction if the request made by the accused is groundless and the witnesses knew the accused prior to the occurrence. This Court while holding that no rule of law required that the oral testimony of a witness should be corroborated by evidence of identification and that such evidence is itself a weak type of evidence observed. ""But the point of the matter is that the Court which acquitted Shri Ram was justifiably influenced by the consideration that though at the earliest stage he had asked that the identification parade he held, the demand was opposed by the prosecution and the parade was therefore not held."" Moreover, in that case there was serous infirmity in the testimony of the eye witnesses who deposed against the accused and this Court found it to be unrealistic and unacceptable. 7. The purpose and evidentiary value of identification parade have been considered in a number of case. In Inre Sangiah 49 Cr. L.J.89 Rajamannar, J discussed the matter at length and said thus: I am unable to find any provision in the Code which entitles an accused to demand that an identification parade should be held at or before the enquiry or the trial. An identification parade  Page 3 of 9 belongs to the stage of investigation by the police. the question whether a witness has or has not identified the accused during the investigation is not one which is in itself relevant at the trial. The actual evidence regarding identification is that which is given by the witnesses in the Court. The fact that a particular witness identification parade is only a circumstance corroborative of the identification in a Court. If a witness has not identified the accused at the parade or otherwise during the investigation the fact may be relied on by the accused, but I find nothing in the provisions of the Code wh ch confers a right on the accused to demand that the investigation should be conducted in a particular way. As M.W.N. 427 ""Identification Parades are held not for the purpose of giving defence advocates material to work on, but in order to satisfy investigating officers of the bone fine of the prosecution witnesses"" In AIR 1948 Lah 303 Blacker, J. held thus: ""Whenever an accused person disputes the ability of the prosecution witness to identify him, the Court should direct an identification parade to be held save in the most exceptional circumstances"" With great respect to the learned Judge I am unable to find any provision of law which compels the Court the so direct a parade. It is not clear from the judgment whether the Court making an enquiry or holding the trial should stay its proceedings and direct the In may opinion it does not take into account the important fact that an identification parade is a part of the investigation and once the case has reached the stage of an enquiry before the Magistrate the investigation is at an end all that takes place in Court form part of the record of the case. Now it is quite clear that statements made at an identification parade are not substantive evidence at the trial. It must be very embarrassing to the Magistrate making an enquiry to listen to statements made by the witnesses at an identification parade which will not be evidence at the enquiry. Further it is not  Page 4 of 9 incumbent on the prosecution to examines all the witnesses cited by them and all these who took part in the identification parade. It will then mean that the Magistrate has heard the statement of witnesses who will not be examined at the enquiry. If on the other hand it is suggested that a different Magistrate should hold the identification parade it appears to me that there is no provision whatever for such a course when a particular Magistrate is seized of the case. The observations In AIR 1946 Lah 48 are rally obiter because that case dealt with a regular appeal against the conviction by a Court of Session. In that case the Magistrate who made the enquiry refused an application by the accused to arrange for an identification parade on the following grounds viz. that the witnesses knew the accused before and that the application was made only for the purpose of delay. The learned Judges held that the reasons given by the magistrate were not sound. It is true that they went on to observe that should any serious question of identity arises during the course of the trial the ability of the witnesses to identify the accused may be put to tost before the trial. With great respect I do not agree. If a case is posted for trail any test as to the ability or creditability of the witnesses should be decided only in Court and not by means of an identification parade, the proceedings at which will not form part of the record of the Court. 8. In Kanta Prashad Versus Delhi Administration AIR 1958 SC 350, this Court held that failure to hold test identification parade does not make inadmissible the evidence of identification in Court and that the weight to be attached to such identification is a matter for the Courts of fact and it is not for the Supreme Court to reassess the evidence unless exceptional grounds are established necessitating such a course. 9. In State versus Dhanpat AIR 1960 Patna 582 cited before us, it was held that if the witnesses do not give the name of any accused, it is necessary to hold a test identification parade and where a witness gives the name of the accused, ordinarily no such parade is necessary. The Court however said that if any accused hold out a challenge and says that he will not be identified by the witnesses or makes a prayer that he should be put upon a test identification parade, such a parade must always be held in order to meet the challenge. The Court also said that if the accused was arrested on the spot and was in custody from that time upto the date of trial, there could be no question  Page 5 of 9 at all about his identity. 10. A Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court dealt with the entire subject of identification Parade in Ashrafi & Anr. Versus The State 1961 (1) Crl. L. J.340. It was held that the identification of an accused who is already known to the identifier is futile. 11. In Budhsen & Anr. Versus State of U.P. AIR 1970 S.C. 132 it was held that identification parades belong to the investigation stage and generally held with the primary object of enabling the witnesses to identify persons concerned in the offence who were not previously known to them, The legal effect of identification parades was stated as follows: "".....that certain person are brought to jail or some other place and makes statements either express or implied that a certain individuals whom they point out are persons whom they recognized as having been concerned in the crime. They do not constitute substantive evidence"" 12. In Tek Chand Versus State AIR 1965 Punjab 146, cited by learned counsel, a Division Bench of the Punjab High Court held that the accused cannot compel the prosecution to hold their identification during the investigation and there is no law or procedure under which the Magistrate could pass such an order. The Bench proceeded to hold that if such a prayer is made by the accused and the prosecution opposes the same, it exposes the witnesses of identification to a genuine criticism that they would probably not be label to identify the offenders correctly if the parade was held. The Court held that when the request for identification parade was refused for no valid reason and the court identification was made long afterwards, the identification evidence in the court could not be relied on, unless it was a corroborated. 13. In Jadunath Singh Versus State of H.P. AIR 1971 S.C.363 a Bench of Three Judges this Court held that failure to hold test identification of accused is not fatal in all cases. The Bench referred to the case law on the subject including the decision of the Madras High Court in the Sangiah’s case and held as follows: ""It seems to us that the reason given by the pubic prosecutor in the report and the reason given by the Additional District Magistrate (Judicial) in the order directing that identification requested for be not held were not valid. The fact that the chargesheet had been received and the accused had been named by P.Ws was no justification for not having ordered the test identification. But on the facts of this case it is clear that PW2 at least knew that accused from before. As regards PW 3 although he claims to have known the accused, it is clear that his knowledge of the accused was very scant and if had not been for the evidence of PW2 we would not have placed reliance on the evidence of PS 3 in view of the fact that the police did not ask him to identify the appellant. It is stated in Phipson on the Law of Evidence, 9th Ed. P.415d as follows:  Page 6 of 9 ""In criminal cases it is improper to identify the accused only when in the dock: The Police should place him, before hand, with the orders, and ask the witness to pick him out. Nor should the witness e guided in any way, nor asked ""is that the main""?"" We consider that the same is the law in India, if the identify is in doubt. Accordingly on the facts of this case we are of the opinion that the trial was not vitiated because the accused persons were denied identification. The same Bench dealt with the State of U.P. Versus Raju AIR 1971 S.C. 708 and held that in the absence of request from accused, State is not bound to hold identification parade when they were arrested on the spot. 14. In Golam Majibuddin Versus State of West Bengal 1972 Crl. L. J. 1342, another Bench of three Judges of this Court held that when the witness stated that he already knew the accused before the day of occurrence and it was not the case of the accused that he was not known to the witness previously, test identification would serve no purpose. The same Bench had not consider a converse case in ""Rameshwar singh Versus State of J & K AIR 1972 S.C. 102. The Bench stated the law thus: ""Before dealing with the evidence relating to identification of the appellant it may be remembered that the substantive evidence of a witness is his evidence in Court but when the accused person is not previously known to the witness concerned then the identification of the accused by the witness soon after the former’s arrest is of vital importance because it furnishes to investigating agency an assurance that the investigation is proceeding on right line in addition furnishing corroboration of the evidence to be given by the witness later in Court at the trial. From this point of view it is a matter of great importance both for the investigating agency and for the accused and a fortiori for the proper administration of justice that such identification delay after the arrest of the unreasonable delay after the arrest of the accused and that all the necessary precautions and safeguards are effectively taken so that the investigation proceeds on correct line for punishing the real culprit. It would, in addition, be fair to the witness concerned who was a stranger to the accused because in that event the chances of his memory fading are reduced and he is required to identify the alleged culprit a the earliest  Page 7 of 9 possible opportunity after the occurrence. It is thus and thus alone that justice and fair play can be assured both to the accused and to the prosecution. The identification during police investigation, it may be re-called, is not substantive evidence in law and it can only be used for corroborating and contradicting evidence of the witness concerned as given in Court. The identification proceeding, therefore, must be go conducted that the evidence with regard to them when given at the trial, enable the Court safely to form appropriate judicial opinion about its evidentiary value for the purpose of corroborating or contradicting the statement in the Court of the identifying witness."" On the facts of the case, it was found that the name of the accused was not mentioned in the FIR. This Court found the witnesss to be untruthful. This Court found that the High Court had erroneously relied upon statements recorded under Section 161 Cr. P.C. for the purpose of corroboration of certain statement made in Court. On that basis, the judgment of the High Court was set aside and the appellant was acquitted. 15. In Dharamvir Versus State of M.P. (1974) 4 S.C.C. 150, it was held that no identification parade was called for as the victim mentioned the names of the accused in the FIR. 16. In Mahtab Singh versus The State of M.P. (1975) 3 SCC 407 the Bench held that the need for identification parade arises only if the assailants are not previusly known to the witnesses. It is to be noticed that it is the very same Bench which dealt with ""Shri Ram’s case (supra) relied on by the appellant and referred to by us in the beginning. 17. In Harbhajan Singh Versus State of J & K AIR 1975 S.C. 1814 a Bench of Three Judges followed Jadunnath Singh’s case (supra) and held that failure of investigating officer to hold identification parade is not necessarily fatal. 18. In Kanan Versus State of Korala, AIR 1979 S.C. 1127, the Court held that where a witness identifies an accused who is not known to hm in the Court for the first time, his evidence is absolutely valuless unless there has been a previous test identification parade to test his power of observation. 19. In Narendra Singh Versus State of H.P. (1987) 2 S.C.C. 236, the attack on deceased was witnessed by an uninterested and independent witness who knew the accused already. That witness snatched from the accused the Kirpan and the turban when he escaped and deposited the same in the police station. the FIR was lodged within 15 minutes and the accused was named therein. The Court held that the question of identification was of no consequence. 20. In Romesh Kumar Versus State of Punjab, 1993 Crl. L.J. 1800, a Bench of Two Judges held that holding of identification parade was not necessary as the murder took place in the rickshaw and the rickshaw puller stated that the knew the accused and that conviction based primarily on his testimony was proper. 21. On a perusal of the above rulings it is clear that the failure to held the test identification parade even after a  Page 8 of 9 demand by the accused is not always fatal and it is only one of the relevant factors to be taken into consideration alongwith the other evidence on record. if the claim of the ocular witnesss that they knew the accused already is found to be true, the failure to hold a test identification parade is inconsequential. 22. Turning to the facts of this case, it is seen that PW 1 had mentioned the name of the accused in the FIR which was given within 15 minutes of the occurrence. The other two eye witnesses, PW 2 and PW3 also knew the accused previously. The crucial factor is that the accused previously. The crucial factor is that the accused was related to the deceased as a son his ""Sala"" and PW 1 was also related to the deceased. The accused had never denied the relationship. As the trial Judge has observed, "" there is not a scintilla of evidence"" that PW 1 had a grudge against the accused. There is also no evidence that the wife of the deceased had any enmity with the accused. She would not have allowed a false case to be foisted on her brother’s son. The accused was not traceable from 7.4.77 to 13.5.77. On the facts of the case, his application for the test identification parade on his surrender after such a long time does not appear to be bone fide. In any event, the evidence on record as accepted by the Courts below is sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused. Further the point does not seem to have been argued before the trial court or the High Court. On the facts of this case there is no doubt that the failure to hold a test identification parade in spite of an order passed by the Sessions Court is not fatal to the prosecution. 23. The second contention is without any merit. The evidence adduced by the prosecution is adequate to prove the charge. The non-examination of another person who was on the scene of occurrence does not make the evidence of PWs 1 to 3 unreliable. It is needless to point out that evidence has to be weighed and not counted. 24. The third contention is based on the statement of PW3 in his deposition that Shri Prakash sustained injury in the back whereas the medical report showed that two gunshot wounds were in the left side chest upper part and inner to nipple. Another gunshot wound was found in the spine medial part in thoracic region. The fact that PW3 was travelling in the same rickshaw as his master, the deceased is established beyond doubt. His clothes which got stained by the blood which oozed out of the wounds of the deceased were taken by the investigating officer. The High Court has discused this aspect of the matter at some length and we agree with the reasoning of the High Court. As pointed out by the High Court the witness having seen the exit wound on the back of the deceased bleeding, thought that he had been hit in the back. Hence we reject this contention. 25. The fourth contention is equally without any substance. The argument is that PW1 would have in the first instance taken the victim to the hospital instead of police station and in any event would have accompanied PW 3 to the hospital. According to the learned counsel the fact that PW 1 stayed in the police station to given a statement after sending PW3 and the victim to the hospital throws considerable suspicion on his credibility. We are unable to accept this contention. The evidence shows that the victim died immediately after the firing. The witness thought fit to stay back at the police station to get his complaint registered. Here again, the reasoning of the High Court is unassailable and we agree with the same. 26. The fifth and the last contention that there was no  Page 9 of 9 motive for the appellant t commit the offence is also without any merit. There is ample evidence on record to show that there was a dispute between the appellant and the deceased which romainod unsettled. The way in which the deceased was killed shows that the appellant had the intention to commit the offence of murder and accordingly carried out the same. But it is well settled that when the fact of murder has been proved. there is necessity to prove motive. 27. In sum, the appeal has to suffer a dismissal and is accordingly dismissed","THE 7TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 1997 Hon’ble Mr.Justice M.M.Punchhi Hon’ble Mr.Justice M.Srinivasan Arvind Kumar) Adv (Ms. Manisha Bhardwaj) Adv. for Ms. Laxmi Arvind, Advs for the appellant Vishwajit Singh, Adv. for A.S.Pundir, Adv. for the Respondent J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: SRINIVASAN.J This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Allahabad confirming the order of conviction passed by the III Additional Sessions Judge, Kanpur n a charge under Section 302 I.P.C. against the appellant and sentence for rigorous imprisonment for life. 2. The case of the prosecution was as follows: On April 7, 1977 at about 3.30 P.M. the victim Shree Prakash was gong in rickshaw with is servant Nanhu Singh (PW-3) followed by Balkrishan Bajpai (PW-1) and (PW -2) in another rickshaw in the crossing of Alumandi, Cooperganj, Kanpur within the area of the police station Anwar ganj. At that time the appellant arrived at the spot sitting on the pillon of a motor cycle driven by another person, shot the victim with a pistol and sped away. The witnesses proceeded to the police station which was very near the place of occurrence and lodged a complaint around 3.45 PM The victim was taken to the hospital where he was declared dead. While PW 1 stayed at the police station for giving a statement, PW 2 went to inform the sister of the victim. The name of the appellant was mentioned by PW 1 in the FIR who could not however give the name of the person who was driving the motor-cycle though he claimed that he could identify him on seeing his face. The appellant could not be traced till he surrendered in Court on 13.5.1977 3. On that date itself the appellant moved an application before the C.M.M.Kanpur claiming that witnesses were not known to him and that a test identification parade should be ordered. The C.M.M. dismissed it on the ground that the offence being one exclusively triable by Court of Sessions,   of 9 he could not pass orders thereon. That order was challenged in the Court of Session, Kanpur. The latter allowed the prayer by order dated 14.6.77 and directed the appellant to be up for identification. But the identification parade was not held. 4. The trial went on and the prosecution examined as many as nine witnesses, including three eye witnesses. The accused while putting forward a case of total denial examined three witnesses. The trial judge accepted the case of the prosecution and found the accused guilty of murder punishable under Section 302 I.P.C. On appeal, the High Court confirmed the same. 5. In this appeal, learned counsel has urged five contentions - (1) The failure of the police to put up the appellant for identification parade inspite of an order of the Court of Sessions is fatal to the prosecution inasmuch as the appellant has challenged the claim of PWs 1 to 3 that they knew his already. (2) The non-examination of the rickshaw pullers is a vital factor omitted to be considered by courts below; (3) The evidence of PW3 runs counter to the medical evidence and deserves to be rejected; (4) The ’conduct of PW 1 after the occurrence was unnatural and he should have been disbelieved; (5) There was no motive for the appellant to commit the offence. 6. We will presently consider them seriatim. The first contention is pressed rather strongly by the learned counsel on the basis of an observation made in Shri Ram Versus The State of U.P. (1975) 3 S.C.C. 495. The Court said in that case that the circumstance that the accused had voluntarily accepted the risk being identified in a parade but was denied that opportunity was an important point in his favour. In that case the trial court was influenced by the aforesaid circumstance and acquitted the accused. On appeal the High Court rejected the same as inconsequential by observing that oral testimony of witnesses, eve if not tested by holding an identification parade, can be made the basis of conviction if the request made by the accused is groundless and the witnesses knew the accused prior to the occurrence. This Court while holding that no rule of law required that the oral testimony of a witness should be corroborated by evidence of identification and that such evidence is itself a weak type of evidence observed. ""But the point of the matter is that the Court which acquitted Shri Ram was justifiably influenced by the consideration that though at the earliest stage he had asked that the identification parade he held, the demand was opposed by the prosecution and the parade was therefore not held."" Moreover, in that case there was serous infirmity in the testimony of the eye witnesses who deposed against the accused and this Court found it to be unrealistic and unacceptable. 7. The purpose and evidentiary value of identification parade have been considered in a number of case. In Inre Sangiah 49 Cr. L.J.89 Rajamannar, J discussed the matter at length and said thus: I am unable to find any provision in the Code which entitles an accused to demand that an identification parade should be held at or before the enquiry or the trial. An identification parade  Page 3 of 9 belongs to the stage of investigation by the police. the question whether a witness has or has not identified the accused during the investigation is not one which is in itself relevant at the trial. The actual evidence regarding identification is that which is given by the witnesses in the Court. The fact that a particular witness identification parade is only a circumstance corroborative of the identification in a Court. If a witness has not identified the accused at the parade or otherwise during the investigation the fact may be relied on by the accused, but I find nothing in the provisions of the Code wh ch confers a right on the accused to demand that the investigation should be conducted in a particular way. As M.W.N. 427 ""Identification Parades are held not for the purpose of giving defence advocates material to work on, but in order to satisfy investigating officers of the bone fine of the prosecution witnesses"" In AIR 1948 Lah 303 Blacker, J. held thus: ""Whenever an accused person disputes the ability of the prosecution witness to identify him, the Court should direct an identification parade to be held save in the most exceptional circumstances"" With great respect to the learned Judge I am unable to find any provision of law which compels the Court the so direct a parade. It is not clear from the judgment whether the Court making an enquiry or holding the trial should stay its proceedings and direct the In may opinion it does not take into account the important fact that an identification parade is a part of the investigation and once the case has reached the stage of an enquiry before the Magistrate the investigation is at an end all that takes place in Court form part of the record of the case. Now it is quite clear that statements made at an identification parade are not substantive evidence at the trial. It must be very embarrassing to the Magistrate making an enquiry to listen to statements made by the witnesses at an identification parade which will not be evidence at the enquiry. Further it is not  Page 4 of 9 incumbent on the prosecution to examines all the witnesses cited by them and all these who took part in the identification parade. It will then mean that the Magistrate has heard the statement of witnesses who will not be examined at the enquiry. If on the other hand it is suggested that a different Magistrate should hold the identification parade it appears to me that there is no provision whatever for such a course when a particular Magistrate is seized of the case. The observations In AIR 1946 Lah 48 are rally obiter because that case dealt with a regular appeal against the conviction by a Court of Session. In that case the Magistrate who made the enquiry refused an application by the accused to arrange for an identification parade on the following grounds viz. that the witnesses knew the accused before and that the application was made only for the purpose of delay. The learned Judges held that the reasons given by the magistrate were not sound. It is true that they went on to observe that should any serious question of identity arises during the course of the trial the ability of the witnesses to identify the accused may be put to tost before the trial. With great respect I do not agree. If a case is posted for trail any test as to the ability or creditability of the witnesses should be decided only in Court and not by means of an identification parade, the proceedings at which will not form part of the record of the Court. 8. In Kanta Prashad Versus Delhi Administration AIR 1958 SC 350, this Court held that failure to hold test identification parade does not make inadmissible the evidence of identification in Court and that the weight to be attached to such identification is a matter for the Courts of fact and it is not for the Supreme Court to reassess the evidence unless exceptional grounds are established necessitating such a course. 9. In State versus Dhanpat AIR 1960 Patna 582 cited before us, it was held that if the witnesses do not give the name of any accused, it is necessary to hold a test identification parade and where a witness gives the name of the accused, ordinarily no such parade is necessary. The Court however said that if any accused hold out a challenge and says that he will not be identified by the witnesses or makes a prayer that he should be put upon a test identification parade, such a parade must always be held in order to meet the challenge. The Court also said that if the accused was arrested on the spot and was in custody from that time upto the date of trial, there could be no question  Page 5 of 9 at all about his identity. 10. A Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court dealt with the entire subject of identification Parade in Ashrafi & Anr. Versus The State 1961 (1) Crl. L. J.340. It was held that the identification of an accused who is already known to the identifier is futile. 11. In Budhsen & Anr. Versus State of U.P. AIR 1970 S.C. 132 it was held that identification parades belong to the investigation stage and generally held with the primary object of enabling the witnesses to identify persons concerned in the offence who were not previously known to them, The legal effect of identification parades was stated as follows: "".....that certain person are brought to jail or some other place and makes statements either express or implied that a certain individuals whom they point out are persons whom they recognized as having been concerned in the crime. They do not constitute substantive evidence"" 12. In Tek Chand Versus State AIR 1965 Punjab 146, cited by learned counsel, a Division Bench of the Punjab High Court held that the accused cannot compel the prosecution to hold their identification during the investigation and there is no law or procedure under which the Magistrate could pass such an order. The Bench proceeded to hold that if such a prayer is made by the accused and the prosecution opposes the same, it exposes the witnesses of identification to a genuine criticism that they would probably not be label to identify the offenders correctly if the parade was held. The Court held that when the request for identification parade was refused for no valid reason and the court identification was made long afterwards, the identification evidence in the court could not be relied on, unless it was a corroborated. 13. In Jadunath Singh Versus State of H.P. AIR 1971 S.C.363 a Bench of Three Judges this Court held that failure to hold test identification of accused is not fatal in all cases. The Bench referred to the case law on the subject including the decision of the Madras High Court in the Sangiah’s case and held as follows: ""It seems to us that the reason given by the pubic prosecutor in the report and the reason given by the Additional District Magistrate (Judicial) in the order directing that identification requested for be not held were not valid. The fact that the chargesheet had been received and the accused had been named by P.Ws was no justification for not having ordered the test identification. But on the facts of this case it is clear that PW2 at least knew that accused from before. As regards PW 3 although he claims to have known the accused, it is clear that his knowledge of the accused was very scant and if had not been for the evidence of PW2 we would not have placed reliance on the evidence of PS 3 in view of the fact that the police did not ask him to identify the appellant. It is stated in Phipson on the Law of Evidence, 9th Ed. P.415d as follows:  Page 6 of 9 ""In criminal cases it is improper to identify the accused only when in the dock: The Police should place him, before hand, with the orders, and ask the witness to pick him out. Nor should the witness e guided in any way, nor asked ""is that the main""?"" We consider that the same is the law in India, if the identify is in doubt. Accordingly on the facts of this case we are of the opinion that the trial was not vitiated because the accused persons were denied identification. The same Bench dealt with the State of U.P. Versus Raju AIR 1971 S.C. 708 and held that in the absence of request from accused, State is not bound to hold identification parade when they were arrested on the spot. 14. In Golam Majibuddin Versus State of West Bengal 1972 Crl. L. J. 1342, another Bench of three Judges of this Court held that when the witness stated that he already knew the accused before the day of occurrence and it was not the case of the accused that he was not known to the witness previously, test identification would serve no purpose. The same Bench had not consider a converse case in ""Rameshwar singh Versus State of J & K AIR 1972 S.C. 102. The Bench stated the law thus: ""Before dealing with the evidence relating to identification of the appellant it may be remembered that the substantive evidence of a witness is his evidence in Court but when the accused person is not previously known to the witness concerned then the identification of the accused by the witness soon after the former’s arrest is of vital importance because it furnishes to investigating agency an assurance that the investigation is proceeding on right line in addition furnishing corroboration of the evidence to be given by the witness later in Court at the trial. From this point of view it is a matter of great importance both for the investigating agency and for the accused and a fortiori for the proper administration of justice that such identification delay after the arrest of the unreasonable delay after the arrest of the accused and that all the necessary precautions and safeguards are effectively taken so that the investigation proceeds on correct line for punishing the real culprit. It would, in addition, be fair to the witness concerned who was a stranger to the accused because in that event the chances of his memory fading are reduced and he is required to identify the alleged culprit a the earliest  Page 7 of 9 possible opportunity after the occurrence. It is thus and thus alone that justice and fair play can be assured both to the accused and to the prosecution. The identification during police investigation, it may be re-called, is not substantive evidence in law and it can only be used for corroborating and contradicting evidence of the witness concerned as given in Court. The identification proceeding, therefore, must be go conducted that the evidence with regard to them when given at the trial, enable the Court safely to form appropriate judicial opinion about its evidentiary value for the purpose of corroborating or contradicting the statement in the Court of the identifying witness."" On the facts of the case, it was found that the name of the accused was not mentioned in the FIR. This Court found the witnesss to be untruthful. This Court found that the High Court had erroneously relied upon statements recorded under Section 161 Cr. P.C. for the purpose of corroboration of certain statement made in Court. On that basis, the judgment of the High Court was set aside and the appellant was acquitted. 15. In Dharamvir Versus State of M.P. (1974) 4 S.C.C. 150, it was held that no identification parade was called for as the victim mentioned the names of the accused in the FIR. 16. In Mahtab Singh versus The State of M.P. (1975) 3 SCC 407 the Bench held that the need for identification parade arises only if the assailants are not previusly known to the witnesses. It is to be noticed that it is the very same Bench which dealt with ""Shri Ram’s case (supra) relied on by the appellant and referred to by us in the beginning. 17. In Harbhajan Singh Versus State of J & K AIR 1975 S.C. 1814 a Bench of Three Judges followed Jadunnath Singh’s case (supra) and held that failure of investigating officer to hold identification parade is not necessarily fatal. 18. In Kanan Versus State of Korala, AIR 1979 S.C. 1127, the Court held that where a witness identifies an accused who is not known to hm in the Court for the first time, his evidence is absolutely valuless unless there has been a previous test identification parade to test his power of observation. 19. In Narendra Singh Versus State of H.P. (1987) 2 S.C.C. 236, the attack on deceased was witnessed by an uninterested and independent witness who knew the accused already. That witness snatched from the accused the Kirpan and the turban when he escaped and deposited the same in the police station. the FIR was lodged within 15 minutes and the accused was named therein. The Court held that the question of identification was of no consequence. 20. In Romesh Kumar Versus State of Punjab, 1993 Crl. L.J. 1800, a Bench of Two Judges held that holding of identification parade was not necessary as the murder took place in the rickshaw and the rickshaw puller stated that the knew the accused and that conviction based primarily on his testimony was proper. 21. On a perusal of the above rulings it is clear that the failure to held the test identification parade even after a  Page 8 of 9 demand by the accused is not always fatal and it is only one of the relevant factors to be taken into consideration alongwith the other evidence on record. if the claim of the ocular witnesss that they knew the accused already is found to be true, the failure to hold a test identification parade is inconsequential. 22. Turning to the facts of this case, it is seen that PW 1 had mentioned the name of the accused in the FIR which was given within 15 minutes of the occurrence. The other two eye witnesses, PW 2 and PW3 also knew the accused previously. The crucial factor is that the accused previously. The crucial factor is that the accused was related to the deceased as a son his ""Sala"" and PW 1 was also related to the deceased. The accused had never denied the relationship. As the trial Judge has observed, "" there is not a scintilla of evidence"" that PW 1 had a grudge against the accused. There is also no evidence that the wife of the deceased had any enmity with the accused. She would not have allowed a false case to be foisted on her brother’s son. The accused was not traceable from 7.4.77 to 13.5.77. On the facts of the case, his application for the test identification parade on his surrender after such a long time does not appear to be bone fide. In any event, the evidence on record as accepted by the Courts below is sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused. Further the point does not seem to have been argued before the trial court or the High Court. On the facts of this case there is no doubt that the failure to hold a test identification parade in spite of an order passed by the Sessions Court is not fatal to the prosecution. 23.

The way in which the deceased was killed shows that the appellant had the intention to commit the offence of murder and accordingly carried out the same. But it is well settled that when the fact of murder has been proved. there is necessity to prove motive. 27. In sum, the appeal has to suffer a dismissal and is accordingly dismissed"
11,Appeal (civil) 2851 of 2005,"Microwave Project, Kota & Anr",Ramesh Chand,18/7/2007,Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT & S.H. KAPADIA,"Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur Bench, dismissing the special leave filed by the appellant. 2. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows: Respondent was engaged as a casual labourer by the Assistant Engineer of the Microwave Project Borabas for the job of fixing of nuts and bolts in the Microwave Tower. After completion of the work and commissioning of the Microwave Towers, respondent was relieved from his job on 1.12.1987. Office of the Microwave, Kota, was also abolished as there was no need of work and in any event it was only of casual nature. Respondent raised a dispute to the effect that there was termination of his services which is illegal. The Labour Ministry, Govt. of India vide order dated 30.9.1991 referred the following dispute under Section 10(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (in short the ’Act’) to the Industrial Tribunal (Central) Kota, Rajasthan. ""Whether the action of the AEN Microwave Project, Kota & LET, Jaipur in terminating the services of Shri Ramesh Chand, S/o Shri Jankidas, Casual Labour under AEN Microwave Project, Kota at Lawatbhata w.e.f. 1.12. 1987 is justified? If not, to what relief the concerned workman is entitled?"" 3. On behalf of the applicant it was pleaded that he had been engaged as casual labourer on 8.12.1986 and, therefore, he having worked for more than 240 days in 12 calendar months could not have been terminated. The appellant took the stand that the respondent was engaged for doing a particular work on a casual labour basis. Since the establishment itself was closed after completion of the work there was no scope for accepting the prayer of the respondent. The Tribunal held that since the respondent worked for 240 days in the establishment of the present appellant, his termination will be bad as there was violation of the mandatory requirements of Section 25-F of the Act. Removal from service amounted to retrenchment under Section 2 (oo) of the Act. With these conclusions it was held that the   of 2 respondent was entitled to be re-employed to continue to be in service along with the 30% back wages. A writ petition was filed before the High Court. A learned Single Judge by a very cryptic order held that the Labour Court has held that there was violation of the requirements of Section 25-F of the Act and, therefore, there was no legality. The Division Bench came to the similar conclusions. 4. In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there is no dispute that the engagement was for a specific project. The Tribunal has categorically noted about these aspects but granted relief to the respondent. It was noted that the office of the present appellant was under the Jaipur Division and the new Kota Division has been created after bifurcation of the Division. 5. In response, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that it should be accepted that the project has been completed, yet in view of the fact that there was bifurcation, the Tribunal was justified in its conclusion. 6. We find that the Tribunal failed to consider the issues in proper perspective. The effect of Section 2(oo)(bb) has been completely lost sight of. There was no dispute that the employment was for a specific project. There was no discussion of the various materials produced before the Tribunal. The orders of the High Court proceeded on the basis that because there was non-compliance with the requirements of Section 25-F, the Award was justified. The question of the applicability of Section 25-F of the Act would be dependent upon the basic question relating to applicability of Section 2(oo)(bb) of the Act. That aspect has been lost sight of. We, therefore, think it appropriate to remit the matter to the Tribunal for fresh consideration. Parties will be permitted to place material in support of their respective stand. As the matter is pending since long, we request the Tribunal to dispose of the matter within a period of four months from the date of receipt of the copy of this judgment. 7.

A learned Single Judge by a very cryptic order held that the Labour Court has held that there was violation of the requirements of Section 25-F of the Act and, therefore, there was no legality. The Division Bench came to the similar conclusions. 4. In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there is no dispute that the engagement was for a specific project. The Tribunal has categorically noted about these aspects but granted relief to the respondent. It was noted that the office of the present appellant was under the Jaipur Division and the new Kota Division has been created after bifurcation of the Division. 5. In response, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that it should be accepted that the project has been completed, yet in view of the fact that there was bifurcation, the Tribunal was justified in its conclusion. 6. We find that the Tribunal failed to consider the issues in proper perspective. The effect of Section 2(oo)(bb) has been completely lost sight of. There was no dispute that the employment was for a specific project. There was no discussion of the various materials produced before the Tribunal. The orders of the High Court proceeded on the basis that because there was non-compliance with the requirements of Section 25-F, the Award was justified. The question of the applicability of Section 25-F of the Act would be dependent upon the basic question relating to applicability of Section 2(oo)(bb) of the Act. That aspect has been lost sight of. We, therefore, think it appropriate to remit the matter to the Tribunal for fresh consideration. Parties will be permitted to place material in support of their respective stand. As the matter is pending since long, we request the Tribunal to dispose of the matter within a period of four months from the date of receipt of the copy of this judgment. 7. Appeal is allowed with no orders as to costs"

CHANDRASEKHARA","CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 37 of 1952. Appeal from the Judgment and Decree dated the 24th September, 1948, of the High Court of Judicature at Madras (Menon and Mack, JJ.) in A.A.O.No. 688 of. 1945 arising out of Judgment and Decree dated the 1st October 1945 of the Court of the’ District Judge of Anantapur in Original Petition No. 15 of 1945. D. Munikanniah (J. B. Dadachandji"" with him) for the appellant. S. P. Sinha(M. O. Chinnappa Reddi and K. B. Chowdhury   of 5 withhim) for the respondents. 1952. October 29. The Judment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J.-The plaintiff filed 0. P. No. 15 of 1945 in the Court of the District Judge of Anantapur for setting aside an award the ground inter alia of legal misconduct of the arbitrator. The trial Court set aside the award. The High Court appeal reversed the judgment of the trial Court and dismissed the plaintiffs suit. This appeal has-been filed by the plaintiff with the certificate of the High Court against that decision. One P.Narayanappa died in 1927 leaving him surviving the plaintiff his widow, the defendant I his undivided brother, the defendant 2 a son -of his another pre-deceased brother, and defedant 3 his son by his pre- deceased wife. ’The deceased had purported to make a will dated 1st May, 1927 under which he had made certain provision -for her maintenance , and residence, The plaintiff stayed with the family for 121 some time but had to leave the family house owing to disputes which arose between her and the senior wife of defendant 1. She lived with her mother for eleven years and ultimately filed a suit in forma pauperis 0. S. No. 19 of 1943 in the Court of the District Judge of Anantapur, for maintenance, arrears of maintenance, residence and household utensils as also recovery of some jewels and clothes as her stridhanam properties. The defendants contested the claim of the plaintiff contending that sufficient arrangement bad been made for her maintenance and residence under the will dated the 1st May, 1927, that she had accordingly been in possession and enjoyment of the property and that her claim was unsustainable. The defendants also denied her claim for jewels and clothes. The suit came for hearing and final disposal before the Subordinate Judge of-Anantapur. When the plaintiff was being examined as P.W. 1, in the suit the 27th February, 1945, all the parties filed a petition under section 21 of the Arbitration Act agreeing to appoint Sri Konakondla Rayalla Govindappa Garu as the ’sole arbitrator’ for settling the disputes in the suit and to abide by his decision, and asking the Court to send the plaint, written statement and other records to the arbitrator for his decision. A reference to arbitration was accordingly made by the Court. The arbitrator entered upon the reference and the 6th March, 1945, examined the plaintiff and got from her a statement which is Exhibit No. 4 in the record. He similarly examined the defendant I the 10th March, 1945, and got from him the statement which is Exhibit No. 5 in the record. After obtaining the two statements, the arbitrator made and published his award the 12th March, 1945. It was this award that was challenged by the plaintiff. The legal misconduct which was alleged against the arbitrator was that he examined each party in the absence of the other. It was contended behalf of 122 the plaintiff that even though the petition for reference to arbitration as also the statements Exhibits Nos. 4 & 5 authorised the arbitrator to settle the disputes according to law after perusing the plaint and the written statements, the arbitrator examined defendant I in the absence of the plaintiff and also perused what was called the settlement of the 1st May, 1927, without giving an opportunity to the plaintiff to have her say in the matter and was thus guilty of legal misconduct. It was contended the other hand by  Page 3 of 5 the defendants that what was done by the arbitrator was merely to obtain from the parties a reiteration of their request contained in the petition that he should give his award the basis of the pleadings, that not a single fact was recorded by the arbitrator from the defendant 1 which did not find a place in his written statement and that therefore the arbitrator was not guilty of legal misconduct. The petition filed by the parties the 27th February, 1915,did not give any special powers to the arbitrator. The arbitrator was appointed for settling the disputes in the suit and the parties agreed to abide by his decision. The plaint, the written, statement and the other records were agreed to be sent to him for his decision, and if the arbitrator was thus directed to make his award after perusing the plaint and the written statements which were give to him by the Court along with the order, we do not see why the arbitrator went to the plaintiff and defendant 1 and recorded their statements. The statement given by the plaintiff to the arbitrator did not mention anything beyond the request that be should peruse the plaint and written statement and give his decision according to law and justice. The statement which was obtained from the defendant 1 however did not merely repeat this request but contained several statements of facts, which did not find a place in his written statement. These statements were as follows: (1)""She felt glad with what was given to her by her husband."" 123 (2)""It is seen from the Government accounts that as per the settlement made by her husband, the lands given to her have been in her possession."" (3)""Just like the plaintiff has her jewels in her possession, the other females in the house have their jewels in their respective possession only. The undivided family has no manner of right therein."" and (4) ""Considering the domestic circumstances our elder brother provided maintenance for the third wife, the plaintiff, just as he had provided maintenance for his second wife."" These statements constituted evidence given by the defendant I in addition to the averments contained in his written statement and it is futile for the defendant 1 to contend that in obtaining the statement Exhibit No. 5 from him the arbitrator merely obtained from him a narration of what was already found in his written statement: This position is confirmed when one turns to the award. The arbitrator stated that the Court had directed him to make the award after perusing the plaint and the written statements of the plaintiff and the defendants and that it had given him the plaint and the written statements along with the order. He however proceeded to state that in pursuance of -the order he took statements from the plaintiff as well as the defendant I who was the manager of the defendant’s family. He further stated that he bad perused the settlement which the defendant 1 alleged as having been made Ist May, 1927, in favour of the plaintiff and proceeded to award to the plaintiff 8 acres 17 cents of land bearing Survey No. 507 in addition to the 40 acres of land already given by the deceased to her. It is clear from the terms of this award that the arbitrator took into consideration not only the plaint and the written statements of the parties but also the statement which he had obtained from the defendant I and the will dated 1st May, 1927. There is thus no doubt that the arbitrator heard the  Page 4 of 5 defendant 1 in the absence of the, plaintiff. No 124 notice of this hearing was given by the arbitrator to the plaintiff nor had she an opportunity of having the evidence of the defendant I taken in her presence so that she could suggest cross-examination or herself cross-examine the defendant I and also be able to find evidence, if she could, that would meet and answer the evidence given by the defendant 1. As was, observed by Lord Langdale M. R. in Harvey v. Shelton(1), ""It is so ordinary a principle in the administration of justice, that no party to a cause can be allowed to use any means whatsoever to influence the mind of the Judge, which means are not known to and capable of being met and resisted by the, other party, that it is impossible, for a moment, not to see, that this was an extremely indiscreet mode of proceeding, to say the very least of it., It is contrary to every principle to allow of such a thing, and I Wholly deny the difference which is alleged to exist between mercantile arbitrations and legal arbitrations. The first principles of justice must be equally applied in every case. Except in the few cases where exceptions are unavoidable, both sides must be heard and each in the presence of the other. In every case in which matters are litigated, you must attend to the representations made both sides, and you must not, in the administration of justice, in whatever form, whether in the regularly constituted Courts or in arbitrations, whether before lawyers or merchants, permit one side to use means of influencing the conduct and the decisions of the Judge, which means are not known to the other side. This case of Harvey v. Shelton(1) is the leading case this point and it has been followed not only in England but in India. (See Ganesh Narayan Singh v. Malida Koer(2). She had also no opportunity to have her say in the matter of the settlement of the 1st May, 1927. The course of proceeding adopted by the arbitrator was obviously contrary to the principles of ,natural justice. (i) (1844) 7 Beav 455 at P. 462. (2) (1911) 13 c.L. J. 399 at pages 401, 402, 125 Shri S. P. Sinha however urged before us that no prejudice was caused to the plaintiff by reason of the arbitrator having obtained the statement Exhibit No. 5 from defendant 1 and that therefore the arbitrator was not guilty of legal misconduct. This contention is unsound. The arbitrator may be a most respectable man; but even so, his conduct cannot be reconciled to general principles. ""A Judge must not take upon himself to say, whether evidence improperly admitted had or had not an effect upon his mind The award may have done perfect justice: but upon general principles it cannot be supported."" Per Lord Eldon, Lord Chancellor, in Walker v. Frobisher(1). To the same effect are the observations of Lord Justice Knight Bruce in Haigh v. Haigh(1): ""It is true that he states in his affidavit that he did not allow those explanations to influence him in -his report upon the accounts, and I have no doubt he honestly intended this to be the case; but it is impossible to gauge the influence which such statements have upon the mind. We must hold, without meaning the least reflection the arbitrator, that he was guilty of legal misconduct and that was sufficient to vitiate the award. Shri S. P. Sinha then urged that the plaintiff had waived her right if any to challenge the award the ground of legal misconduct. No waiver however was pleaded by the  Page 5 of 5 defendant I and it was not competent to him to urge this contention at this stage before us. The result therefore is that the judgment of the High Court cannot stand.

13,Appeal (civil) 7999 of 2002,District Rehabilitation Officer & Ors,Jay Kishore Maity & Ors.,10/11/2006,S.B. Sinha & Dalveer Bhandari,"J U D G M E N T WITH Civil Appeal Nos. 4313-4319 of 2003 S.B. Sinha, J. Union of India filed a Scheme for Rehabilitation of the disabled people. The project started with financial assistance of Central Government/Union of India. The full financial assistance was extended till 1993, whereafter only 50% of financial assistance was provided for by the Central Government. The Union of India, however, took up the entire financial burden for the project with effect from 31.1.1998. Pilot projects were started under which centres were established in several States of the country with a view to identify the services required by the disabled population, to assist the man power required for delivering those services to them or to work out the modalities for the types of man power etc. One of such centres was established in Kharagpur in the State of West Bengal and another in the district of Mysore in the State of Karnataka. For the purpose of execution of the said projects, a Project Coordination Committee was constituted. A set of detailed guidelines were circulated. The Project Coordinator would be the main agency to implement the Project and would function through Member Secretary of the State Level Advisory Committee. The Scheme dated 3.1.1983 was circulated with the concerned State Governments by the Joint Secretary of the Union of India. The total package of services for the disabled starting with awareness in the community and ending with their economic rehabilitation was to contain with the following elements: ""1) Creation of community awareness about the disabled population in order to seek community participation in the measures for the welfare of the disabled. 2) parent counseling about the home care and management of the disabled child. 3) promote dissemination of information on prevention, early detection and possibilities of treatment of the disabled. 4) arrangements for screening of disabilities and early referrals. 5) arrangements for physical rehabilitation including medical or surgical intervention. 6) integration of disabled children in normal schools schedule and establishment or special schools wherever necessary. 7) provision of vocational training for the disabled. 8) employment guidance and placement services both in integrated as well as sheltered conditions of the   of 6 disabled."" The category of employees found suitable for recruitment for the project were: (i) Community Health Workers; and (2) Anganwari Workers. The Scheme envisaged that the Pilot Scheme with the infrastructure provided should be utilized by the State Governments with an intent to continue the project. The infrastructures created for these pilot projects was expected to prove to be useful for training the required manpower for future pilot projects and similar centres which the State Governments may like to establish. The Project Coordinators of the Rehabilitation Centres were the officers of the State Governments of States of West Bengal and Karnataka. They selected the employees for the said Rehabilitation Centres. The employees were offered a salary of Rs. 660/- in the scale of Rs.660-60-1100 50-5600. Indisputably they have been working for a long time. Initially as noticed hereinbefore, although funds were provided by an outside agency, the same have been taken over by the Central Government. Terms and conditions of service of the employees appointed were governed by the rules applicable to the employees of the State Governments. The pay-scales applicable to employees of the State Government were also applied to their case. The employees, however, filed Original Applications before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta as also Karnataka at Bangalore, inter alia, contending that they being the employees of the Central Government, the terms and conditions of services applicable to the Central Government should apply in their case also. A preliminary objection was taken as regards of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the premise that the applicants were the employees of the State Governments. By a judgment and order dated 14.7.2000, the Tribunal held: ""12...So we are, therefore, of the clear opinion that applicants were appointed by the Project Officer for and on behalf of the Central Government and the Central Government had direct control over the DRC and fund is being provided by Central Government and we are satisfied from facts that the prima facie it is for determination of the relationship between the employer and the employee which is in existence in this case; Central Government is employer of the applicants and the employees are entitled to claim to be employees of the Central Government. In view of the aforesaid circumstances, we find that there cannot be any dispute in this case that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the grievance of the applicants who were directly appointed and being controlled by the Central Government. It is true that the aforesaid applicants are getting the pay and allowances as per rate prescribed by the Govt. of West Bengal. It is found that the scale prescribed by the government of West Bengal has been adopted by the concerned authorities under the scheme. So, were adoption of the scale of the State Government does not disentitle the applicants the right of status of the Central Government employees under the scheme. 13. In view of the aforesaid circumstances we are of the view that the applicants are the employees of the Central Government though their salary is being paid as per scale of the State Government. Under the circumstances stated above, we allow the application with a direction upon the respondents to treat the aforesaid applicants as employees of the Central Government and to grant the relief’s to the applicants in accordance with the rules in respect of salary, provident fund etc. with immediate effect. No cost."" A writ petition filed thereagainst by Appellants herein has been  Page 3 of 6 dismissed by a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court by reason of the impugned order. The Division Bench although noticed the pleadings of the parties as also the submissions made at the bar at great details, but merely held: ""We have carefully considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties and we are inclined to agree with the findings of the learned Tribunal regarding the status of the private respondents herein. The Scheme for setting up the Pilot Projects for the District Rehabilitation Centres amply demonstrate that the same was a Scheme of the Ministry of Social Welfare, Government of India, and the State Government was merely the implementing agency through its officers of the Social Welfare Directorate. The entire funding and recruitment process and the manner of functioning, as provided for in the Scheme, is under the direct control of the Central Government, and even the State Level Advisory Committee, which was to be chaired by the Secretary of the Social Welfare Department, was required to send periodical reports of the functioning of the District Rehabilitation Centre to the Central Government."" Mr. Doabia, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Appellant, inter alia, contended that keeping in view the scheme floated by the Central Government, the manner in which the funds were secured and implementation of the scheme that took place, it is evident that Respondents were the employees of the State of West Bengal and State of Karnataka respectively. It was submitted that in any event as the project has been wound up from 1st April, 2006 and no budgetary provisions therefor having been made for payment of salaries to the employees, this Court should pass an appropriate order. It was urged that the Central Administrative Tribunal as also the High Court applied wrong tests in determining the relationship of ‘Employer and Employee and failed to consider that effective control over the employees was with the State Governments and not the Central Government. Mr. Doabia has also pointed out that some of the State Governments e.g. State of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu have taken similar projects on their own. Mr. Jaideep Gupta and Mr. P. Vishwanath Shetty, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the State of West Bengal and State of Karnataka, on the other hand, supported the impugned judgments. They, moreover, appealed that having regard to the number of years Respondents had served in the projects, the Scheme should either be directed to be continued or the employees be directed to be absorbed either by the Central Government or by the State Governments of West Bengal Karnataka, as the case may be. By an order dated 13.9.2006, we recorded as under:- ""A statement has been made by Mr. T.S. Doabia, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Union that the Central Government has stopped releasing any fund from 1.4.2006. On a query made by us in that behalf it was stated at the Bar that so far as the employees of the State of West Bengal are concerned, they have been paid salary up to July 2006 and so far as the employees working in the State of Karnataka are concerned, they have been paid their salary up to August 2006. We have been given to understand that the salary to the respondents herein could be disbursed by the Council only from the excess fund available with it from the last  Page 4 of 6 years’ budget and the amount now stands exhausted in view of stoppage of the grant by the Central Government. We direct the State of Karnataka as also the State of West Bengal to state on oath as to whether they would like to continue with the projects in lieu of the scheme as has been done by the States of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. Learned counsel for the Central Government shall hand over a copy of the project adopted by the State of Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan or Chhattisgarh, as the case may be, to Mr. Tapash Ray, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State of West Bengal and Mr. Sanjay Hegde, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Karnataka so as to enable them to seek instructions as to whether their States are prepared to continue with the said projects on the terms adopted by the said States. We would also direct the Government of India to file an affidavit as to what steps, if any, are feasible to be taken by it for continuation of the project at least for some time more so that solution of the problem may be found out by this Court in the meanwhile in the event the States express their inability to continue with the existing project. We also direct the respondents to file affidavit(s) stating as to whether they are ready and willing to serve other projects run by the Central Government, in the event the Government of West Bengal and Government on the other are not ready and willing to continue with the projects. The directors of Social Welfare Department of the State of West Bengal as also the State of Karnataka would also file a status report as regards the project by 26.9.2006."" Pursuant to the said direction, the Director of Social Welfare as also the Secretaries of the Social Welfare Departments of the States of West Bengal and Karnataka have filed their respective status reports. According to the respective State Governments, they are not in a position to take over the project. It was urged that the State Governments run other projects and also provide adequate funds to Non-Governmental Organisations which have been working in the field and the projects should, thus, be directed to be continued by the Central Government only. In its counter-affidavit, the State of West Bengal, inter alia, contended that the Central Government has been running four other projects in the District of Midnapore. The State Governments has other projects for which budgetary provisions to the extent of Rs. 6 crores per annum have been made and thus in view of the acute financial constraints, continuation of the projects like the present one would not serve any purpose. An affidavit has also been filed by the State of Karnataka almost to the same effect. The Parliament enacted the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. The Act was enacted to give effect to the proclamation on the full participation and equality of people with disabilities on both Central and State Governments. Implementation of its provisions is the primary responsibility of the State Governments. The projects were started at different centres in different States by the Central Governments by way of a Scheme. The funds for the said projects initially came from the Central Government. The purpose of a pilot project has been noticed by us hereinbefore. The control of the Rehabilitation Centres for the benefit of the people for whom the same were started was with the concerned State Governments. The employees do not become the employees of the Central Government only because the project was conceived by it or it used to give  Page 5 of 6 directions from time to time. The tests which are determinative for ascertaining the relationship of ‘Employer and Employee’ are well known viz. functional test or control test or organisational test etc. For determination of relationship of the employer and the employees, separate tests may have to be applied having regard to the factual matrix involved in each case. The parties did not adduce any oral evidence before the Central Administrative Tribunal. The Central Administrative Tribunal although referred to some of the decisions of this Court, but without applying them, opined that Respondents are the employees of the Central Government. No reason has been assigned therefor. No analysis of the available materials was made. The question has been considered by this Court in Workmen of Nilgiri Coop. Mkt. Society v. State of T.N. and Others [(2004) 3 SCC 514], wherein it has been held: ""Determination of the vexed questions as to whether a contract is a contract of service or contract for service and whether the employees concerned are employees of the contractors has never been an easy task. No decision of this Court has laid down any hard and fast rule nor is it possible to do so. The question in each case has to be answered having regard to the fact involved therein. No single test \026 be it control test, be it organization or any other test \026 has been held to be the determinative factor for determining the jural relationship of employer and employee."" [See also Haldia Refinery Canteen Employees Union and Others v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. and Others 2005 (5) SCC 51]. In State of Karnataka and Others v. KGSD Canteen Empoyees’ Welfare Assn. and Others [(2006) 1 SCC 567], this Court held: ""We, however, intend to point out that in a case of this nature even an industrial adjudicator may have some difficulty in coming to the conclusion that employees of a canteen for all intent and purport are employees of the principal employer."" We, therefore, with respect, are unable to agree with the findings of the Central Administrative Tribunal as also the Division Bench of the High Court. A question has arisen as to whether the employees are the employees of the State of West Bengal or the District Rehabilitation Centres. In view of the order proposed to be passed by us, it may not be adverted to at this state as we are of the opinion that the projects should be continued by the State of West Bengal and the State of Karnataka as the case may be. Even if the States think it fit to close down the project, the services of the employees working in the rehabilitation centres should be continued. In a case of this nature, however, we think it expedient to invoke our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. The Central Government has categorically stated that those employees who would opt for employment under the Central Government may be accommodated in its ongoing projects. Pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof, the concerned employees who have affirmed affidavits showing inclination to serve any project under the Central Government, may be absorbed by it. Services of those employees may be utilized by the Central Government in any of its project. They would, however, be continued to be paid salaries on the same scale of pay. Their experience may also be considered for the purpose of determination of their seniority, subject of course to any rule which is in operation in the field. All other financial benefits including those of superannuatory benefits should be protected. It is, however, clarified that such employment under the Central Government would be temporary and  Page 6 of 6 personal posts which would come to an end with the retirement of the concerned employees. Similarly those Respondents who have opted for their employment with the State of West Bengal or the State of Karnataka, as the case may be would be absorbed by the States of West Bengal and Karnataka, as the case may be, on the same terms and conditions as referred to hereinbefore. Keeping in view the nature of order passed by us, it is clarified that the same shall not be treated as a precedent. We also make it clear that these orders have been passed by us keeping the stand taken by the parties. These appeals are disposed of with the aforementioned directions. There shall be no order as to costs","J U D G M E N T WITH Civil Appeal Nos. 4313-4319 of 2003 S.B. Sinha, J. Union of India filed a Scheme for Rehabilitation of the disabled people. The project started with financial assistance of Central Government/Union of India. The full financial assistance was extended till 1993, whereafter only 50% of financial assistance was provided for by the Central Government. The Union of India, however, took up the entire financial burden for the project with effect from 31.1.1998. Pilot projects were started under which centres were established in several States of the country with a view to identify the services required by the disabled population, to assist the man power required for delivering those services to them or to work out the modalities for the types of man power etc. One of such centres was established in Kharagpur in the State of West Bengal and another in the district of Mysore in the State of Karnataka. For the purpose of execution of the said projects, a Project Coordination Committee was constituted. A set of detailed guidelines were circulated. The Project Coordinator would be the main agency to implement the Project and would function through Member Secretary of the State Level Advisory Committee. The Scheme dated 3.1.1983 was circulated with the concerned State Governments by the Joint Secretary of the Union of India. The total package of services for the disabled starting with awareness in the community and ending with their economic rehabilitation was to contain with the following elements: ""1) Creation of community awareness about the disabled population in order to seek community participation in the measures for the welfare of the disabled. 2) parent counseling about the home care and management of the disabled child. 3) promote dissemination of information on prevention, early detection and possibilities of treatment of the disabled. 4) arrangements for screening of disabilities and early referrals. 5) arrangements for physical rehabilitation including medical or surgical intervention. 6) integration of disabled children in normal schools schedule and establishment or special schools wherever necessary. 7) provision of vocational training for the disabled. 8) employment guidance and placement services both in integrated as well as sheltered conditions of the   of 6 disabled."" The category of employees found suitable for recruitment for the project were: (i) Community Health Workers; and (2) Anganwari Workers. The Scheme envisaged that the Pilot Scheme with the infrastructure provided should be utilized by the State Governments with an intent to continue the project. The infrastructures created for these pilot projects was expected to prove to be useful for training the required manpower for future pilot projects and similar centres which the State Governments may like to establish. The Project Coordinators of the Rehabilitation Centres were the officers of the State Governments of States of West Bengal and Karnataka. They selected the employees for the said Rehabilitation Centres. The employees were offered a salary of Rs. 660/- in the scale of Rs.660-60-1100 50-5600. Indisputably they have been working for a long time. Initially as noticed hereinbefore, although funds were provided by an outside agency, the same have been taken over by the Central Government. Terms and conditions of service of the employees appointed were governed by the rules applicable to the employees of the State Governments. The pay-scales applicable to employees of the State Government were also applied to their case. The employees, however, filed Original Applications before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta as also Karnataka at Bangalore, inter alia, contending that they being the employees of the Central Government, the terms and conditions of services applicable to the Central Government should apply in their case also. A preliminary objection was taken as regards of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the premise that the applicants were the employees of the State Governments. By a judgment and order dated 14.7.2000, the Tribunal held: ""12...So we are, therefore, of the clear opinion that applicants were appointed by the Project Officer for and on behalf of the Central Government and the Central Government had direct control over the DRC and fund is being provided by Central Government and we are satisfied from facts that the prima facie it is for determination of the relationship between the employer and the employee which is in existence in this case; Central Government is employer of the applicants and the employees are entitled to claim to be employees of the Central Government. In view of the aforesaid circumstances, we find that there cannot be any dispute in this case that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the grievance of the applicants who were directly appointed and being controlled by the Central Government. It is true that the aforesaid applicants are getting the pay and allowances as per rate prescribed by the Govt. of West Bengal. It is found that the scale prescribed by the government of West Bengal has been adopted by the concerned authorities under the scheme. So, were adoption of the scale of the State Government does not disentitle the applicants the right of status of the Central Government employees under the scheme. 13. In view of the aforesaid circumstances we are of the view that the applicants are the employees of the Central Government though their salary is being paid as per scale of the State Government. Under the circumstances stated above, we allow the application with a direction upon the respondents to treat the aforesaid applicants as employees of the Central Government and to grant the relief’s to the applicants in accordance with the rules in respect of salary, provident fund etc. with immediate effect. No cost."" A writ petition filed thereagainst by Appellants herein has been  Page 3 of 6 dismissed by a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court by reason of the impugned order. The Division Bench although noticed the pleadings of the parties as also the submissions made at the bar at great details, but merely held: ""We have carefully considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties and we are inclined to agree with the findings of the learned Tribunal regarding the status of the private respondents herein. The Scheme for setting up the Pilot Projects for the District Rehabilitation Centres amply demonstrate that the same was a Scheme of the Ministry of Social Welfare, Government of India, and the State Government was merely the implementing agency through its officers of the Social Welfare Directorate. The entire funding and recruitment process and the manner of functioning, as provided for in the Scheme, is under the direct control of the Central Government, and even the State Level Advisory Committee, which was to be chaired by the Secretary of the Social Welfare Department, was required to send periodical reports of the functioning of the District Rehabilitation Centre to the Central Government."" Mr. Doabia, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Appellant, inter alia, contended that keeping in view the scheme floated by the Central Government, the manner in which the funds were secured and implementation of the scheme that took place, it is evident that Respondents were the employees of the State of West Bengal and State of Karnataka respectively. It was submitted that in any event as the project has been wound up from 1st April, 2006 and no budgetary provisions therefor having been made for payment of salaries to the employees, this Court should pass an appropriate order. It was urged that the Central Administrative Tribunal as also the High Court applied wrong tests in determining the relationship of ‘Employer and Employee and failed to consider that effective control over the employees was with the State Governments and not the Central Government. Mr. Doabia has also pointed out that some of the State Governments e.g. State of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu have taken similar projects on their own. Mr. Jaideep Gupta and Mr. P. Vishwanath Shetty, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the State of West Bengal and State of Karnataka, on the other hand, supported the impugned judgments. They, moreover, appealed that having regard to the number of years Respondents had served in the projects, the Scheme should either be directed to be continued or the employees be directed to be absorbed either by the Central Government or by the State Governments of West Bengal Karnataka, as the case may be. By an order dated 13.9.2006, we recorded as under:- ""A statement has been made by Mr. T.S. Doabia, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Union that the Central Government has stopped releasing any fund from 1.4.2006. On a query made by us in that behalf it was stated at the Bar that so far as the employees of the State of West Bengal are concerned, they have been paid salary up to July 2006 and so far as the employees working in the State of Karnataka are concerned, they have been paid their salary up to August 2006. We have been given to understand that the salary to the respondents herein could be disbursed by the Council only from the excess fund available with it from the last  Page 4 of 6 years’ budget and the amount now stands exhausted in view of stoppage of the grant by the Central Government. We direct the State of Karnataka as also the State of West Bengal to state on oath as to whether they would like to continue with the projects in lieu of the scheme as has been done by the States of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. Learned counsel for the Central Government shall hand over a copy of the project adopted by the State of Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan or Chhattisgarh, as the case may be, to Mr. Tapash Ray, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State of West Bengal and Mr. Sanjay Hegde, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Karnataka so as to enable them to seek instructions as to whether their States are prepared to continue with the said projects on the terms adopted by the said States. We would also direct the Government of India to file an affidavit as to what steps, if any, are feasible to be taken by it for continuation of the project at least for some time more so that solution of the problem may be found out by this Court in the meanwhile in the event the States express their inability to continue with the existing project. We also direct the respondents to file affidavit(s) stating as to whether they are ready and willing to serve other projects run by the Central Government, in the event the Government of West Bengal and Government on the other are not ready and willing to continue with the projects. The directors of Social Welfare Department of the State of West Bengal as also the State of Karnataka would also file a status report as regards the project by 26.9.2006."" Pursuant to the said direction, the Director of Social Welfare as also the Secretaries of the Social Welfare Departments of the States of West Bengal and Karnataka have filed their respective status reports. According to the respective State Governments, they are not in a position to take over the project. It was urged that the State Governments run other projects and also provide adequate funds to Non-Governmental Organisations which have been working in the field and the projects should, thus, be directed to be continued by the Central Government only.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur Bench, dismissing the special leave filed by the appellant. 2. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows: Respondent was engaged as a casual labourer by the Assistant Engineer of the Microwave Project Borabas for the job of fixing of nuts and bolts in the Microwave Tower. After completion of the work and commissioning of the Microwave Towers, respondent was relieved from his job on 1.12.1987. Office of the Microwave, Kota, was also abolished as there was no need of work and in any event it was only of casual nature. Respondent raised a dispute to the effect that there was termination of his services which is illegal. The Labour Ministry, Govt. of India vide order dated 30.9.1991 referred the following dispute under Section 10(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (in short the ’Act’) to the Industrial Tribunal (Central) Kota, Rajasthan. ""Whether the action of the AEN Microwave Project, Kota & LET, Jaipur in terminating the services of Shri Ramesh Chand, S/o Shri Jankidas, Casual Labour under AEN Microwave Project, Kota at Lawatbhata w.e.f. 1.12. 1987 is justified? If not, to what relief the concerned workman is entitled?"" 3. On behalf of the applicant it was pleaded that he had been engaged as casual labourer on 8.12.1986 and, therefore, he having worked for more than 240 days in 12 calendar months could not have been terminated. The appellant took the stand that the respondent was engaged for doing a particular work on a casual labour basis. Since the establishment itself was closed after completion of the work there was no scope for accepting the prayer of the respondent. The Tribunal held that since the respondent worked for 240 days in the establishment of the present appellant, his termination will be bad as there was violation of the mandatory requirements of Section 25-F of the Act. Removal from service amounted to retrenchment under Section 2 (oo) of the Act. With these conclusions it was held that the   of 2 respondent was entitled to be re-employed to continue to be in service along with the 30% back wages. A writ petition was filed before the High Court. A learned Single Judge by a very cryptic order held that the Labour Court has held that there was violation of the requirements of Section 25-F of the Act and, therefore, there was no legality. The Division Bench came to the similar conclusions. 4. In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there is no dispute that the engagement was for a specific project. The Tribunal has categorically noted about these aspects but granted relief to the respondent. It was noted that the office of the present appellant was under the Jaipur Division and the new Kota Division has been created after bifurcation of the Division. 5. In response, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that it should be accepted that the project has been completed, yet in view of the fact that there was bifurcation, the Tribunal was justified in its conclusion. 6. We find that the Tribunal failed to consider the issues in proper perspective. The effect of Section 2(oo)(bb) has been completely lost sight of. There was no dispute that the employment was for a specific project. There was no discussion of the various materials produced before the Tribunal. The orders of the High Court proceeded on the basis that because there was non-compliance with the requirements of Section 25-F, the Award was justified. The question of the applicability of Section 25-F of the Act would be dependent upon the basic question relating to applicability of Section 2(oo)(bb) of the Act. That aspect has been lost sight of. We, therefore, think it appropriate to remit the matter to the Tribunal for fresh consideration. Parties will be permitted to place material in support of their respective stand.

15,Appeal (crl.) 367 of 2005,Bhimapa Chandappa Hosamani and others,State of Karnataka,20/09/2006,B.P. SINGH & ALTAMAS KABIR,"B.P. Singh, J. The appellants have appealed to this Court by special leave against their conviction and sentence passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore on 26th May, 2004 in Criminal Appeal No. 1485 of 1998. The appellants were charged of the offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code for having committed the murder of Lakshman at about 6.00 a.m. on May 30, 1996 while he was sleeping on the ’katta’ of his house. The Principal Sessions Judge, Bijapur, who tried the appellants in Sessions Case No.144 of 1998 acquitted them of the charge by his judgment and order of September 14, 1998. The trial Court held that out of the four witnesses examined as eye witnesses, two, namely- PW.8 and PW.9 turned hostile and did not support the case of the prosecution. The remaining two witnesses were PW-1, Smt. Nimbavva, mother of the deceased and PW-2, Ayyappa, the younger brother of the deceased, aged about 12 years. On an appreciation of their evidence the trial court held that PW-2 had not really witnessed the occurrence while PW-1 was not a truthful witness. The High Court on re appreciation of the evidence on record came to the contrary conclusion that PWs. 1 and 2 were truthful eye-witnesses and on the basis of their evidence the appellants could be safely convicted of the offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC. Accordingly the appellants were sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life. The case of the prosecution is that on May 30, 1996 the deceased was sleeping on the ’katta’in the outer portion of the house by the side of the road, while the remaining members of the family were sleeping inside. According to PW-1 on May 30, 1996 her husband Basappa, PW-3 woke up at about 5.00 a.m. since he had to go to Muddebihal. PW-1 and PW-2 also woke up with him. PW-3 wanted the deceased to accompany him to Muddebihal but he insisted on sleeping and stated that he will come to Muddebihal with food by 9 O’ clock bus. While PW-3 left for Muddebihal, she started washing utensils at a place which was at a distance of about 2 meters from the ’katta’ where the deceased was sleeping. There is evidence on record to the effect that at about 5.00 a.m. it was dark but at about 6.00 a.m. there was some light as the sun was about to rise. At about that time she noticed the three accused variously armed coming there. While appellant No.2 was armed with an axe the other two were armed with ’Jambiya’. They came saying that they will finish the deceased. In spite of her begging of them not to do so, they started assaulting the deceased. She saw that appellant No.2 gave 2 or 3 blows on the neck of the deceased while the remaining two assaulted him with their weapons on different parts of the body. According to her, the occurrence was witnessed by her younger son, PW-2 and PWs. 8 and   of 6 9, the neighbours, who had come on hearing her cries. According to her a police havaldar came to her house after about 4-5 hours and recorded the information given by her. At about 12 noon an Inspector came who held inquest over the dead body of the deceased and took other steps in the course of investigation. The dead body of the deceased was then sent for post-mortem examination. In the First Information Report lodged by PW-1, it was stated that about 3 months before the date of occurrence, her son Lakshman, the deceased, who had illicit connection with Renuka (sister of appellant No.2) was seen following Renuka while she was going to wash clothes to the village ’nallah’. People of village had seen him following Renuka and with a view to protect her reputation Renuka complained to her mother and mother-in-law about the deceased dragging her. Thereafter the mother and mother-in-law of Renuka had come to her house and abused the deceased in filthy language. From that day onwards the appellants were moving about in the village saying that the deceased had insulted their sister and, therefore, they will not spare him and will finish him. In this background the occurrence took place on May 30, 1996. It is stated that her husband got up at 5.00 a.m. in the morning since he had to go to Muddebihal . She tried to wake up her son (deceased) but he insisted on sleeping since it was dark and said that he will get up after sun rise. She thereafter started sweeping and washing utensils. At about 6.00 a.m. the appellants came and finding her son sleeping on the ’katta’ said that they will not spare Lakshman (deceased). So saying, appellant No.2 assaulted the deceased on his neck twice or thrice with an axe while the remaining accused assaulted him with ’Jambiyas’ on his back and thigh. Her son died on the spot. They then ran away saying that they had finished Lakshman. She further stated in the FIR that her mother-in-law and her son PW-2 came out and witnessed the occurrence. PWs-8 and 9 of the neighborhood also witnessed the assault. It was alleged that out of anger and to take revenge for her son having illicit connection with Renuka, the appellants had committed the murder of her son. The evidence on record discloses that all the three appellants are the neighbours of PW.1. Since PWs. 8 and 9 did not support the case of the prosecution, they were declared hostile. Their evidence was, therefore, of no assistance to the prosecution. Apart from the mother, PW-1, the other witness PW-2 was the younger brother of the deceased. The trial court came to the conclusion that he was not an eye witness and, therefore, placed no reliance on his testimony. The High Court dis agreed with the trial court and held that PW-2, in clear terms, claimed in his examination in-chief that he had witnessed the incident and had seen all the accused assaulting the deceased with their respective weapons. The High Court observed that even in his cross examination no material contradiction had been elicited and PW-2 had denied the suggestion that he had not witnesses the incident. What PW-2 stated was that he came from inside the house when his mother PW-1 shouted and by the time he came the assault was over. The High Court was of the view that since PW-1 in her evidence stated that she shouted when the assault was going on and at that time, hearing her shouts her neighbours PWs. 8 and 9 had come, it was but natural that PW-2, who was inside the house would have also come out and witnessed the incident. There was thus no reason to doubt the testimony of PW-2. We have carefully examined the evidence of PW-2. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that on a mere reading of the evidence it is quite clear that PW-2 is not an eye witness. In all likelihood he was sleeping inside the house and when he came out of the house later, he only saw the dead body of the deceased. He cannot, therefore, be said to be an eye witness. PW-2 stated that on the date of the incident he was sleeping inside the house with his father, mother and grand-mother. There was  Page 3 of 6 a ’katta’ in the front portion of the house where the deceased was sleeping. In his examination-in-chief he asserted that he woke up early in the morning when his father and mother woke up. His father had to go to Muddebihal and while leaving for Muddebihal he (father) tried to awaken the deceased but the deceased insisted that he will come by 9 O’ clock bus and will bring meals. The deceased again went to sleep. He was then asked by the deceased to bring ’beedi’ which he brought from inside the house. The deceased smoked the ’beedi’ and again went to sleep. When his father left for Muddebihal it was dark. His mother, PW-1, was washing utensils inside the house and at that time he was standing in the front-yard. He saw the appellants coming variously armed and he also witnessed the assault by them on his brother. The appellants after assaulting his brother went away saying that they had finished Lakshman. When the accused had come, his mother PW-1, had begged of them not to assault her son, yet the appellants murdered his brother. When the incident took pace there was light though the sun was not visible. Thereafter the police had come to his house. At about 8.00 a.m. Inspector also came. It appears from his deposition that while his mother was washing utensils he was standing in the front yard of the house and he saw the appellants coming to his house and assaulting his brother. He also saw the mother pleading with them not to assault his brother. This witness in his examination-in-chief asserted that he had seen the entire occurrence from the very begging. In his cross-examination, however, he gave a different version altogether. He stated that when his father left for Muddebihal he did not wake up. He was not even aware as to when his father left, as he was asleep. He stated that on hearing the sound of bowling of his mother he woke up and saw the dead body of his brother. However, he denied the suggestion that he did not see the appellants assaulting his brother. It also appears from the evidence of PW-11, the Investigating Officer, that PW-2 had not stated before him that his father woke up his elder brother and asked him to accompany him but his brother did not go, and went to sleep, and that the accused came to their house. He also did not state about his mother pleading with the accused not to assault her son. In this state of the evidence, we entertain a serious doubt as to whether PW-2 is really an eye witness. In his examination-in-chief he claims to have woken up with his father when he was leaving for Muddebihal. In his cross-examination, his version is to the contrary. He has stated quite clearly that he did not even know when his father left since he was sleeping, and further that when he got up on hearing cries of his mother, the incident was over and on coming out he had seen the dead body of his brother. The evidence leads us to suspect the assertion of PW-2 that he is an eye witness. We are, therefore, inclined to accept the finding of the trial court that PW-2 had not witnessed the occurrence. His evidence cannot be relied upon. We are then left with the evidence of the sole eye witness, namely PW-1, the mother of the deceased. As noticed, in the First Information Report it was clearly stated by PW.1 that there was a motive for the commission of the offence, namely \026 that the deceased had illicit relations with one Renuka and this had come to the knowledge of her family members who had protested against the conduct of the deceased. They had in fact come to the house of PW-1 and abused the deceased in filthy language, and since then the appellants were heard saying that they will not spare the deceased. From her cross-examination, it appears, that she has gone back on her statements made in the First Information Report as also in her examination-in-chief. In fact she denied that she knew about her son having any illicit relations with Renuka. On the other hand she stated that the relationship between the two families was cordial till the date of murder. Prior to the murder of her son there had been no quarrel, complaint or dispute between the accused and her son. The members of the two families used to visit each other.  Page 4 of 6 The trial court as well as the High Court have not accepted the evidence regarding existence of motive as alleged by PW-1 in the First Information Report. In fact she herself in the course of her deposition denied the existence of such a motive. The High Court has agreed with the view of the trial court on this issue. It is well settled that in order to bring home the guilt of an accused, it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove the motive. The existence of motive is only one of the circumstances to be kept in mind while appreciating the evidence adduced by the prosecution. If the evidence of the witnesses appears to be truthful and convincing, failure to prove the motive is not fatal to the case of the prosecution. The law on this aspect is well settled. However, in the instant case we are left with the evidence of a sole eye witness and it therefore, becomes the duty of the Court to critically scrutinize her evidence with a view to assure itself that the witness is stating the truth and that her evidence is so convincing and appears to be so natural and truthful that it is not necessary to look for other evidence to record a conviction. Viewed from this angle, it is established that in the First Information Report, a false statement had been made by PW-1 as to the existence of motive. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the evidence on record will establish that PW-1 is not a truthful witness. In fact after her husband arrived at the scene, a false case was concocted and the appellants were named as the assailants. In her cross-examination, PW-1 stated that after recording her complaint the police officer did not read out the same to her but her thumb mark was taken on the complaint. Her thumb mark was taken five times on five white sheets of paper. After she had lodged the report she was never questioned by police. She, however, denied the suggestion that the police had prepared a false complaint at the behest of her husband. PW-1 admits that she had been made to sign (thumb mark) five blank sheets of paper and that she was never questioned by the police. This is only one of the suspicious circumstances which appears on record. In her First Information Report she had stated that PW-2 had witnessed the occurrence after coming out of the house alongwith her mother-in-law on hearing her cries. In her evidence, however, she gave a different version. She stated that when the appellants came, her son PW-2 was standing in the front yard of the house. Both she and her son pleaded with the appellants not to assault the deceased but they were both pushed by them and the appellants started assaulting the deceased. An improvement has been made by the witness in an attempt to project the presence of PW-2 from the very beginning of the occurrence which, as we have held earlier, is not true. Another aspect of the matter which deserves notice is the fact that neither her clothes nor that of PW-2 had any blood stains, though having regard to the nature of injures of the deceased a lot of blood must have come out. She explained by saying that she only touched the body of the deceased to find out whether he was alive. The conduct, to say the least, appears highly unnatural. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the absence of blood stains on the clothes of PWs.1 and 2 suggests that they had not witnessed the occurrence as they were perhaps inside the house and later when they came out they saw the dead body of the deceased on the ’katta’ with severe injuires. It was submitted that according to PW-2 when the occurrence took place at about 6.00 a.m. the sun had not risen but there was sufficient light to identify the appellants. According to PW-2, his mother PW-1 was washing utensils inside the house. The speed with which the occurrence took place as described by PW-1 is such that she had hardly any time to raise her voice when the accused started assaulting her son. By the time she could raise her voice, the accused had murdered her son and had run away. In the light of these circumstances it was argued before us that while she was inside the house, the murder of her son had taken place outside on the ’katta’ where he was sleeping and the assailants had disappeared after  Page 5 of 6 committing the offence. Her claim, therefore, that she was an eye witness cannot be accepted. There are several circumstances which give rise to a serious doubt about the truthfulness of PW-1. It is the case of the prosecution supported by PW-1 that her husband PW-3 slept inside the house while her deceased son slept outside on the ’katta’. This assertion of PW-1 is again contradicted by her husband PW-3 who stated that on that night he had not slept inside the house. In fact he had slept with his deceased son on the ’katta’. He further stated that he left his son sleeping and washed his face and, untied the cow tethered in front of his house and took the cow for sale to Muddebihal market. There was a pot of water on the ’katta’ where they had slept and he used that water for washing his face. He did not go inside the house. While leaving, he only awakened his wife. It obviously means that without going inside the house he may have awakened his wife by calling her and asking her to wake up. The deposition of PW-1 is to the effect that after her husband left for Muddebihal she started sweeping and cleaning the utensils. The evidence of PW-2, her son, Ayyappa, is that after his father left, his mother started rinsing utensils sitting inside the house and that he was standing in the front yard. The First Information Report is silent where she was washing utensils but in her deposition she clearly asserted that she was washing utensils just about 2 meters by the side of the ’katta’ on which her son, the deceased, was sleeping in the outer portion of the house by the side of the road. The evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 are, therefore, not consistent on this point. Apart from these inconsistencies there is one another aspect of the matter which creates a serious doubt about the truthfulness of the prosecution case. As noticed earlier, PW-10, Havaldar Appanna the Havaldar of Nidagundi Police Out Post was the first person to reach the place of occurrence. He deposed that at about 7.00 a.m. he had received a wireless message from the Circle Police Inspector of Basavan Bagewadi informing him that a murder had taken place in village Areshanker and that he should immediately proceed to the village. The CPI informed him that he would also be reaching there. According to PW-10 he reached the Village Areshanker at about 8.00 or 8.30 a.m. CPI Bagewadi had already reached the village. They questioned PW-1 and recorded the complaint as stated by her. As per the orders of CPI he took the original complaint to Kolhar Police Station and handed over to PSI Kolhar to register a crime. He asserted in his examination-in-chief that CPI Bagewadi was present when he wrote the complaint. After a case was registered at Police Station Kolhar a copy of the FIR was given to him and he took it and gave it to the CPI in the village. He denied the suggestion that the information Ext.P-1 was not written in the village and that it was prepared at 2.00 p.m. in the police station. Shri Saidappa, CPI Bagewadi (PW-11) has a different story to tell. He deposed that after receiving wireless message he immediately rushed to Areshanker Village at about 9.30 a.m. He does not claim to have instructed PW-10 to reach the village of occurrence. When he went there PW-10 the Havaldar was not present. He came to learn that he had already obtained a complaint from PW-1 and had gone to Kolhar P.S. He waited till he got the FIR at about 1.30 p.m. from PW-10 who came from the police station and handed over a copy of the First Information Report. According to PW-1, PW-11 came to the village at about 12 noon and held inquest over the dead body of the accused. The defence is that PW-1 did not give any information to the police as she was not an eye witness, and only after her husband PW-3 returned from Muddebihal a false case was concocted. That explains why there is so much inconsistency between the statements of PW-10 the Havaldar and PW-11, the Investigating Officer. While PW-10 asserts that PW.1 was questioned by both of them and that on the instruction of PW-11 he left for Kolhar PS with the information to get a case registered, PW-11 on the other hand states that when he  Page 6 of 6 reached the place of occurrence PW-10 was not there at all and that he had already left with the report for getting the case registered at Kolhar P.S. This circumstance does raise a doubt as to whether the FIR was recorded early in the morning at about 8.00 or 8.30 a.m. or whether it was recorded later. PW-11 does not state that he had sent a wireless message to PW-10 to reach the village of occurrence. In fact he went to the village of occurrence with another Havaldar and a Police Constable, and there he learnt that PW-10 had already recorded the information given by PW-1, and had gone to the police station to get the case registered. How PW-10 came to know about the occurrence is shrouded in mystery? The inconsistencies in the evidence of PWs. 10 and 11 could not be explained and this gives rise to serious suspicion about the recording of the FIR at village Areshanker at 8.00 a.m. If PW-10 is to be believed that the information given by PW-1 was recorded in the presence of PW-11, then it must follow that it was not recorded at about 8.30 or 9.00 a.m. as claimed by the prosecution but later at about 10.00 a.m. or 12 noon when PW-11 as well as PW-3 came to the place of occurrence. This probablises the defence case that PW-1 was not an eye witness and therefore, only after her husband PW-3 and CPI (PW-11) came to the village, a false report was got scribed in the village or at the police station involving the appellants. We have undertaken a very close and critical scrutiny of the evidence of PW-1 and the other evidence on record only with a view to assess whether the evidence of PW-1 is of such quality that a conviction for the offence of murder can be safely rested on her sole testimony. This Court has repeatedly observed that on the basis of the testimony of a single eye witness a conviction may be recorded, but it has also cautioned that while doing so the Court must be satisfied that the testimony of the solitary eye witness is of such sterling quality that the Court finds it safe to base a conviction solely on the testimony of that witness. In doing so the Court must test the credibility of the witness by reference to the quality of his evidence. The evidence must be free of any blemish or suspicion, must impress the Court as wholly truthful, must appear to be natural and so convincing that the Court has no hesitation in recording a conviction solely on the basis of the testimony of a single witness. So tested, we do not find the evidence of PW-1 to be of that quality. In the first instance, she began with inventing a false story about existence of a motive. The narration of events as they took place before the actual murder of her son are also shown to be untrue. There is considerable doubt as to whether the first information was recorded on her saying at about 8.00 or 8.30 in the morning. Her evidence also leaves a lurking suspicion about her being an eye witness. Having discarded the evidence of PW-2, and the other two alleged eye witnesses having turned hostile, we find no reliable corroboration of her testimony. We do not find this case to be one in which the judgment of acquittal deserved to be set aside. We, therefore, feel compelled to give to the appellants the benefit of doubt while allowing their appeal. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed, the appellants are acquitted of the charge levelled against them, and they are directed to be released unless required in connection with any other case","B.P. Singh, J. The appellants have appealed to this Court by special leave against their conviction and sentence passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore on 26th May, 2004 in Criminal Appeal No. 1485 of 1998. The appellants were charged of the offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code for having committed the murder of Lakshman at about 6.00 a.m. on May 30, 1996 while he was sleeping on the ’katta’ of his house. The Principal Sessions Judge, Bijapur, who tried the appellants in Sessions Case No.144 of 1998 acquitted them of the charge by his judgment and order of September 14, 1998. The trial Court held that out of the four witnesses examined as eye witnesses, two, namely- PW.8 and PW.9 turned hostile and did not support the case of the prosecution. The remaining two witnesses were PW-1, Smt. Nimbavva, mother of the deceased and PW-2, Ayyappa, the younger brother of the deceased, aged about 12 years. On an appreciation of their evidence the trial court held that PW-2 had not really witnessed the occurrence while PW-1 was not a truthful witness. The High Court on re appreciation of the evidence on record came to the contrary conclusion that PWs. 1 and 2 were truthful eye-witnesses and on the basis of their evidence the appellants could be safely convicted of the offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC. Accordingly the appellants were sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life. The case of the prosecution is that on May 30, 1996 the deceased was sleeping on the ’katta’in the outer portion of the house by the side of the road, while the remaining members of the family were sleeping inside. According to PW-1 on May 30, 1996 her husband Basappa, PW-3 woke up at about 5.00 a.m. since he had to go to Muddebihal. PW-1 and PW-2 also woke up with him. PW-3 wanted the deceased to accompany him to Muddebihal but he insisted on sleeping and stated that he will come to Muddebihal with food by 9 O’ clock bus. While PW-3 left for Muddebihal, she started washing utensils at a place which was at a distance of about 2 meters from the ’katta’ where the deceased was sleeping. There is evidence on record to the effect that at about 5.00 a.m. it was dark but at about 6.00 a.m. there was some light as the sun was about to rise. At about that time she noticed the three accused variously armed coming there. While appellant No.2 was armed with an axe the other two were armed with ’Jambiya’. They came saying that they will finish the deceased. In spite of her begging of them not to do so, they started assaulting the deceased. She saw that appellant No.2 gave 2 or 3 blows on the neck of the deceased while the remaining two assaulted him with their weapons on different parts of the body. According to her, the occurrence was witnessed by her younger son, PW-2 and PWs. 8 and   of 6 9, the neighbours, who had come on hearing her cries. According to her a police havaldar came to her house after about 4-5 hours and recorded the information given by her. At about 12 noon an Inspector came who held inquest over the dead body of the deceased and took other steps in the course of investigation. The dead body of the deceased was then sent for post-mortem examination. In the First Information Report lodged by PW-1, it was stated that about 3 months before the date of occurrence, her son Lakshman, the deceased, who had illicit connection with Renuka (sister of appellant No.2) was seen following Renuka while she was going to wash clothes to the village ’nallah’. People of village had seen him following Renuka and with a view to protect her reputation Renuka complained to her mother and mother-in-law about the deceased dragging her. Thereafter the mother and mother-in-law of Renuka had come to her house and abused the deceased in filthy language. From that day onwards the appellants were moving about in the village saying that the deceased had insulted their sister and, therefore, they will not spare him and will finish him. In this background the occurrence took place on May 30, 1996. It is stated that her husband got up at 5.00 a.m. in the morning since he had to go to Muddebihal . She tried to wake up her son (deceased) but he insisted on sleeping since it was dark and said that he will get up after sun rise. She thereafter started sweeping and washing utensils. At about 6.00 a.m. the appellants came and finding her son sleeping on the ’katta’ said that they will not spare Lakshman (deceased). So saying, appellant No.2 assaulted the deceased on his neck twice or thrice with an axe while the remaining accused assaulted him with ’Jambiyas’ on his back and thigh. Her son died on the spot. They then ran away saying that they had finished Lakshman. She further stated in the FIR that her mother-in-law and her son PW-2 came out and witnessed the occurrence. PWs-8 and 9 of the neighborhood also witnessed the assault. It was alleged that out of anger and to take revenge for her son having illicit connection with Renuka, the appellants had committed the murder of her son. The evidence on record discloses that all the three appellants are the neighbours of PW.1. Since PWs. 8 and 9 did not support the case of the prosecution, they were declared hostile.

In all likelihood he was sleeping inside the house and when he came out of the house later, he only saw the dead body of the deceased. He cannot, therefore, be said to be an eye witness. PW-2 stated that on the date of the incident he was sleeping inside the house with his father, mother and grand-mother. There was  Page 3 of 6 a ’katta’ in the front portion of the house where the deceased was sleeping. In his examination-in-chief he asserted that he woke up early in the morning when his father and mother woke up. His father had to go to Muddebihal and while leaving for Muddebihal he (father) tried to awaken the deceased but the deceased insisted that he will come by 9 O’ clock bus and will bring meals.

In his cross-examination, however, he gave a different version altogether. He stated that when his father left for Muddebihal he did not wake up. He was not even aware as to when his father left, as he was asleep. He stated that on hearing the sound of bowling of his mother he woke up and saw the dead body of his brother. However, he denied the suggestion that he did not see the appellants assaulting his brother. It also appears from the evidence of PW-11, the Investigating Officer, that PW-2 had not stated before him that his father woke up his elder brother and asked him to accompany him but his brother did not go, and went to sleep, and that the accused came to their house. He also did not state about his mother pleading with the accused not to assault her son. In this state of the evidence, we entertain a serious doubt as to whether PW-2 is really an eye witness. In his examination-in-chief he claims to have woken up with his father when he was leaving for Muddebihal. In his cross-examination, his version is to the contrary. He has stated quite clearly that he did not even know when his father left since he was sleeping, and further that when he got up on hearing cries of his mother, the incident was over and on coming out he had seen the dead body of his brother. The evidence leads us to suspect the assertion of PW-2 that he is an eye witness. We are, therefore, inclined to accept the finding of the trial court that PW-2 had not witnessed the occurrence.

It is the case of the prosecution supported by PW-1 that her husband PW-3 slept inside the house while her deceased son slept outside on the ’katta’. This assertion of PW-1 is again contradicted by her husband PW-3 who stated that on that night he had not slept inside the house. In fact he had slept with his deceased son on the ’katta’. He further stated that he left his son sleeping and washed his face and, untied the cow tethered in front of his house and took the cow for sale to Muddebihal market. There was a pot of water on the ’katta’ where they had slept and he used that water for washing his face. He did not go inside the house. While leaving, he only awakened his wife. It obviously means that without going inside the house he may have awakened his wife by calling her and asking her to wake up. The deposition of PW-1 is to the effect that after her husband left for Muddebihal she started sweeping and cleaning the utensils. The evidence of PW-2, her son, Ayyappa, is that after his father left, his mother started rinsing utensils sitting inside the house and that he was standing in the front yard. The First Information Report is silent where she was washing utensils but in her deposition she clearly asserted that she was washing utensils just about 2 meters by the side of the ’katta’ on which her son, the deceased, was sleeping in the outer portion of the house by the side of the road. The evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 are, therefore, not consistent on this point. Apart from these inconsistencies there is one another aspect of the matter which creates a serious doubt about the truthfulness of the prosecution case. As noticed earlier, PW-10, Havaldar Appanna the Havaldar of Nidagundi Police Out Post was the first person to reach the place of occurrence. He deposed that at about 7.00 a.m. he had received a wireless message from the Circle Police Inspector of Basavan Bagewadi informing him that a murder had taken place in village Areshanker and that he should immediately proceed to the village. The CPI informed him that he would also be reaching there. According to PW-10 he reached the Village Areshanker at about 8.00 or 8.30 a.m. CPI Bagewadi had already reached the village. They questioned PW-1 and recorded the complaint as stated by her. As per the orders of CPI he took the original complaint to Kolhar Police Station and handed over to PSI Kolhar to register a crime. He asserted in his examination-in-chief that CPI Bagewadi was present when he wrote the complaint. After a case was registered at Police Station Kolhar a copy of the FIR was given to him and he took it and gave it to the CPI in the village. He denied the suggestion that the information Ext.P-1 was not written in the village and that it was prepared at 2.00 p.m. in the police station. Shri Saidappa, CPI Bagewadi (PW-11) has a different story to tell. He deposed that after receiving wireless message he immediately rushed to Areshanker Village at about 9.30 a.m. He does not claim to have instructed PW-10 to reach the village of occurrence. When he went there PW-10 the Havaldar was not present. He came to learn that he had already obtained a complaint from PW-1 and had gone to Kolhar P.S. He waited till he got the FIR at about 1.30 p.m. from PW-10 who came from the police station and handed over a copy of the First Information Report. According to PW-1, PW-11 came to the village at about 12 noon and held inquest over the dead body of the accused. The defence is that PW-1 did not give any information to the police as she was not an eye witness, and only after her husband PW-3 returned from Muddebihal a false case was concocted. That explains why there is so much inconsistency between the statements of PW-10 the Havaldar and PW-11, the Investigating Officer. While PW-10 asserts that PW.1 was questioned by both of them and that on the instruction of PW-11 he left for Kolhar PS with the information to get a case registered, PW-11 on the other hand states that when he  Page 6 of 6 reached the place of occurrence PW-10 was not there at all and that he had already left with the report for getting the case registered at Kolhar P.S. This circumstance does raise a doubt as to whether the FIR was recorded early in the morning at about 8.00 or 8.30 a.m. or whether it was recorded later. PW-11 does not state that he had sent a wireless message to PW-10 to reach the village of occurrence. In fact he went to the village of occurrence with another Havaldar and a Police Constable, and there he learnt that PW-10 had already recorded the information given by PW-1, and had gone to the police station to get the case registered. How PW-10 came to know about the occurrence is shrouded in mystery? The inconsistencies in the evidence of PWs. 10 and 11 could not be explained and this gives rise to serious suspicion about the recording of the FIR at village Areshanker at 8.00 a.m. If PW-10 is to be believed that the information given by PW-1 was recorded in the presence of PW-11, then it must follow that it was not recorded at about 8.30 or 9.00 a.m. as claimed by the prosecution but later at about 10.00 a.m. or 12 noon when PW-11 as well as PW-3 came to the place of occurrence. This probablises the defence case that PW-1 was not an eye witness and therefore, only after her husband PW-3 and CPI (PW-11) came to the village, a false report was got scribed in the village or at the police station involving the appellants. We have undertaken a very close and critical scrutiny of the evidence of PW-1 and the other evidence on record only with a view to assess whether the evidence of PW-1 is of such quality that a conviction for the offence of murder can be safely rested on her sole testimony. This Court has repeatedly observed that on the basis of the testimony of a single eye witness a conviction may be recorded, but it has also cautioned that while doing so the Court must be satisfied that the testimony of the solitary eye witness is of such sterling quality that the Court finds it safe to base a conviction solely on the testimony of that witness. In doing so the Court must test the credibility of the witness by reference to the quality of his evidence. The evidence must be free of any blemish or suspicion, must impress the Court as wholly truthful, must appear to be natural and so convincing that the Court has no hesitation in recording a conviction solely on the basis of the testimony of a single witness. So tested, we do not find the evidence of PW-1 to be of that quality. In the first instance, she began with inventing a false story about existence of a motive. The narration of events as they took place before the actual murder of her son are also shown to be untrue. There is considerable doubt as to whether the first information was recorded on her saying at about 8.00 or 8.30 in the morning. Her evidence also leaves a lurking suspicion about her being an eye witness. Having discarded the evidence of PW-2, and the other two alleged eye witnesses having turned hostile, we find no reliable corroboration of her testimony. We do not find this case to be one in which the judgment of acquittal deserved to be set aside. We, therefore, feel compelled to give to the appellants the benefit of doubt while allowing their appeal. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed, the appellants are acquitted of the charge levelled against them, and they are directed to be released unless required in connection with any other case"
16,Appeal (civil) 2896 of 2006,Pushpa Devi Bhagat (D) Th. LR.Smt. Sadhna Rai,Rajinder Singh & Ors.,11/07/2006,B P Singh & R V Raveendran,"J U D G M E N T (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 13894/2004) R. V. Raveendran, J. Leave granted. This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 3.3.2004 passed by learned Single Judge of Delhi High Court in FA No.247 of 2003. 2. Respondents 1 & 2 are the landlords of the suit property (front portion of residential premises no. C-25, Friends Colony, New Delhi). Respondents 1 & 2 and their father Late Brig. S. Rameshwar let out the suit property with the fittings and fixtures to M/s Usha Fisheries Agriculture and Dairy Farm, a partnership firm (third respondent herein) for a period of three years under a registered lease deed dated 6.6.1979, the purpose being the residential use of a partner of the firm. Pushpa Devi (mother of the appellant) and respondents 4, 5 & 6 were its partners. The suit property was being used by Pushpa Devi for her residential use. The tenancy was continued after the lease term of three years. 3. The landlords (Respondents 1 & 2 and their father) terminated the said tenancy as at the end of 31.3.1989 by notice dated 9.2.1989 and filed a suit against the firm and Pushpa Devi in the court of the District Judge, Delhi on 10.4.1989 for recovery of the possession of the suit property. It was originally numbered as RC Suit No. 265 of 1989 and later, transferred to the court of the Sub-Judge, New Delhi (later, Civil Judge, Delhi) and renumbered as Suit No. 52 of 1993. Pushpa Devi, second defendant, resisted the suit inter alia on the ground that the first defendant firm had been dissolved and as a consequence all its partners including herself became the co-tenants and the suit was not maintainable without impleading the other partners. Subsequently, M.L. Wadhwa, S. K. Mittal and Badan Singh (the other three partners of the firm), were impleaded as defendants 3 to 5. During the pendency of the suit, the first plaintiff S. Rameshwar died, and the suit was continued by showing his two sons (original plaintiffs 2 & 3) as plaintiffs 1 & 2. The fifth defendant also died and his son Chaman Lal Gahlot was brought on record in his place as the fifth defendant. 4. Two witnesses were examined on behalf of the plaintiffs and their evidence was closed on 16.9.1998. Thereafter, the case was adjourned a number of times for defendants’ evidence. Shri Dinesh Garg, counsel for defendants stated that as the first defendant firm was dissolved, he will not appear for the firm. In view of it, after issuing court notice, the first defendant was placed ex parte on 24.4.2000. The order-sheet dated 7.7.2000 shows that as defendants 2 & 3 did not let in any   of 14 evidence, their evidence was closed and the matter was listed for evidence of defendants 4 & 5. On 19.5.2001, the court made the following order :- ""The case was filed in the year 1989. Keeping in view the fact that it has already been delayed, defendant no. 4 and newly added defendant no.5 are given only one (more) opportunity to lead their evidence otherwise the same will be closed on the next date of hearing i.e. 23.5.1991."" On 23.5.1991, the two plaintiffs and their counsel and Shri Dinesh Garg, counsel for the Defendants were present. On the basis of the submissions made, the court recorded the following submissions in the order sheet : ""It is stated that the matter has been compromised between the parties. The defendants undertakes to vacate the suit premises by 22.1.2002 and will keep on paying the rent/damages of the suit premises @ Rs.4800/- with effect from 1.5.2001, till the time of vacation of the suit premises. Let the statement of both the parties be recorded."" (emphasis supplied) Thereafter, the following statement of Shri Dinesh Garg, counsel for defendants was recorded by the court : ""Statement of Shri Dinesh Garg, Adv. for the defendants. W. O. I have instructions on behalf of the defendants to make the present statement that the defendants undertake to vacate the suit premises by 22.1.2002 and will keep on paying the rent/damages @ Rs.4800/- w.e.f. 1.5.2001, till the vacation of the suit premises. The rent upto 30.4.2001 already stands paid. Sd/- Dinesh Garg, Adv. R.O.A.C. Thereafter, the following statement of Shri B. Khan, counsel for the plaintiffs was recorded : ""Statement of Shri B. Khan, Counsel for both the plaintiffs. W.O. I have instructions on behalf of plaintiffs to make the present statement that in view of the statement made by the counsel for the defendants, on behalf of the defendants, the suit may kindly be disposed of accordingly. I accept the terms of the statement of counsel for defendants. The plaintiffs are also present today in the court and will countersign this statement. (Sd. Civil Judge) Sd/- B. Khan, Adv. R.O.A.C. (Sd/- Civil Judge) In addition to the learned counsel for plaintiffs and defendants signing the order sheet, plaintiffs 1 & 2 who were present in court, also signed the order sheet. Thereafter, the court made the following order :- ""ORDER In view of the statement made by the counsel for parties in the presence of both the plaintiffs, the suit stands disposed off as settled. Parties to be bound by their statements made today. File be consigned to R/R. Decree sheet in terms of said compromise be prepared. 23.5.2001 Sd/Savita Rao Civil Judge, Delhi""  Page 3 of 14 5. It was subsequently found that Shri Dinesh Garg though appearing for all defendants, had not filed Vakalatnama for defendants 3 & 4 and one Shayam Kishore had entered appearance for them. Therefore, an application under sections 151 and 152 CPC was moved. Shri Dinesh Garg filed the Vakalatnama on behalf of the defendants 3 & 4 on 18.7.2001. In view of it, the trial court made the following order on 18.7.2001 : ""Reply to application under section 151 and 152 filed. Copies given. As stated Vakalatnama on behalf of the defendants 1, 2, & 5 is already on record but inadvertently, the Vakalatnama on behalf of the defendants 3 & 4 was not filed which the counsel Shri Dinesh Garg is filing today. It be taken on record. Counsel for defendant states that when he gave the statement, he was duly authorized on behalf of the defendants for making statement. He further states that defendant no. 1 is a partnership firm which has now been dissolved and is not in existence and even if the decree is passed against defendant no.1 then also it will be executable against defendents 2 to 5 only. However, I pass a decree against all the defendants. Let the decree be modified and a fresh decree sheet be prepared mentioning therein that the defendants will vacate the suit premises by 22.1.2002 and will keep on paying the rent/damages @ Rs.4800/- with effect from 1.5.2001 till the vacation of the suit premises, i.e., front portion forming part of premises No.C-25, Friends Colony, New Delhi as shown red in the site plan annexed with the plaint. File be sent to RR. Sd/Civil Judge"" Accordingly, a fresh decree was drawn on 18.7.2001 in terms of the final order dated 23.5.2001. 6. On 21.8.2001, second defendant (Pushpa Devi) filed an application under section 151 CPC for setting aside the decree dated 18.7.2001 alleging that she had not instructed her counsel Shri Dinesh Garg to enter into any compromise on her behalf that there was no ""written compromise between the parties duly signed by the parties"", and therefore, there was no lawful agreement or compromise. The court issued notice of the said application to Shri Dinesh Garg, counsel for the defendants as also the plaintiffs. Shri Dinesh Garg filed a detailed statement dated 7.12.2001. We extract below the relevant portions of the said statement : ""The counsel had represented the defendant no. 2 for about 12 years in the aforesaid matter. The counsel was getting the instructions from the defendant no. 2 most of times through her daughter Ms. Sadhna Rai or her son in law, Shri Vinay Rai or through Group Head of Law Department Dr. M.C. Gupta. All the proceedings were always communicated to the defendant no.2. After the closing of evidence by the plaintiff, the case was listed for the defendant’s evidence time and again and under instructions of the defendant no. 2, the counsel took adjournments for evidence for several years. The adjournment were taken on 4.12.1998, 5.4.1999 and 21.5.1999. When the case fixed for 12.7.1999 for evidence of defendant no. 2, she again did not come and sent her medical  Page 4 of 14 certificate which was placed on record and case was adjourned to 8.9.1999. Again adjournment was sought and the case was adjourned to 22.10.1999 as last and final opportunity for her evidence. A written communication dated 20.9.1999 was sent by registered post to defendant no. 2, but she did not appear. Again adjournment was sought as per her instructions and this time the case was adjourned for 30.11.1999 for her evidence subject to cost of Rs.500/- which was paid by her but still she did not appear in witness box. Even thereafter case was adjourned on 13.1.2000, 24.4.2000, 7.7.2000, 4.9.2000, 16.10.2000, 20.12.2000 and 26.4.2001 for evidence of remaining defendants but none appeared in witness box. After contesting the matter for about 10 years when it was not possible to take any further date for recording of the evidence of the defendants, the counsel advised the defendant no. 2 to lead evidence and made it clear that it will not be possible the counsel to meet any further adjournment. However, she requested for getting her some time to enable her to find an alternative accommodation. The counsel took her oral instructions under good faith and because of level of confidence developed after representing Usha Group for about 18 years, started negotiations with the plaintiff which went on for several months, during which period there were several offers and counter offers duly communicated to the defendants. Ultimately when plaintiff came out with plea to first clear the arrears of rent with effect from 01.10.1999, the counsel asked defendant no. 2 to clear the arrears which were sent to counsel vide communication of their Law Officer dated 9.4.2001 through the Head of Law Department Dr. M.C. Gupta. After that, the term are negotiated and ultimately, with prior approval of defendant no. 2 a statement was made on behalf of the defendant no. 2 as well on behalf of the other defendants and the decree was obtained based on admission. Pursuant to request of the counsel, the plaintiff as well as this Hon’ble Court was pleased to allow time upto 22.1.2002 to the defendants to vacate the premises. Immediately after recording of the statement, a written communication dated 24.5.2001 was sent to the defendant no. 2 as well as to Dr. M.C. Gupta, Head of the Law Department of Usha Group of Companies was sent by Registered A.D. post clearly indicating therein that a statement has been made as per the instructions and that the decree has been passed. This communication was duly received by the defendant no. 2 as well as Dr. M.C. Gupta. The copy of the letter, postal receipts and the AD card duly signed by the defendant as received are annexed."" 7. The second defendant did not, however, pursue her application dated 21.8.2001 for setting aside the consent decree. On 27.8.2001, within six days of filing the application dated 21.8.2001 before the trial court for setting aside the decree, the  Page 5 of 14 second defendant filed an appeal against the said consent decree before the District Judge, Delhi. The appellate court by judgment dated 21.12.2002 set aside the consent decree on the ground that there was no agreement or compromise reduced to writing and signed by the parties. The matter was remanded to the trial court with a direction to proceed with the trial of the suit in accordance with the law by ignoring the statement of the counsel made on 23.5.2001. 8. The said judgment of the Appellate Court was challenged by the landlords in FAO No. 247 of 2003 on the file of the Delhi High Court, under Order 43 Rule (1)(u) of CPC. During the pendency of the said appeal before the High Court, Pushpa Devi died, and her daughter (the Appellant) came on record and pursued the appeal. The High Court allowed the landlords’ appeal by judgment dated 3.3.2004. The High Court held that the consent decree in question did not fall under the first part of Rule 3 of Order 23 (requiring an agreement or compromise between the parties to be in writing and signed by the parties), but fell under the second part of Rule 3 of Order 23 (relating to satisfaction of the claim of the plaintiff, which did not require any document in writing signed by the parties), and that there was a valid compromise under Order 23 Rule 3 CPC and the second defendant ""could not repudiate the consensus by attempting to challenge their satisfaction"". From the fact that the second defendant did not pursue the application dated 21.8.2001 filed before the trial court, and from the fact that she did not challenge the integrity of her counsel (who entered into the compromise) either before the appellate court or before it, the High Court drew an inference that second defendant’s counsel Sri Dinesh Garg, had the authority on her behalf to make the statement leading to the consent decree. 9. The judgment of the High Court is challenged by the appellant (second defendant’s legal representative) in this appeal. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the High Court having held that the case did not fall under the first part of Rule 3 of Order 23, committed a serious error in holding that the case fell under the second part of the said Rule. It is contended that the second part applies only where the defendant satisfies the plaintiff in regard to the whole or part of the subject matter of the suit. It is pointed out that the second part refers to completed acts, that is acts which have been already executed or performed, where nothing more remains to be done in future by a defendant. He submitted that in this case when the counsel for the defendants agreed to vacate the suit premises on a future date, that is on or before 22.1.2002, it was a promise or an agreement to do an act in future to satisfy the suit claim, and not a case where ""defendant satisfies the plaintiff in respect of the subject matter of the suit"". He pointed out that if the defendants had vacated and delivered the premises to the plaintiffs and thereafter the counsel for the defendants had confirmed the same and the suit had been disposed of recording the said submission, then it would fall under the second part. The appellant contends that the High Court having held that the case did not fall under the first part of Rule 3, and the case demonstrably not falling under the second part of Rule 3, it has to be held that there was no lawful agreement or compromise. It is submitted that the first appellate court was justified in setting aside the consent decree and remanding the matter to the trial court. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the landlords contended that the District Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal against a consent decree. It is also contended that there was a compromise by admitting the claim of the plaintiffs, and, therefore, the consequential decree is valid and binding. On  Page 6 of 14 the contentions raised, the following two questions arise for consideration : (i) Whether the appeal filed by Pushpa Devi under section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, against the consent decree was maintainable. (ii) Whether the compromise on 23.5.2001 resulting in a consent decree dated 18.7.2001 was not a valid compromise under Order 23 Rule 3 CPC. Re : Point No. (i) 10. It is no doubt true that the landlords did not contend either before the first appellate court or before the High Court that the appeal against the consent decree was not maintainable. This contention is urged for the first time in this Court. The contention relates to jurisdiction of the appellate court and is evident from the record. Such a plea does not require any evidence. Further, being a contention relating to the jurisdiction of the appellate court, it does not require any ’pleading’. Though this Court will not normally permit a new plea to be raised at the hearing of the special leave petition or an appeal under Article 136, where such plea does not involve any question of fact or amendment of pleading and is purely one of law, particularly relating to jurisdiction of the appellate court, it can be entertained by this Court. (See Shanti Devi vs. Bimla Devi - AIR 1988 SC 2141 and Zahoor vs. State of U.P - AIR 1991 SC 41). In Hiralal vs. Kasturi Devi [AIR 1967 SC 1853], this Court observed : ""\005\005\005\005\005. though the question of jurisdiction had not been urged before the High Court, it stares one in the face of the judgment of the appellate court. We are satisfied that the appellate court had no jurisdiction \005\005\005\005\005 though this point was not raised in the High Court, it is so obvious that we have permitted the plea to be raised before us."" In this case, the contention raised being one relating to jurisdiction of the appellate court, we have permitted the said contention and heard both sides thereon. 11. Section 96 provides for appeals from original decrees. Sub-section (3) of section 96, however, provided that no appeal shall lie from a decree passed by the court with the consent of the parties. We may notice here that Order 43 Rule 1 (m) of CPC had earlier provided for an appeal against the order under Rule 3 Order 23 recording or refusing to record an agreement, compromise or satisfaction. But clause (m) of Rule 1 Order 43 was omitted by Act 104 of 1976 with effect from 1.2.1977. Simultaneously, a proviso was added to Rule 3 Order 23 with effect from 1.2.1977. We extract below the relevant portion of the said proviso : ""Provided that where it is alleged by one party and denied by the other that an adjustment or satisfaction has been arrived at, the court shall decide the question\005"" Rule 3A was also added in Order 23 with effect from 1.2.1977 barring any suit to set aside a decree on the ground that the compromise on which the decree is based was not lawful. 12. The position that emerges from the amended provisions of  Page 7 of 14 Order 23, can be summed up thus : (i) No appeal is maintainable against a consent decree having regard to the specific bar contained in section 96(3) CPC. (ii) No appeal is maintainable against the order of the court recording the compromise (or refusing to record a compromise) in view of the deletion of clause (m) Rule 1 Order 43. (iii) No independent suit can be filed for setting aside a compromise decree on the ground that the compromise was not lawful in view of the bar contained in Rule 3A. (iv) A consent decree operates as an estoppel and is valid and binding unless it is set aside by the court which passed the consent decree, by an order on an application under the proviso to Rule 3 of Order 23. Therefore, the only remedy available to a party to a consent decree to avoid such consent decree, is to approach the court which recorded the compromise and made a decree in terms of it, and establish that there was no compromise. In that event, the court which recorded the compromise will itself consider and decide the question as to whether there was a valid compromise or not. This is so because a consent decree, is nothing but contract between parties superimposed with the seal of approval of the court. The validity of a consent decree depends wholly on the validity of the agreement or compromise on which it is made. The second defendant, who challenged the consent compromise decree was fully aware of this position as she filed an application for setting aside the consent decree on 21.8.2001 by alleging that there was no valid compromise in accordance with law. Significantly, none of the other defendants challenged the consent decree. For reasons best known to herself, the second defendant within a few days thereafter (that is on 27.8.2001), filed an appeal and chose not to pursue the application filed before the court which passed the consent decree. Such an appeal by second defendant was not maintainable, having regard to the express bar contained in section 96 (3) of the Code. Re : Point No. (ii) 13. Order XXIII deals with withdrawal and adjustment of suits. Rule 3 relates to compromise of suits, relevant portion of which is extracted below : ""3. Compromise of suit.\027Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that a suit has been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise in writing and signed by the parties, or where the defendant satisfies the plaintiff in respect of the whole or any part of the subject matter of the suit, the Court shall order such agreement, compromise or satisfaction to be recorded, and shall pass a decree in accordance therewith so far as it relates to the parties to the suit, whether or not the subject-matter of the agreement, compromise or satisfaction is the same as the subject-matter of the suit."" The said Rule consists of two parts. The first part provides that  Page 8 of 14 where it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that a suit has been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise in writing and signed by the parties, the court shall order such agreement or compromise to be recorded and shall pass a decree in accordance therewith. The second part provides that where a defendant satisfies the plaintiff in respect of the whole or any part of the subject matter of the suit, the court shall order such satisfaction to be recorded and shall pass a decree in accordance therewith. The Rule also makes it clear that the compromise or agreement may relate to issues or disputes which are not the subject-matter of the suit and that such compromise or agreement may be entered not only among the parties to the suit, but others also, but the decree to be passed shall be confined to the parties to the suit whether or not the subject matter of the agreement, compromise or satisfaction is the same as the subject matter of the suit. We are not, however, concerned with this aspect of the Rule in this appeal. 14. What is the difference between the first part and the second part of Rule 3 ? The first part refers to situations where an agreement or compromise is entered into in writing and signed by the parties. The said agreement or compromise is placed before the court. When the court is satisfied that the suit has been adjusted either wholly or in part by such agreement or compromise in writing and signed by the parties and that it is lawful, a decree follows in terms of what is agreed between the parties. The agreement/compromise spells out the agreed terms by which the claim is admitted or adjusted by mutual concessions or promises, so that the parties thereto can be held to their promise/s in future and performance can be enforced by the execution of the decree to be passed in terms of it. On the other hand, the second part refers to cases where the defendant has satisfied the plaintiff about the claim. This may be by satisfying the plaintiff that his claim cannot be or need not be met or performed. It can also be by discharging or performing the required obligation. Where the defendant so ’satisfies’ the plaintiff in respect of the subject-matter of the suit, nothing further remains to be done or enforced and there is no question of any ’enforcement’ or ’execution’ of the decree to be passed in terms of it. Let us illustrate with reference to a money-suit filed for recovery of say a sum of Rupees one lakh. Parties may enter into a lawful agreement or compromise in writing and signed by them, agreeing that the defendant will pay the sum of Rupees one lakh within a specified period or specified manner or may agree that only a sum of Rs.75,000 shall be paid by the defendant in full and final settlement of the claim. Such agreement or compromise will fall under the first Part and if defendant does not fulfil the promise, the plaintiff can enforce it by levying execution. On the other hand, the parties may submit to the court that defendant has already paid a sum of Rupees one lakh or Rs.75,000/- in full and final satisfaction or that the suit claim has been fully settled by the defendant out of court (either by mentioning the amount paid or not mentioning it) or that plaintiff will not press the claim. Here the obligation is already performed by the defendant or plaintiff agrees that he will not enforce performance and nothing remains to be performed by the defendant. As the order that follows merely records the extinguishment or satisfaction of the claim or non existence of the claim, it is not capable of being ’enforced’ by levy of execution, as there is no obligation to be performed by the defendant in pursuance of the decree. Such ’satisfaction’ need not be expressed by an agreement or compromise in writing and signed by the parties. It can be by a unilateral submission by the plaintiff or his counsel. Such satisfaction will  Page 9 of 14 fall under the second part. Of course even when there is such satisfaction of the claim or subject matter of the suit by defendant and the matter falls under the second part, nothing prevents the parties from reducing such satisfaction of the claim/subject matter, into writing and signing the same. The difference between the two parts is this : Where the matter falls under the second part, what is reported is a completed action or settlement out of court putting an end to the dispute, and the resultant decree recording the satisfaction, is not capable of being enforced by levying execution. Where the matter falls under the first part, there is a promise or promises agreed to be performed or executed, and that can be enforced by levying execution. While agreements or compromises falling under the first part, can only be by an instrument or other form of writing signed by the parties, there is no such requirement in regard to settlements or satisfaction falling under the second part. Where the matter falls under second part, it is sufficient if the plaintiff or plaintiff’s counsel appears before the court and informs the court that the subject matter of the suit has already been settled or satisfied. 15. In a suit against the tenant for possession, if the settlement is that the tenant will vacate the premises within a specified time, it means that the possession could be recovered in execution of such decree in the event of the defendant failing to vacate the premises within the time agreed. Therefore, such settlement would fall under the first part. On the other hand, if both parties or the plaintiff submit to the court that the tenant has already vacated the premises and thus the claim for possession has been satisfied or if the plaintiff submits that he will not press the prayer for delivery of possession, the suit will be disposed of recording the same, under the second part. In such an event, there will be disposal of the suit, but no ’executable’ decree. 16. In this case, under the settlement, the tenant undertook to vacate the suit property on a future date (that is 22.1.2002) and pay the agreed rent till then. The decree in pursuance of such settlement was an ’executable’ decree. Therefore the settlement did not fall under the second part, but under the first part of Rule 3. The High Court obviously committed an error in holding that the case fell under the second part of Rule 3. 17. The next question is where an agreement or compromise falls under the first part, what is the meaning and significance of the words ’in writing’ and ’signed by the parties’ occurring in Rule 3 ? The appellant contends that the words ’in writing’ and ’signed by the parties’ would contemplate drawing up of a document or instrument or a compromise petition containing the terms of the settlement in writing and signed by the parties. The appellant points out that in this case, there is no such instrument, document or petition in writing and signed by the parties. 18. We will first consider the meaning of the words ""signed by parties"". Order 3 Rule 1 of CPC provides that any appearance, application or act in or to any Court, required or authorized by law to be made or done by a party in such Court, may, except where otherwise expressly provided by any law for the time being in force, be made or done by the party in person, or by his recognized agent, or by a pleader appearing, applying or acting, as the case may be, on his behalf. The proviso thereto makes it clear that the Court can, if it so desires, direct that such appearance shall be made by the party in person. Rule 4 provides that no pleader shall act for any person in any Court,   14 unless he has been appointed for the purpose by such person by a document in writing signed by such person or by his recognized agent or by some other person duly authorized by or under a power-of-attorney to make such appointment. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 4 provides that every such appointment shall be filed in Court and shall, for the purposes of sub-rule (1), be deemed to be in force until determined with the leave of the Court by a writing signed by the client or the pleader, as the case may be, and filed in Court, or until the client or the pleader dies, or until all proceedings in the suit are ended so far as regards the client. The question whether ’signed by parties’ would include signing by the pleader was considered by this Court in Byram Pestonji Gariwala v. Union Bank of India [1992 (1) SCC 31] with reference to Order 3 of CPC : ""30. There is no reason to assume that the legislature intended to curtail the implied authority of counsel, engaged in the thick of proceedings in court, to compromise or agree on matters relating to the parties, even if such matters exceed the subject matter of the suit. The relationship of counsel and his party or the recognized agent and his principal is a matter of contract; and with the freedom of contract generally, the legislature does not interfere except when warranted by public policy, and the legislative intent is expressly made manifest. There is no such declaration of policy or indication of intent in the present case. The legislature has not evinced any intention to change the well recognized and universally acclaimed common law tradition \005 x x x x x 35. So long as the system of judicial administration in India continues unaltered, and so long as Parliament has not evinced an intention to change its basic character, there is no reason to assume that Parliament has, though not expressly, but impliedly reduced counsel’s role or capacity to represent his client as effectively as in the past\005 x x x x x 37. We may, however, hasten to add that it will be prudent for counsel not to act on implied authority except when warranted by the exigency of circumstances demanding immediate adjustment of suit by agreement of compromise and the signature of the party cannot be obtained without undue delay. In these days of easier and quicker communication, such contingency may seldom arise. A wise and careful counsel will no doubt arm himself in advance with the necessary authority expressed in writing to meet all such contingencies in order that neither his authority nor integrity is ever doubted\005 38. Considering the traditionally recognized role of counsel in the common law system, and the evil sought to be remedied by Parliament by the C.P.C. (Amendment) Act, 1976, namely, attainment of certainty and expeditious disposal of cases by reducing the terms of compromise to writing signed by the parties, and allowing   of 14 the compromise decree to comprehend even matters falling outside the subject matter of the suit, but relating to the parties, the legislature cannot, in the absence of express words to such effect, be presumed to have disallowed the parties to enter into a compromise by counsel in their cause or by their duly authorized agents. 39. To insist upon the party himself personally signing the agreement or compromise would often cause undue delay, loss and inconvenience, especially in the case of non-resident persons. It has always been universally understood that a party can always act by his duly authorized representative. If a power-of-attorney holder can enter into an agreement or compromise on behalf of his principal, so can counsel, possessed of the requisite authorization by vakalatnama, act on behalf of his client\005.. If the legislature had intended to make such a fundamental change, even at the risk of delay, inconvenience and needless expenditure, it would have expressly so stated."" [Emphasis supplied] The above view was reiterated in Jineshwardas v. Jagrani [2003 (11) SCC 372]. Therefore, the words ’by parties’ refer not only to parties in person, but their attorney holders or duly authorized pleaders. 19. Let us now turn to the requirement of ’in writing’ in Rule 3. In this case as noticed above, the respective statements of plaintiffs’ counsel and defendants’ counsel were recorded on oath by the trial court in regard to the terms of the compromise and those statements after being read over and accepted to be correct, were signed by the said counsel. If the terms of a compromise written on a paper in the form of an application or petition is considered as a compromise in writing, can it be said that the specific and categorical statements on oath recorded in writing by the court and duly read over and accepted to be correct by the person making the statement and signed by him, can be said to be not in writing? Obviously, no. We may also in this behalf refer to Section 3 of the Evidence Act which defines a document as any matter expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures or marks or by more than one of those means intended to be used or which may be used for the purpose of recording the matter. The statements recorded by the court will, therefore, amount to a compromise in writing. 20. Consequently, the statements of the parties or their counsel, recorded by the court and duly signed by the persons making the statements, would be ’statement in writing signed by the parties’. The court, however, has to satisfy itself that the terms of the compromise are lawful. In this case we find from the trial court records that the second defendant had executed a vakalatnama empowering her counsel Sri Dinesh Garg to act for her in respect of the suit and also to enter into any compromise. Hence there can be no doubt that Sri Dinesh Garg was authorized by the second defendant to enter into a compromise. We also find that the counsel for the plaintiffs and counsel for the defendants made solemn statements on oath before the trial court specifying the terms of compromise, which were duly recorded in writing and signed by them. The requirements of the   of 14 first part of Rule 3 of Order XXIII are fully satisfied in this case. 21. The matter can be viewed from a different angle also. After the issues were framed by the trial court, the plaintiffs had examined two witnesses and closed their evidence and thereafter the matter was set down for the evidence of defendants. The first defendant was treated as ex parte. As defendants 2 and 3 did not lead any evidence in spite of numerous opportunities, their evidence was treated as closed. On 17.5.2001, the matter was finally adjourned to 23.5.2001 for the evidence of defendants 4 and 5 with a condition that if they do not lead evidence on that date there evidence will be closed. On 23.5.2001, defendants 4 and 5 did not lead any evidence. On the other hand, the counsel for defendants made a statement on oath that the premises will be vacated on 22.1.2002. Thereafter, counsel for the plaintiff also made a statement agreeing to grant of time till 21.1.2002. There was also agreement that the plaintiffs will be entitled to the payment of only Rs.4,800/- per month (equivalent to the rent) and nothing more up to 22.1.2002. The effect of it is that the parties have gone to trial on the issues and the only evidence led by defendants is that they will vacate the premises on 22.1.2002. No other evidence being led, the necessary conclusion is that the defendants admitted the plaintiffs’ claim and merely sought time to vacate. Therefore, the suit can be said to have been decreed on the basis of evidence and the admissions made by the defendants. In Jineshwardas (supra), such a situation was noticed. In that case, the High Court made an order on a consensus expressed by both the learned counsel at the time of hearing of the second appeal, that the respondents will pay Rs.25,000/- within a period of one month with interest in the manner stipulated. The appellant subsequently filed an application for review, contending that the said order disposing of the appeal was a compromise decree, and as it was not in writing and signed by the parties, the appeal could not have been disposed of on the basis of the submissions. The High Court, however, refused to entertain such objections. This Court while upholding the decision of the High Court and holding that there was a valid compromise, also observed : ""That apart, we are also of the view that a judgment or decree passed as a result of consensus arrived at before court, cannot always be said to be one passed on compromise or settlement and adjustment. It may, at times, be also a judgment on admission, as in this case."" 22. Strong reliance was placed by the appellant on the following observations of this Court in Gurpreet Singh v. Chatur Bhuj Goel [1988 (1) SCC 270] to contend that a compromise should be reduced into writing in the form of an ’instrument’ and signed by the parties to be valid under Order 23 Rule 3. He submitted that recording of the statements of the parties or their counsel, would not be an instrument of compromise. An ’instrument’, according to him, connotes a regular document drawn up in the form of an agreement. We extract below the observations relied on by the appellant : ""10. Under Rule 3 as it now stands, when a claim in suit has been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise, the compromise must be in writing and signed by the parties and there must be a completed agreement between them. To constitute an  Page 13 of 14 adjustment, an agreement or compromise must itself be capable of being embodied in a decree. When the parties enter into a compromise during the hearing of a suit or appeal, there is no reason why the requirement that the compromise should be reduced in writing in the form of an instrument signed by the parties should be dispensed with. The court must therefore insist upon the parties to reduce the terms into writing."" We have already referred to the definition of the term document. The term instrument used in Gurpreet Singh (supra) refers to a writing of a formal nature and nothing more. Further, we will have to understand the observations in the context in which they were made. In that case when the hearing of a Letters Patent Appeal commenced before the High Court, the parties took time to explore the possibility of a settlement. When the hearing was resumed the appellant’s father made an offer for settlement which was endorsed by counsel for the appellant also. The respondent who was present also made a statement accepting the offer. Evidently, the said offer and acceptance were not treated as final as the appeal was not disposed of by recording those terms. On the other hand, the said ’proposals’ were recorded and the matter adjourned for payment in terms of the offer. When the matter was taken up on the next date of hearing, the respondent stated that he was not agreeable. The High Court directed that the appeal will have to be heard on merits as the respondent was not prepared to abide by the proposed compromise. That order was challenged by the appellant by contending that the matter was settled by a lawful compromise by recording the statements of the appellant’s counsel and respondent’s counsel, and the respondent could not resile from such compromise and therefore, the High Court ought to have disposed of the appeal in terms of the compromise. It is in this factual background, that is, where there was no consent decree, the question was considered by this Court. The distinguishing feature in that case is that though the submissions made were recorded, they were not signed by the parties or their counsel. Nor did the court treat the submissions as a compromise. In this case, the court not only recorded the terms of settlement but thereafter directed that the statements of the counsel be recorded. Thereafter, the statements of counsel were recorded on oath, read over and accepted by the counsel to be correct and then signed by both counsel. Therefore in this case, there is a valid compromise in writing and signed by the parties (represented counsel). The decision in Gurpreet Singh (supra) is therefore of no assistance to the appellant. 23. At the cost of repetition, we may recapitulate the facts of this case. The suit was a simple suit for possession by a landlord against a tenant filed in the year 1993. Plaintiff’s evidence was closed in 1998. The contesting defendant (defendant No.2) did not lead any evidence, and her evidence was treated as closed. The matter was dragged on for 3 years for defendant’s evidence after the conclusion of plaintiff’s evidence. It was noted on 19.5.2001 that no further adjournment will be granted for the evidence of defendants 4 and 5 (who are not contesting the matter), on the next date of hearing (23.5.2001). When the matter finally came up on 23.5.2001, no evidence was tendered. On the other hand, a statement was made agreeing to vacate the premises by 22.1.2002. The trial court took care to ensure that the statements of both counsel were recorded on oath and signed. Thereafter, it passed a consent decree. The attempts of  Page 14 of 14 tenants in such matters to protract the litigation indefinitely by raising frivolous and vexatious contentions regarding the compromise and going back on the solemn undertaking given to court, should be deprecated. In this context, we may refer to the observation made by this Court a similar situation in Smt. Jamilabai Abdul Kadar v. Shankarlal Gulabchand [AIR 1975 SC 2202] : ""23. On the facts of the present case we have little doubt the pleader has acted substantially with the knowledge of and encouraged by his client. x x x x x 24. We feel no doubt that the broad sanction for the compromise came from the tenant., that no shady action is imputable to respondent 4 and that his conduct has been motivated by the good of his client. 25. The last posting was for reporting the compromise. But, on that date, the Court declined further adjournment and the party being absent and away, the pleader for the appellant had no alternative but to suffer an eviction decree or settle it to the maximum advantage of his party. \005"" Similar are the facts here. Neither the second defendant nor her legal representative has attributed any improper motive to second defendant’s counsel. The facts go to show nothing further could have been done for the defendants-tenants. All that the counsel for defendants had done was to get the maximum advantage to his clients in the circumstances after dragging on the matter to the extent possible. 24. This appeal is, therefore, liable to be dismissed as being devoid of merit. The consent decree is upheld, though for reasons different from those which weighed with the High Court. The landlords (respondents) will be entitled to seek mesne profits for the period from 22.1.2002 to date of delivery of possession in accordance with law. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs. The costs payable by the appellant are quantified at Rs.25,000/-.","J U D G M E N T (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 13894/2004) R. V. Raveendran, J. Leave granted. This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 3.3.2004 passed by learned Single Judge of Delhi High Court in FA No.247 of 2003. 2. Respondents 1 & 2 are the landlords of the suit property (front portion of residential premises no. C-25, Friends Colony, New Delhi). Respondents 1 & 2 and their father Late Brig. S. Rameshwar let out the suit property with the fittings and fixtures to M/s Usha Fisheries Agriculture and Dairy Farm, a partnership firm (third respondent herein) for a period of three years under a registered lease deed dated 6.6.1979, the purpose being the residential use of a partner of the firm. Pushpa Devi (mother of the appellant) and respondents 4, 5 & 6 were its partners. The suit property was being used by Pushpa Devi for her residential use. The tenancy was continued after the lease term of three years. 3. The landlords (Respondents 1 & 2 and their father) terminated the said tenancy as at the end of 31.3.1989 by notice dated 9.2.1989 and filed a suit against the firm and Pushpa Devi in the court of the District Judge, Delhi on 10.4.1989 for recovery of the possession of the suit property. It was originally numbered as RC Suit No. 265 of 1989 and later, transferred to the court of the Sub-Judge, New Delhi (later, Civil Judge, Delhi) and renumbered as Suit No. 52 of 1993. Pushpa Devi, second defendant, resisted the suit inter alia on the ground that the first defendant firm had been dissolved and as a consequence all its partners including herself became the co-tenants and the suit was not maintainable without impleading the other partners. Subsequently, M.L. Wadhwa, S. K. Mittal and Badan Singh (the other three partners of the firm), were impleaded as defendants 3 to 5. During the pendency of the suit, the first plaintiff S. Rameshwar died, and the suit was continued by showing his two sons (original plaintiffs 2 & 3) as plaintiffs 1 & 2. The fifth defendant also died and his son Chaman Lal Gahlot was brought on record in his place as the fifth defendant. 4. Two witnesses were examined on behalf of the plaintiffs and their evidence was closed on 16.9.1998. Thereafter, the case was adjourned a number of times for defendants’ evidence. Shri Dinesh Garg, counsel for defendants stated that as the first defendant firm was dissolved, he will not appear for the firm. In view of it, after issuing court notice, the first defendant was placed ex parte on 24.4.2000. The order-sheet dated 7.7.2000 shows that as defendants 2 & 3 did not let in any   of 14 evidence, their evidence was closed and the matter was listed for evidence of defendants 4 & 5. On 19.5.2001, the court made the following order :- ""The case was filed in the year 1989. Keeping in view the fact that it has already been delayed, defendant no. 4 and newly added defendant no.5 are given only one (more) opportunity to lead their evidence otherwise the same will be closed on the next date of hearing i.e. 23.5.1991."" On 23.5.1991, the two plaintiffs and their counsel and Shri Dinesh Garg, counsel for the Defendants were present. On the basis of the submissions made, the court recorded the following submissions in the order sheet : ""It is stated that the matter has been compromised between the parties. The defendants undertakes to vacate the suit premises by 22.1.2002 and will keep on paying the rent/damages of the suit premises @ Rs.4800/- with effect from 1.5.2001, till the time of vacation of the suit premises. Let the statement of both the parties be recorded."" (emphasis supplied) Thereafter, the following statement of Shri Dinesh Garg, counsel for defendants was recorded by the court : ""Statement of Shri Dinesh Garg, Adv. for the defendants. W. O. I have instructions on behalf of the defendants to make the present statement that the defendants undertake to vacate the suit premises by 22.1.2002 and will keep on paying the rent/damages @ Rs.4800/- w.e.f. 1.5.2001, till the vacation of the suit premises. The rent upto 30.4.2001 already stands paid. Sd/- Dinesh Garg, Adv. R.O.A.C. Thereafter, the following statement of Shri B. Khan, counsel for the plaintiffs was recorded : ""Statement of Shri B. Khan, Counsel for both the plaintiffs. W.O. I have instructions on behalf of plaintiffs to make the present statement that in view of the statement made by the counsel for the defendants, on behalf of the defendants, the suit may kindly be disposed of accordingly. I accept the terms of the statement of counsel for defendants. The plaintiffs are also present today in the court and will countersign this statement. (Sd. Civil Judge) Sd/- B. Khan, Adv. R.O.A.C. (Sd/- Civil Judge) In addition to the learned counsel for plaintiffs and defendants signing the order sheet, plaintiffs 1 & 2 who were present in court, also signed the order sheet. Thereafter, the court made the following order :- ""ORDER In view of the statement made by the counsel for parties in the presence of both the plaintiffs, the suit stands disposed off as settled. Parties to be bound by their statements made today. File be consigned to R/R. Decree sheet in terms of said compromise be prepared. 23.5.2001 Sd/Savita Rao Civil Judge, Delhi""  Page 3 of 14 5. It was subsequently found that Shri Dinesh Garg though appearing for all defendants, had not filed Vakalatnama for defendants 3 & 4 and one Shayam Kishore had entered appearance for them. Therefore, an application under sections 151 and 152 CPC was moved. Shri Dinesh Garg filed the Vakalatnama on behalf of the defendants 3 & 4 on 18.7.2001. In view of it, the trial court made the following order on 18.7.2001 : ""Reply to application under section 151 and 152 filed. Copies given. As stated Vakalatnama on behalf of the defendants 1, 2, & 5 is already on record but inadvertently, the Vakalatnama on behalf of the defendants 3 & 4 was not filed which the counsel Shri Dinesh Garg is filing today. It be taken on record. Counsel for defendant states that when he gave the statement, he was duly authorized on behalf of the defendants for making statement. He further states that defendant no. 1 is a partnership firm which has now been dissolved and is not in existence and even if the decree is passed against defendant no.1 then also it will be executable against defendents 2 to 5 only. However, I pass a decree against all the defendants. Let the decree be modified and a fresh decree sheet be prepared mentioning therein that the defendants will vacate the suit premises by 22.1.2002 and will keep on paying the rent/damages @ Rs.4800/- with effect from 1.5.2001 till the vacation of the suit premises, i.e., front portion forming part of premises No.C-25, Friends Colony, New Delhi as shown red in the site plan annexed with the plaint. File be sent to RR. Sd/Civil Judge"" Accordingly, a fresh decree was drawn on 18.7.2001 in terms of the final order dated 23.5.2001. 6. On 21.8.2001, second defendant (Pushpa Devi) filed an application under section 151 CPC for setting aside the decree dated 18.7.2001 alleging that she had not instructed her counsel Shri Dinesh Garg to enter into any compromise on her behalf that there was no ""written compromise between the parties duly signed by the parties"", and therefore, there was no lawful agreement or compromise. The court issued notice of the said application to Shri Dinesh Garg, counsel for the defendants as also the plaintiffs. Shri Dinesh Garg filed a detailed statement dated 7.12.2001. We extract below the relevant portions of the said statement : ""The counsel had represented the defendant no. 2 for about 12 years in the aforesaid matter. The counsel was getting the instructions from the defendant no. 2 most of times through her daughter Ms. Sadhna Rai or her son in law, Shri Vinay Rai or through Group Head of Law Department Dr. M.C. Gupta. All the proceedings were always communicated to the defendant no.2. After the closing of evidence by the plaintiff, the case was listed for the defendant’s evidence time and again and under instructions of the defendant no. 2, the counsel took adjournments for evidence for several years. The adjournment were taken on 4.12.1998, 5.4.1999 and 21.5.1999. When the case fixed for 12.7.1999 for evidence of defendant no. 2, she again did not come and sent her medical  Page 4 of 14 certificate which was placed on record and case was adjourned to 8.9.1999. Again adjournment was sought and the case was adjourned to 22.10.1999 as last and final opportunity for her evidence. A written communication dated 20.9.1999 was sent by registered post to defendant no. 2, but she did not appear. Again adjournment was sought as per her instructions and this time the case was adjourned for 30.11.1999 for her evidence subject to cost of Rs.500/- which was paid by her but still she did not appear in witness box. Even thereafter case was adjourned on 13.1.2000, 24.4.2000, 7.7.2000, 4.9.2000, 16.10.2000, 20.12.2000 and 26.4.2001 for evidence of remaining defendants but none appeared in witness box. After contesting the matter for about 10 years when it was not possible to take any further date for recording of the evidence of the defendants, the counsel advised the defendant no. 2 to lead evidence and made it clear that it will not be possible the counsel to meet any further adjournment. However, she requested for getting her some time to enable her to find an alternative accommodation. The counsel took her oral instructions under good faith and because of level of confidence developed after representing Usha Group for about 18 years, started negotiations with the plaintiff which went on for several months, during which period there were several offers and counter offers duly communicated to the defendants. Ultimately when plaintiff came out with plea to first clear the arrears of rent with effect from 01.10.1999, the counsel asked defendant no. 2 to clear the arrears which were sent to counsel vide communication of their Law Officer dated 9.4.2001 through the Head of Law Department Dr. M.C. Gupta. After that, the term are negotiated and ultimately, with prior approval of defendant no. 2 a statement was made on behalf of the defendant no. 2 as well on behalf of the other defendants and the decree was obtained based on admission. Pursuant to request of the counsel, the plaintiff as well as this Hon’ble Court was pleased to allow time upto 22.1.2002 to the defendants to vacate the premises. Immediately after recording of the statement, a written communication dated 24.5.2001 was sent to the defendant no. 2 as well as to Dr. M.C. Gupta, Head of the Law Department of Usha Group of Companies was sent by Registered A.D. post clearly indicating therein that a statement has been made as per the instructions and that the decree has been passed. This communication was duly received by the defendant no. 2 as well as Dr. M.C. Gupta. The copy of the letter, postal receipts and the AD card duly signed by the defendant as received are annexed."" 7. The second defendant did not, however, pursue her application dated 21.8.2001 for setting aside the consent decree. On 27.8.2001, within six days of filing the application dated 21.8.2001 before the trial court for setting aside the decree, the  Page 5 of 14 second defendant filed an appeal against the said consent decree before the District Judge, Delhi. The appellate court by judgment dated 21.12.2002 set aside the consent decree on the ground that there was no agreement or compromise reduced to writing and signed by the parties. The matter was remanded to the trial court with a direction to proceed with the trial of the suit in accordance with the law by ignoring the statement of the counsel made on 23.5.2001. 8. The said judgment of the Appellate Court was challenged by the landlords in FAO No. 247 of 2003 on the file of the Delhi High Court, under Order 43 Rule (1)(u) of CPC. During the pendency of the said appeal before the High Court, Pushpa Devi died, and her daughter (the Appellant) came on record and pursued the appeal. The High Court allowed the landlords’ appeal by judgment dated 3.3.2004. The High Court held that the consent decree in question did not fall under the first part of Rule 3 of Order 23 (requiring an agreement or compromise between the parties to be in writing and signed by the parties), but fell under the second part of Rule 3 of Order 23 (relating to satisfaction of the claim of the plaintiff, which did not require any document in writing signed by the parties), and that there was a valid compromise under Order 23 Rule 3 CPC and the second defendant ""could not repudiate the consensus by attempting to challenge their satisfaction"". From the fact that the second defendant did not pursue the application dated 21.8.2001 filed before the trial court, and from the fact that she did not challenge the integrity of her counsel (who entered into the compromise) either before the appellate court or before it, the High Court drew an inference that second defendant’s counsel Sri Dinesh Garg, had the authority on her behalf to make the statement leading to the consent decree. 9. The judgment of the High Court is challenged by the appellant (second defendant’s legal representative) in this appeal. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the High Court having held that the case did not fall under the first part of Rule 3 of Order 23, committed a serious error in holding that the case fell under the second part of the said Rule. It is contended that the second part applies only where the defendant satisfies the plaintiff in regard to the whole or part of the subject matter of the suit. It is pointed out that the second part refers to completed acts, that is acts which have been already executed or performed, where nothing more remains to be done in future by a defendant. He submitted that in this case when the counsel for the defendants agreed to vacate the suit premises on a future date, that is on or before 22.1.2002, it was a promise or an agreement to do an act in future to satisfy the suit claim, and not a case where ""defendant satisfies the plaintiff in respect of the subject matter of the suit"". He pointed out that if the defendants had vacated and delivered the premises to the plaintiffs and thereafter the counsel for the defendants had confirmed the same and the suit had been disposed of recording the said submission, then it would fall under the second part. The appellant contends that the High Court having held that the case did not fall under the first part of Rule 3, and the case demonstrably not falling under the second part of Rule 3, it has to be held that there was no lawful agreement or compromise. It is submitted that the first appellate court was justified in setting aside the consent decree and remanding the matter to the trial court. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the landlords contended that the District Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal against a consent decree. It is also contended that there was a compromise by admitting the claim of the plaintiffs, and, therefore, the consequential decree is valid and binding. On  Page 6 of 14 the contentions raised, the following two questions arise for consideration : (i) Whether the appeal filed by Pushpa Devi under section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, against the consent decree was maintainable. (ii) Whether the compromise on 23.5.2001 resulting in a consent decree dated 18.7.2001 was not a valid compromise under Order 23 Rule 3 CPC. Re : Point No. (i) 10. It is no doubt true that the landlords did not contend either before the first appellate court or before the High Court that the appeal against the consent decree was not maintainable. This contention is urged for the first time in this Court. The contention relates to jurisdiction of the appellate court and is evident from the record. Such a plea does not require any evidence. Further, being a contention relating to the jurisdiction of the appellate court, it does not require any ’pleading’. Though this Court will not normally permit a new plea to be raised at the hearing of the special leave petition or an appeal under Article 136, where such plea does not involve any question of fact or amendment of pleading and is purely one of law, particularly relating to jurisdiction of the appellate court, it can be entertained by this Court. (See Shanti Devi vs. Bimla Devi - AIR 1988 SC 2141 and Zahoor vs. State of U.P - AIR 1991 SC 41). In Hiralal vs. Kasturi Devi [AIR 1967 SC 1853], this Court observed : ""\005\005\005\005\005. though the question of jurisdiction had not been urged before the High Court, it stares one in the face of the judgment of the appellate court. We are satisfied that the appellate court had no jurisdiction \005\005\005\005\005 though this point was not raised in the High Court, it is so obvious that we have permitted the plea to be raised before us."" In this case, the contention raised being one relating to jurisdiction of the appellate court, we have permitted the said contention and heard both sides thereon. 11. Section 96 provides for appeals from original decrees. Sub-section (3) of section 96, however, provided that no appeal shall lie from a decree passed by the court with the consent of the parties. We may notice here that Order 43 Rule 1 (m) of CPC had earlier provided for an appeal against the order under Rule 3 Order 23 recording or refusing to record an agreement, compromise or satisfaction. But clause (m) of Rule 1 Order 43 was omitted by Act 104 of 1976 with effect from 1.2.1977. Simultaneously, a proviso was added to Rule 3 Order 23 with effect from 1.2.1977. We extract below the relevant portion of the said proviso : ""Provided that where it is alleged by one party and denied by the other that an adjustment or satisfaction has been arrived at, the court shall decide the question\005"" Rule 3A was also added in Order 23 with effect from 1.2.1977 barring any suit to set aside a decree on the ground that the compromise on which the decree is based was not lawful. 12. The position that emerges from the amended provisions of  Page 7 of 14 Order 23, can be summed up thus : (i) No appeal is maintainable against a consent decree having regard to the specific bar contained in section 96(3) CPC. (ii) No appeal is maintainable against the order of the court recording the compromise (or refusing to record a compromise) in view of the deletion of clause (m) Rule 1 Order 43. (iii) No independent suit can be filed for setting aside a compromise decree on the ground that the compromise was not lawful in view of the bar contained in Rule 3A. (iv) A consent decree operates as an estoppel and is valid and binding unless it is set aside by the court which passed the consent decree, by an order on an application under the proviso to Rule 3 of Order 23. Therefore, the only remedy available to a party to a consent decree to avoid such consent decree, is to approach the court which recorded the compromise and made a decree in terms of it, and establish that there was no compromise. In that event, the court which recorded the compromise will itself consider and decide the question as to whether there was a valid compromise or not. This is so because a consent decree, is nothing but contract between parties superimposed with the seal of approval of the court. The validity of a consent decree depends wholly on the validity of the agreement or compromise on which it is made. The second defendant, who challenged the consent compromise decree was fully aware of this position as she filed an application for setting aside the consent decree on 21.8.2001 by alleging that there was no valid compromise in accordance with law. Significantly, none of the other defendants challenged the consent decree. For reasons best known to herself, the second defendant within a few days thereafter (that is on 27.8.2001), filed an appeal and chose not to pursue the application filed before the court which passed the consent decree. Such an appeal by second defendant was not maintainable, having regard to the express bar contained in section 96 (3) of the Code. Re : Point No. (ii) 13. Order XXIII deals with withdrawal and adjustment of suits. Rule 3 relates to compromise of suits, relevant portion of which is extracted below : ""3. Compromise of suit.\027Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that a suit has been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise in writing and signed by the parties, or where the defendant satisfies the plaintiff in respect of the whole or any part of the subject matter of the suit, the Court shall order such agreement, compromise or satisfaction to be recorded, and shall pass a decree in accordance therewith so far as it relates to the parties to the suit, whether or not the subject-matter of the agreement, compromise or satisfaction is the same as the subject-matter of the suit."" The said Rule consists of two parts. The first part provides that  Page 8 of 14 where it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that a suit has been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise in writing and signed by the parties, the court shall order such agreement or compromise to be recorded and shall pass a decree in accordance therewith. The second part provides that where a defendant satisfies the plaintiff in respect of the whole or any part of the subject matter of the suit, the court shall order such satisfaction to be recorded and shall pass a decree in accordance therewith. The Rule also makes it clear that the compromise or agreement may relate to issues or disputes which are not the subject-matter of the suit and that such compromise or agreement may be entered not only among the parties to the suit, but others also, but the decree to be passed shall be confined to the parties to the suit whether or not the subject matter of the agreement, compromise or satisfaction is the same as the subject matter of the suit. We are not, however, concerned with this aspect of the Rule in this appeal. 14. What is the difference between the first part and the second part of Rule 3 ? The first part refers to situations where an agreement or compromise is entered into in writing and signed by the parties. The said agreement or compromise is placed before the court. When the court is satisfied that the suit has been adjusted either wholly or in part by such agreement or compromise in writing and signed by the parties and that it is lawful, a decree follows in terms of what is agreed between the parties. The agreement/compromise spells out the agreed terms by which the claim is admitted or adjusted by mutual concessions or promises, so that the parties thereto can be held to their promise/s in future and performance can be enforced by the execution of the decree to be passed in terms of it. On the other hand, the second part refers to cases where the defendant has satisfied the plaintiff about the claim. This may be by satisfying the plaintiff that his claim cannot be or need not be met or performed. It can also be by discharging or performing the required obligation. Where the defendant so ’satisfies’ the plaintiff in respect of the subject-matter of the suit, nothing further remains to be done or enforced and there is no question of any ’enforcement’ or ’execution’ of the decree to be passed in terms of it. Let us illustrate with reference to a money-suit filed for recovery of say a sum of Rupees one lakh. Parties may enter into a lawful agreement or compromise in writing and signed by them, agreeing that the defendant will pay the sum of Rupees one lakh within a specified period or specified manner or may agree that only a sum of Rs.75,000 shall be paid by the defendant in full and final settlement of the claim. Such agreement or compromise will fall under the first Part and if defendant does not fulfil the promise, the plaintiff can enforce it by levying execution. On the other hand, the parties may submit to the court that defendant has already paid a sum of Rupees one lakh or Rs.75,000/- in full and final satisfaction or that the suit claim has been fully settled by the defendant out of court (either by mentioning the amount paid or not mentioning it) or that plaintiff will not press the claim. Here the obligation is already performed by the defendant or plaintiff agrees that he will not enforce performance and nothing remains to be performed by the defendant. As the order that follows merely records the extinguishment or satisfaction of the claim or non existence of the claim, it is not capable of being ’enforced’ by levy of execution, as there is no obligation to be performed by the defendant in pursuance of the decree. Such ’satisfaction’ need not be expressed by an agreement or compromise in writing and signed by the parties. It can be by a unilateral submission by the plaintiff or his counsel. Such satisfaction will  Page 9 of 14 fall under the second part. Of course even when there is such satisfaction of the claim or subject matter of the suit by defendant and the matter falls under the second part, nothing prevents the parties from reducing such satisfaction of the claim/subject matter, into writing and signing the same. The difference between the two parts is this : Where the matter falls under the second part, what is reported is a completed action or settlement out of court putting an end to the dispute, and the resultant decree recording the satisfaction, is not capable of being enforced by levying execution. Where the matter falls under the first part, there is a promise or promises agreed to be performed or executed, and that can be enforced by levying execution. While agreements or compromises falling under the first part, can only be by an instrument or other form of writing signed by the parties, there is no such requirement in regard to settlements or satisfaction falling under the second part. Where the matter falls under second part, it is sufficient if the plaintiff or plaintiff’s counsel appears before the court and informs the court that the subject matter of the suit has already been settled or satisfied. 15. In a suit against the tenant for possession, if the settlement is that the tenant will vacate the premises within a specified time, it means that the possession could be recovered in execution of such decree in the event of the defendant failing to vacate the premises within the time agreed. Therefore, such settlement would fall under the first part. On the other hand, if both parties or the plaintiff submit to the court that the tenant has already vacated the premises and thus the claim for possession has been satisfied or if the plaintiff submits that he will not press the prayer for delivery of possession, the suit will be disposed of recording the same, under the second part. In such an event, there will be disposal of the suit, but no ’executable’ decree. 16. In this case, under the settlement, the tenant undertook to vacate the suit property on a future date (that is 22.1.2002) and pay the agreed rent till then. The decree in pursuance of such settlement was an ’executable’ decree. Therefore the settlement did not fall under the second part, but under the first part of Rule 3. The High Court obviously committed an error in holding that the case fell under the second part of Rule 3. 17. The next question is where an agreement or compromise falls under the first part, what is the meaning and significance of the words ’in writing’ and ’signed by the parties’ occurring in Rule 3 ? The appellant contends that the words ’in writing’ and ’signed by the parties’ would contemplate drawing up of a document or instrument or a compromise petition containing the terms of the settlement in writing and signed by the parties. The appellant points out that in this case, there is no such instrument, document or petition in writing and signed by the parties. 18. We will first consider the meaning of the words ""signed by parties"". Order 3 Rule 1 of CPC provides that any appearance, application or act in or to any Court, required or authorized by law to be made or done by a party in such Court, may, except where otherwise expressly provided by any law for the time being in force, be made or done by the party in person, or by his recognized agent, or by a pleader appearing, applying or acting, as the case may be, on his behalf. The proviso thereto makes it clear that the Court can, if it so desires, direct that such appearance shall be made by the party in person. Rule 4 provides that no pleader shall act for any person in any Court,   14 unless he has been appointed for the purpose by such person by a document in writing signed by such person or by his recognized agent or by some other person duly authorized by or under a power-of-attorney to make such appointment. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 4 provides that every such appointment shall be filed in Court and shall, for the purposes of sub-rule (1), be deemed to be in force until determined with the leave of the Court by a writing signed by the client or the pleader, as the case may be, and filed in Court, or until the client or the pleader dies, or until all proceedings in the suit are ended so far as regards the client. The question whether ’signed by parties’ would include signing by the pleader was considered by this Court in Byram Pestonji Gariwala v. Union Bank of India [1992 (1) SCC 31] with reference to Order 3 of CPC : ""30. There is no reason to assume that the legislature intended to curtail the implied authority of counsel, engaged in the thick of proceedings in court, to compromise or agree on matters relating to the parties, even if such matters exceed the subject matter of the suit. The relationship of counsel and his party or the recognized agent and his principal is a matter of contract; and with the freedom of contract generally, the legislature does not interfere except when warranted by public policy, and the legislative intent is expressly made manifest. There is no such declaration of policy or indication of intent in the present case. The legislature has not evinced any intention to change the well recognized and universally acclaimed common law tradition \005 x x x x x 35. So long as the system of judicial administration in India continues unaltered, and so long as Parliament has not evinced an intention to change its basic character, there is no reason to assume that Parliament has, though not expressly, but impliedly reduced counsel’s role or capacity to represent his client as effectively as in the past\005 x x x x x 37. We may, however, hasten to add that it will be prudent for counsel not to act on implied authority except when warranted by the exigency of circumstances demanding immediate adjustment of suit by agreement of compromise and the signature of the party cannot be obtained without undue delay. In these days of easier and quicker communication, such contingency may seldom arise. A wise and careful counsel will no doubt arm himself in advance with the necessary authority expressed in writing to meet all such contingencies in order that neither his authority nor integrity is ever doubted\005 38. Considering the traditionally recognized role of counsel in the common law system, and the evil sought to be remedied by Parliament by the C.P.C. (Amendment) Act, 1976, namely, attainment of certainty and expeditious disposal of cases by reducing the terms of compromise to writing signed by the parties, and allowing   of 14 the compromise decree to comprehend even matters falling outside the subject matter of the suit, but relating to the parties, the legislature cannot, in the absence of express words to such effect, be presumed to have disallowed the parties to enter into a compromise by counsel in their cause or by their duly authorized agents. 39. To insist upon the party himself personally signing the agreement or compromise would often cause undue delay, loss and inconvenience, especially in the case of non-resident persons. It has always been universally understood that a party can always act by his duly authorized representative. If a power-of-attorney holder can enter into an agreement or compromise on behalf of his principal, so can counsel, possessed of the requisite authorization by vakalatnama, act on behalf of his client\005.. If the legislature had intended to make such a fundamental change, even at the risk of delay, inconvenience and needless expenditure, it would have expressly so stated."" [Emphasis supplied] The above view was reiterated in Jineshwardas v. Jagrani [2003 (11) SCC 372]. Therefore, the words ’by parties’ refer not only to parties in person, but their attorney holders or duly authorized pleaders. 19. Let us now turn to the requirement of ’in writing’ in Rule 3. In this case as noticed above, the respective statements of plaintiffs’ counsel and defendants’ counsel were recorded on oath by the trial court in regard to the terms of the compromise and those statements after being read over and accepted to be correct, were signed by the said counsel. If the terms of a compromise written on a paper in the form of an application or petition is considered as a compromise in writing, can it be said that the specific and categorical statements on oath recorded in writing by the court and duly read over and accepted to be correct by the person making the statement and signed by him, can be said to be not in writing? Obviously, no. We may also in this behalf refer to Section 3 of the Evidence Act which defines a document as any matter expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures or marks or by more than one of those means intended to be used or which may be used for the purpose of recording the matter. The statements recorded by the court will, therefore, amount to a compromise in writing. 20. Consequently, the statements of the parties or their counsel, recorded by the court and duly signed by the persons making the statements, would be ’statement in writing signed by the parties’. The court, however, has to satisfy itself that the terms of the compromise are lawful. In this case we find from the trial court records that the second defendant had executed a vakalatnama empowering her counsel Sri Dinesh Garg to act for her in respect of the suit and also to enter into any compromise. Hence there can be no doubt that Sri Dinesh Garg was authorized by the second defendant to enter into a compromise. We also find that the counsel for the plaintiffs and counsel for the defendants made solemn statements on oath before the trial court specifying the terms of compromise, which were duly recorded in writing and signed by them. The requirements of the   of 14 first part of Rule 3 of Order XXIII are fully satisfied in this case. 21. The matter can be viewed from a different angle also. After the issues were framed by the trial court, the plaintiffs had examined two witnesses and closed their evidence and thereafter the matter was set down for the evidence of defendants. The first defendant was treated as ex parte. As defendants 2 and 3 did not lead any evidence in spite of numerous opportunities, their evidence was treated as closed. On 17.5.2001, the matter was finally adjourned to 23.5.2001 for the evidence of defendants 4 and 5 with a condition that if they do not lead evidence on that date there evidence will be closed. On 23.5.2001, defendants 4 and 5 did not lead any evidence. On the other hand, the counsel for defendants made a statement on oath that the premises will be vacated on 22.1.2002. Thereafter, counsel for the plaintiff also made a statement agreeing to grant of time till 21.1.2002. There was also agreement that the plaintiffs will be entitled to the payment of only Rs.4,800/- per month (equivalent to the rent) and nothing more up to 22.1.2002. The effect of it is that the parties have gone to trial on the issues and the only evidence led by defendants is that they will vacate the premises on 22.1.2002. No other evidence being led, the necessary conclusion is that the defendants admitted the plaintiffs’ claim and merely sought time to vacate. Therefore, the suit can be said to have been decreed on the basis of evidence and the admissions made by the defendants. In Jineshwardas (supra), such a situation was noticed. In that case, the High Court made an order on a consensus expressed by both the learned counsel at the time of hearing of the second appeal, that the respondents will pay Rs.25,000/- within a period of one month with interest in the manner stipulated. The appellant subsequently filed an application for review, contending that the said order disposing of the appeal was a compromise decree, and as it was not in writing and signed by the parties, the appeal could not have been disposed of on the basis of the submissions. The High Court, however, refused to entertain such objections. This Court while upholding the decision of the High Court and holding that there was a valid compromise, also observed : ""That apart, we are also of the view that a judgment or decree passed as a result of consensus arrived at before court, cannot always be said to be one passed on compromise or settlement and adjustment. It may, at times, be also a judgment on admission, as in this case."" 22. Strong reliance was placed by the appellant on the following observations of this Court in Gurpreet Singh v. Chatur Bhuj Goel [1988 (1) SCC 270] to contend that a compromise should be reduced into writing in the form of an ’instrument’ and signed by the parties to be valid under Order 23 Rule 3. He submitted that recording of the statements of the parties or their counsel, would not be an instrument of compromise. An ’instrument’, according to him, connotes a regular document drawn up in the form of an agreement. We extract below the observations relied on by the appellant : ""10. Under Rule 3 as it now stands, when a claim in suit has been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise, the compromise must be in writing and signed by the parties and there must be a completed agreement between them. To constitute an  Page 13 of 14 adjustment, an agreement or compromise must itself be capable of being embodied in a decree. When the parties enter into a compromise during the hearing of a suit or appeal, there is no reason why the requirement that the compromise should be reduced in writing in the form of an instrument signed by the parties should be dispensed with. The court must therefore insist upon the parties to reduce the terms into writing."" We have already referred to the definition of the term document. The term instrument used in Gurpreet Singh (supra) refers to a writing of a formal nature and nothing more. Further, we will have to understand the observations in the context in which they were made. In that case when the hearing of a Letters Patent Appeal commenced before the High Court, the parties took time to explore the possibility of a settlement. When the hearing was resumed the appellant’s father made an offer for settlement which was endorsed by counsel for the appellant also. The respondent who was present also made a statement accepting the offer. Evidently, the said offer and acceptance were not treated as final as the appeal was not disposed of by recording those terms. On the other hand, the said ’proposals’ were recorded and the matter adjourned for payment in terms of the offer. When the matter was taken up on the next date of hearing, the respondent stated that he was not agreeable. The High Court directed that the appeal will have to be heard on merits as the respondent was not prepared to abide by the proposed compromise. That order was challenged by the appellant by contending that the matter was settled by a lawful compromise by recording the statements of the appellant’s counsel and respondent’s counsel, and the respondent could not resile from such compromise and therefore, the High Court ought to have disposed of the appeal in terms of the compromise. It is in this factual background, that is, where there was no consent decree, the question was considered by this Court. The distinguishing feature in that case is that though the submissions made were recorded, they were not signed by the parties or their counsel. Nor did the court treat the submissions as a compromise. In this case, the court not only recorded the terms of settlement but thereafter directed that the statements of the counsel be recorded. Thereafter, the statements of counsel were recorded on oath, read over and accepted by the counsel to be correct and then signed by both counsel. Therefore in this case, there is a valid compromise in writing and signed by the parties (represented counsel). The decision in Gurpreet Singh (supra) is therefore of no assistance to the appellant. 23. At the cost of repetition, we may recapitulate the facts of this case. The suit was a simple suit for possession by a landlord against a tenant filed in the year 1993. Plaintiff’s evidence was closed in 1998. The contesting defendant (defendant No.2) did not lead any evidence, and her evidence was treated as closed. The matter was dragged on for 3 years for defendant’s evidence after the conclusion of plaintiff’s evidence. It was noted on 19.5.2001 that no further adjournment will be granted for the evidence of defendants 4 and 5 (who are not contesting the matter), on the next date of hearing (23.5.2001). When the matter finally came up on 23.5.2001, no evidence was tendered. On the other hand, a statement was made agreeing to vacate the premises by 22.1.2002. The trial court took care to ensure that the statements of both counsel were recorded on oath and signed. Thereafter, it passed a consent decree. The attempts of  Page 14 of 14 tenants in such matters to protract the litigation indefinitely by raising frivolous and vexatious contentions regarding the compromise and going back on the solemn undertaking given to court, should be deprecated. In this context, we may refer to the observation made by this Court a similar situation in Smt. Jamilabai Abdul Kadar v. Shankarlal Gulabchand [AIR 1975 SC 2202] : ""23. On the facts of the present case we have little doubt the pleader has acted substantially with the knowledge of and encouraged by his client. x x x x x 24. We feel no doubt that the broad sanction for the compromise came from the tenant., that no shady action is imputable to respondent 4 and that his conduct has been motivated by the good of his client. 25. The last posting was for reporting the compromise. But, on that date, the Court declined further adjournment and the party being absent and away, the pleader for the appellant had no alternative but to suffer an eviction decree or settle it to the maximum advantage of his party. \005"" Similar are the facts here. Neither the second defendant nor her legal representative has attributed any improper motive to second defendant’s counsel. The facts go to show nothing further could have been done for the defendants-tenants. All that the counsel for defendants had done was to get the maximum advantage to his clients in the circumstances after dragging on the matter to the extent possible. 24. This appeal is, therefore, liable to be dismissed as being devoid of merit. The consent decree is upheld, though for reasons different from those which weighed with the High Court. The landlords (respondents) will be entitled to seek mesne profits for the period from 22.1.2002 to date of delivery of possession in accordance with law. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs. The costs payable by the appellant are quantified at Rs.25,000/-."

These appeals, by special leave, have been filed challenging the judgment and order dated 6.4.2004 of a Division Bench of Karnataka High Court by which writ appeals filed by the appellants were dismissed and the judgment and order dated 28.1.2004 of the learned Single Judge dismissing the writ petitions was affirmed. The subject matter of challenge in the writ petitions were two notifications issued under Section 28(1) and 28(4) of Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as ’the Act’). 3. The impugned notifications were issued for acquisition of land for establishment and development of industries by the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board. Before adverting to the contention raised by the learned counsel for the parties, it will be convenient to reproduce the impugned notifications. The first notification bears No.CI:289:SPQ:2001 and was issued on 10.12.2001, relevant part whereof, is reproduced below : ""INDUSTRIES AND COMMERCE SECRETARIAT NOTIFICATION NO:CI:289:SPQ:2001, Bangalore, Dated 10th Dec 2001 The below mentioned lands specified are required for the State government for establishment and development of industries by the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board. With an intention of acquiring the lands notification is hereby published according to Section 28(1) (Act No.18 of 1966) of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966. According to Section 25 of the Act ......................... ................................................... (Omitted as not relevant) From the date of publication of this notification ..... ................................................... (Omitted as not relevant) The map of the lands comprised therein is kept in the office of the Special Land Acquisition Officer, KIADB."" The second notification under Section 28(4) of the Act bears No.CPMG/KA/BG-GPO/13/2003-05 and was issued on 23.10.2003. The relevant part of the notification is being reproduced below : Notification under Section 28(4) Where as it appears, to the State Government that the Lands are to be acquired specified in the schedule here to   of 10 likely to be needed for the purpose stated in the notification No. CI-289 SPQ 2001 dated 10.12.2001 published in Karnataka Gazette part 3-1 page 4 to 11 in exercise of powers conferred according to section 28(1) of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (Karnataka Act No. 18 of 1966). The State Government is satisfied that Lands specified in the schedule of Notification be acquired for the purpose specified as such orders are passed according to section (3). In exercise of the powers conferred according to section 28(4) (Act No. 18 of 1966) of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966 the Karnataka Government is acquiring said Lands below for the purpose specified in the notification as such a declaration is made."" By the notification under Section 28(1) of the Act 110.30 acres of land was proposed to be acquired but by the notification under Section 28(4) of the Act, the acquisition was restricted to an extent of 106 acres 12.3/4 guntas of land. Some of the land owners had challenged the preliminary notification by filing writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Karnataka High Court after orders had been passed under Section 28(3)of the Act. The writ petitions were allowed and the orders passed under Section 28(3) of the Act were quashed giving liberty to proceed with the acquisition from the stage of preliminary notification. Thereafter, the Land Acquisition Officer, after giving an opportunity of hearing to the landowners on the objections filed by them, passed a detailed order and then the notification under Section 28(4) of the Act was issued. 4. Shri Shanti Bhushan, learned senior counsel for the appellants, has challenged the impugned notifications on several grounds and the principal ground is that the land has been acquired in order to benefit a company, namely, Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. (respondent no.9) who had submitted a project report for setting up a software technology park which included an I.T. Training Institute/Engineering College, Research and Development Centre, Educational Centre, Commercial and Residential Buildings and Service Apartments, Convention Centre, Hotel, Shopping Mall, etc. In the notification under Section 28(1) of the Act, the purpose of acquisition, namely, the purpose for which the company, Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. wanted the land, as enumerated above, was not mentioned and, therefore, the appellant landowners were kept in dark and did not get an adequate opportunity to make an effective objection against the proposed acquisition. Learned counsel has submitted that the notification being absolutely vague and cryptic, it deprived the landowners of a valuable right of making an effective representation and in these circumstances the entire acquisition proceedings are illegal and the impugned notifications are liable to be struck down. 5. Shri L. Nageshwara Rao, learned senior counsel for Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (respondent no.2) (hereinafter referred to as ’KIADB’), has submitted that the land was actually acquired by the State Government for industrial development and after acquisition of the land, the same vests with the KIADB which has the authority to give the same on leasehold basis or outright sale to entrepreneurs or companies for the purpose of industrial development and the basic object of acquisition is to promote the establishment and orderly development of industries in that area. Learned counsel has further submitted that the impugned notification did not suffer from any vagueness and clearly indicated the purpose for which the land was sought to be acquired and there is no illegality in the same. He has also urged that the mere fact that a substantial area of the land was subsequently given on lease to a company, Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd., it was not at all obligatory to specifically mention the details of the project which the said company wanted to establish. Learned counsel for the State of Karnataka and also Shri A.  Page 3 of 10 Sundaram, learned senior counsel for Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. (respondent no.9) supported the stand taken by learned counsel for KIADB and submitted that the impugned notifications fully satisfied the requirements of the Act and the Act did not contemplate that at the time of acquisition of the land, the details of the project which was to be set up by the lessees or the subsequent purchasers from the KIADB should also be mentioned in the notifications. 6. In order to examine the contentions advanced by learned counsel for the parties, it is necessary to notice the provisions of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act. The preamble of the Act reads as under : ""An Act to make special provisions for securing the establishment of industrial areas in the State of Karnataka and generally to promote the establishment and orderly development of industries therein, and for that purpose to establish an Industrial Areas Development Board and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid."" Some of the provisions of the Act, which are relevant for the decision of the issue involved, are as under: ""Section 2 \026 Definitions: - In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, (1) ""amenity"" includes road, supply of water or electricity, street lighting, drainage, sewerage, conservancy, and such other convenience, as the State Government may, by notification specify to be an amenity for the purposes of this Act; (2) ""Board"" means the Industrial Areas Development Board established under this Act; (3) ......................................................................... (4) ........................................................................ (5) ""development"" with its grammatical variations means the carrying out of levelling, digging, building, engineering, quarrying or other operations in, on, over or under land, or the making of any material change in any building or land, and includes re-development; and ""to develop"" shall be construed accordingly; (6) ""industrial area"" means any area declared to be an industrial area by the State Government by notification which is to be developed and where industries are to be accommodated and industrial infrastructural facilities and amenities are to be provided and includes, an industrial estate; (7) ""industrial estate"" means any site selected by the State Government where factories and other buildings are built for use by any industries or class of industries; (7a) ""industrial infrastructural facilities’’ means facilities which contribute to the development of industries established in industrial area such as research and development, communication, transport, Banking, Marketing, Technology parks and Townships for the purpose of establishing trade and tourism centres; and any other facility as the State Government may by notification specify to be an industrial infrastructural facility for the purposes of this Act. Section 3 - Declaration of industrial areas: - (1) The State Government may, by notification, declare any area in the State to be an industrial area for the purposes of this Act. (2) Every such notification shall define the limits of the area to which it relates. Section 5 - Establishment and incorporation: -  Page 4 of 10 (1) For the purposes of securing the establishment of industrial areas in the State of Karnataka and generally for promoting the rapid and orderly establishment and development of industries and for providing industrial infrastructual facilities and amenity in industrial areas in the State of Karnataka, there shall be established by the State Government by notification a Board by the name of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board. (2) The said Board shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal, and may sue and be sued in its corporate name, and shall subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder be competent to acquire, hold and dispose of property, both movable and immovable, and to contract and do all things necessary for the purposes of this Act. Section 14 - General powers of the Board: - Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Board shall have power: (a) to acquire and hold such property, both movable and immovable as the Board may deem necessary for the performance of any of its activities and to lease, sell, exchange or otherwise transfer any property held by it on such conditions as may be deemed proper by the Board; (b) ........................................................................ (c) to provide or cause to be provided amenities, industrial infrastructural facilities and common facilities in industrial areas and construct and maintain or cause to be maintained works and buildings therefor; Section 28 - Acquisition of land: - (1) If at any time, in the opinion of the State Government, any land is required for the purpose of development by the Board, or for any other purpose in furtherance of the objects of this Act, the State Government may by notification, give notice of its intention to acquire such land. (2) On publication of a notification under sub-section (1), the State Government shall serve notice upon the owner or where the owner is not the occupier, on the occupier of the land and on all such persons known or believed to be interested therein to show cause, within thirty days from the date of service of the notice, why the land should not be acquired. (3) After considering the cause, if any, shown by the owner of the land and by any other person interested therein, and after giving such owner and person an opportunity of being heard, the State Government may pass such orders as it deems fit. (4) After orders are passed under sub-section (3), where the State Government is satisfied that any land should be acquired for the purpose specified in the notification issued under sub-section (1), a declaration shall, by notification in the official Gazette, be made to that effect. (5) On the publication in the official Gazette of the declaration under sub-section (4), the land shall vest absolutely in the State Government free from all encumbrances. (6) ......................................................................... (7) ......................................................................... (8) Where the land has been acquired for the Board, the State Government, after it has taken possession of the land, may transfer the land to the Board for the purpose for which the land has been acquired.""  Page 5 of 10 Section 29 provides that where the land is acquired by the State Government under Chapter VII (Sections 27 to 31), the compensation for acquisition shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Section 30 provides that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act shall mutatis mutandis apply in respect of the enquiry and award by the Deputy Commissioner, the reference to Court, the apportionment of compensation and payment of compensation in respect of lands acquired under this Chapter. It is important to note that the Land Acquisition Act is not applicable at the stage of acquisition of the land but becomes applicable only in the matter of payment of compensation on account of Section 30 of the Act. Therefore, the provisions of Sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act have no application here and acquisition of land has to be done in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 7. The Preamble of the Act shows that it has been enacted to make special provisions for securing the establishment of industrial areas and generally to promote the establishment and the orderly development of the industries in such industrial areas. Section 2(7a) defines industrial infrastructural facilities. This provision was inserted on 19.2.1997 by an amendment made by Act No.11 of 1997. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the amending Act has some relevance and the same is being reproduced below : ""After the liberalization of economic and industrial policies in the year 1991 increased emphasis has been given for Private Sector Investment not only in the Industrial Sector but also in the Infrastructural Sectors. As such a number of proposals, both from indigenous and foreign companies have been received for considerable investments in infrastructural areas like establishment of power projects, express highways, ports, airports, townships, industrial parks etc. These projects need considerable extent of land for implementation. Therefore, it is considered necessary to amend the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966, to enable the Board to acquire land for providing Industrial Infrastructural Facilities."" As the definition shows, anything which contributes to the development of industries in industrial areas like technology parks, townships for the purpose of establishing trade and tourism centres and any other facility as the State Government may notify, will be an industrial infrastructural facility. It, therefore, shows that the object of the Act is not only to secure establishment of industrial areas and orderly development of industries therein, but also to create facilities which contribute to the development of industries which may include technology parks, townships, trade and tourism centres, etc. 9. The provision for acquisition of land under the Act is contained in Section 28 which is somewhat different from the provisions contained in Sections 4, 5A and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act. The legislature in its wisdom thought it proper to make a specific provision for acquisition of the land in the Act itself rather than to take recourse to Sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act. A plain reading of sub-section (1) of Section 28 would show that land can be acquired for the purpose of (i) development by the Board, or (ii) for any other purpose in furtherance of the objects of the Act. Sub-section (3) of Section 28 is similar to Section 5A of the Land Acquisition Act and the final notification is issued under sub-section (4) of Section 28. The necessary precondition for a valid notification under sub-section (4) of Section 28 is that the State Government should be satisfied that the land is required for the purpose specified in the notification issued under sub-section (1), viz., for the purpose of (i) development by the Board, or (ii) for any other purpose in furtherance of the objects of the Act. Therefore, in order to judge the validity of the notification what is to be seen is whether the  Page 6 of 10 acquisition of land is being made for securing the establishment of industrial areas or to promote the establishment or orderly development of industries in such areas. In view of wide definition of the words ""industrial infrastructural facilities"" as contained in Section 2 (7a) of the Act, making of a technology park, research and development centre, townships, trade and tourism centres or making provisions for marketing and banking which would contribute to the development of industries will meet the objectives of the Act and acquisition of land for such a purpose would be perfectly valid. 10. Shri Shanti Bhushan, learned senior counsel for the appellants, has strongly urged that as the impugned notification under Section 28(1) of the Act did not mention that the land was sought to be acquired for a technology park, research and development centre, shopping mall, engineering college, residential apartments, etc., the landowners could not make a proper and effective representation under Section 28(2) of the Act which deprived them of a valuable right given to them under the Act of showing cause against the proposed acquisition and consequently the notification is bad. Learned counsel has also submitted that the notification is very vague and cryptic. We are unable to accept the contention raised. Sub section (1) of Section 28 clearly shows that the land can be acquired for (i) development by the Board; or (ii) for any other purpose in furtherance of the objects of the Act. Under sub-section (8) of Section 28, the State Government is empowered, after it has taken possession of land, to transfer the same to the Board for the purpose for which the land has been acquired. Section 32 empowers the State Government to place at the disposal of the Board any land vested in it and the Board is enjoined to deal with the land in accordance with the regulations made and directions given by the State Government in this behalf. This stage when the Board gets the authority to deal with the land comes at a later stage which is after the land has been developed by it. An entrepreneur or a company may give a proposal to the State Government for setting up an industry or infrastructural facility and the Government may thereafter acquire the land and give it to the Board. It is also possible that after the land has already been acquired and developed by the Board, it may be allotted to an entrepreneur or a company for setting up an industry or infrastructural facility. Therefore, the scheme of the Act does not show that at the time of acquisition of the land and issuing a preliminary notification under Section 28(1) of the Act, the complete details of the nature of the industry or infrastructural facility proposed to be set up should also be mentioned. At that stage what is to be seen is whether the land is acquired for development by the Board or for any other purpose in furtherance of the objects of the Act, as mentioned in sub-section (1) of Section 28 of the Act. In fact, if the contention raised by the learned senior counsel for the appellants is accepted, it would mean that even at the stage of preliminary notification under Section 28(1) of the Act, the nature of the activity which may be done by some entrepreneur or a company which may give a proposal for setting up an industry or infrastructural facility much after land has been acquired should also be taken note of and specifically mentioned in the notification, which is well nigh impossible. While interpreting the provisions of the Act, the Court should not only take into consideration the facts of the present case but should also have in mind all possible contingencies. Therefore, on a plain reading of the language used in the Act, it is not possible to accept the contention of the learned senior counsel for the appellants that the impugned notification is vague or cryptic as the complete details of the project which was proposed to be established by Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. (respondent no.9) were not mentioned and on account of the aforesaid lacuna, the landowners were deprived of their right to make a proper representation or to show cause against the proposed acquisition. 11. Learned senior counsel for the appellant has placed strong  Page 7 of 10 reliance on a Three Judge Bench decision of this Court in Munshi Singh & Ors. v. Union of India (1973) 2 SCC 337 in support of his submission that the impugned notifications are vague and are, therefore, liable to be struck down. In this case a notification was issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act by the State Government on 16.7.1960 declaring its intention to acquire 34,000 acres of land in 50 villages of Ghaziabad. By a subsequent notification dated 9.2.1962, the proposed area was reduced from 34,000 acres to 6,158 acres. The appellants Munshi Singh and others made an application on 4.7.1962 to the Special Land Acquisition Officer for supplying a copy of the Scheme of the planned development to enable them to make an effective representation at the time of hearing of the objections under Section 5A of the Land Acquisition Act, but the same was rejected by an order which mentioned that ""the scheme of the planned development is not necessary for a notification under Section 4 of the Act, as such, no such scheme of the planned development is available in this office."" The Master Plan was sanctioned subsequently on 4.9.1962. The notification was challenged on the ground that the words in the notification, viz. ""for planned development of the area"", gave no indication whatsoever as to the purpose for which the land was acquired and the same was vague. It was held that there was no indication whatsoever in the notification whether the development was to be of residential area and building cities or of commercial and industrial plots nor was it possible for anyone to find out what kind of planned development was under contemplation i.e. whether the land was to be developed by the Government or whether the owners of the properties would be required to develop a particular area in a specified way. It was also held that if the Master Plan which came to be sanctioned on 4.9.1962 had been available for inspection by the persons interested or even if the knowledge of its existence on the part of the appellants had been satisfactorily proved, the position may have been different, as in that situation the landowners could not claim that they were unable to file objections owing to the lack of any indication in the notification under Section 4 of the nature of the development for which the area was being acquired. In our opinion, the authority cited is clearly distinguishable on facts. The Scheme of the planned development was not available when the notification was issued and in fact the Master Plan itself was sanctioned much after the publication of the notification and in these circumstances the words ""planned development of the area"" were clearly vague. Such is not the case here as the impugned notification clearly mentions that the land is sought to be acquired for establishment and development of industries by KIADB. The second case relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants is M.P. Housing Board v. Mohd. Shafi & Ors. (1992) 2 SCC 168. In this case, a notification was issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act to acquire 2.298 hectares of land in city/village Mandsaur, Tehsil and Distt. Mandsaur and in the column for purpose only ""residential"" was mentioned. The notification was struck down on the ground that no khasra number, locality or any other particulars of the land sought to be acquired was mentioned when Mandsaur city was spread over a large area of 25 sq. kilometers. It was also held that the word ""residential"" was hopelessly vague as it conveyed no idea about the purpose of acquisition. In our opinion, this case can be of no assistance to the appellants for the obvious reason that the no details or particular of the land like khasra number and locality had been mentioned and the word ""residential"" by itself did not show that the acquisition was being made for a public purpose, which is essential for a valid notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act. The next decision relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the appellants is State of Tamil Nadu & Ors. v. L. Krishnan & Ors. (1996) 1 SCC 250. In this case, after referring to some earlier decisions including that of Munshi Singh (supra), it was held that whether the public purpose stated in a particular notification is vague or not, is a question of fact  Page 8 of 10 to be decided in each case and cannot be treated as a question of law. 12. Shri Nageshwara Rao, learned senior counsel for KIADB has, on the other hand, relied upon a Constitution Bench decision in Babu Barkya Thakur v. State of Bombay AIR 1960 SC 1203, wherein it was held as under : ""It is not absolutely necessary to the validity of the land acquisition proceedings that the statement that the land to be acquired was needed for a public purpose should find a place in the notification actually issued. The requirements of the law will be satisfied if, in substance, it is found on investigation, and the appropriate Government is satisfied as a result of the investigation that the land was needed for the purpose of a company, which would amount to a public purpose under Part VII."" In Union of India v. Jaswant Rai Kochhar (1996) 3 SCC 491, it was held that when the notification mentioned that the land is sought to be acquired for a housing scheme but actually it is to be used for a district centre, the public purpose does not cease to be a public purpose and the notification could not be quashed on the ground that the land is sought to be used for a commercial purpose. This authority has been cited to show that even a change of purpose (from residential to commercial) would not result in invalidating the notification. Strong reliance has also been placed on Pratibha Nema & Ors. v. State of M.P. & Ors. (2003) 10 SCC 626, where the notification was challenged on the ground that it was vague and reliance was placed on the decisions rendered in M.P. Housing Board (supra) and Munshi Singh (supra) where it was observed that the public purpose ""needs to be particularized"" to satisfy the requirements of law. The Bench held as under in para 38: ""38. When no prejudice has been demonstrated nor could be reasonably inferred, it would be unjust and inappropriate to strike down the notification under Section 4(1) on the basis of a nebulous plea, in exercise of writ jurisdiction under Article 226. Even assuming that there is some ambiguity in particularizing the public purpose and the possibility of doubt cannot be ruled out, the Constitutional Courts in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 or 136 should not, as a matter of course, deal a lethal blow to the entire proceedings based on the theoretical or hypothetical grievance of the petitioner. It would be sound exercise of discretion to intervene when a real and substantial grievance is made out, the non redressal of which would cause prejudice and injustice to the aggrieved party. Vagueness of the public purpose, especially, in a matter like this where it is possible to take two views, is not something which affects the jurisdiction and it would therefore be proper to bear in mind the considerations of prejudice and injustice."" It is necessary to emphasize that all the decisions cited by learned counsel for the parties deal with notifications issued under Land Acquisition Act and as demonstrated earlier, the Scheme of the Act under our consideration is different. Even on the principle laid down in the authorities which were cited by learned counsel for the parties and which have been discussed above, it cannot be held that the impugned notifications are vague or cryptic or that they suffer from any infirmity. The challenge raised to the notifications on the aforesaid grounds must fail. 13. Learned counsel for the appellant has next submitted that the notification under Section 28(1) was published on 10.12.2001 and the notification under Section 28(4) was published on 23.10.2003 and thus there was a delay of more than 1 year and 10 months in publication of the second notification. As already discussed, the  Page 9 of 10 Scheme of the present Act is different and there is no similar provision like the one contained in proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act which lays down a period of limitation of one year for making a declaration under Section 6(1) of the Act. In absence of any specific provision to that effect in the Act, and the time gap being not very long, it is not possible to hold that the notification under Section 28(4) of the Act is invalid. 14. Shri Shanti Bhushan, learned senior counsel for the appellants, has also submitted that Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. (respondent no.9) were themselves owners of nearly 90 acres of land as three members of a family who were promoters and directors of the company had purchased agricultural land in the year 1995-96. They being not agriculturists, proceedings under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act were initiated against them, whereunder the land would have been forfeited to the State Government without payment of any compensation. In order to save their land, they manipulated with the Government and got their own land acquired whereunder they would be entitled to compensation. It is thus submitted that the whole proceedings for acquisition of the land whereunder not only the land of promoters and directors of Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. but also the land of the appellants, who are agriculturists, was acquired is clearly mala fide. This point has been considered in detail by the High Court and has been repelled. Initially, proceedings initiated under Sections 79A, 79B and 80 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 against Devi Das Garg, one of the promoters of the company were dropped by the order of the Assistant Commissioner dated 23.5.2001. The Assistant Commissioner passed an order of forfeiture of the land against Santosh Kumar Garg on 29.12.2002 and a similar order was passed against Devi Das Garg on 31.12.2003. It may be noted that the order for forfeiture of the land was passed much after the preliminary notification under Section 28(1) of the Act had been issued on 10.12.2001. That apart, the appellants herein are interested in saving their own land from acquisition and have no concern with the land belonging to promoters of Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. They have not laid any foundation in the writ petition to show that the action of the State Government in acquiring their land was a mala fide one. Even assuming that the promoters of Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. somehow succeeded in getting their own land acquired in order to save it from being forfeited by the State Government in view of the provisions of Karnataka Land Reforms Act, that by itself cannot be a ground to strike down the impugned notifications insofar as the land of the appellants is concerned. Shri Nageshwara Rao, learned senior counse for KIADB has also submitted that the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board has only executed a lease deed in favour of Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. for a period of 11 years for a consideration of Rs.25,71,50,781/- and the lessee has to pay a rent of Rs.1,000/- per annum from the date of taking over possession of the land. The lease has been granted on stringent conditions and under clause 10(d) the lessor has the right to terminate the lease and resume the possession of the scheduled property in the event the lessee fails to implement the project within the stipulated period or extended period, if any. Clause 14 contains a condition that the lessor shall be entitled to determine the lease and resume possession of the land if and when there is breach of any of the covenants and obligations contained in the lease deed. The fact that the lease deed has been executed only for a limited period of 11 years clearly shows that the land after acquisition has not been reverted back to Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. conferring proprietary rights on them but they are merely lessees and the ownership and title thereof still vests with the Board. In such circumstances it is not possible to accept the plea of mala fide raised on behalf of the appellants. 15. It is lastly submitted that the State Government had acted in a   10 discriminatory manner in de-notifying some of the lands which had been earlier included in the preliminary notification under Section 28(1) of the Act and whosoever was in a position to approach the concerned authority of the State Government, his land was exempted from acquisition. It has been urged that survey no.9/4 which was earlier included in the notification under Section 28(1) of the Act was specifically de-notified. We are afraid that this plea cannot be examined by us for want of sufficient details. The acquisition of the appellants’ land cannot be struck down on the ground that some of the land which was initially included in the notifications issued under Section 28 of the Act was de-notified. 16. For the reasons discussed above, there is no merit in these appeals, which are hereby dismissed. No order as to costs.","J U D G M E N T (Arising out of Special Leave Petition (C) Nos.9394-9403 of 2004) With C.A. Nos. 3542,3541 and 3543 of 2006 (@ SLP (C) Nos.22798-22800/04, 22869/04 and 6072/05) G.P. MATHUR, J. Leave granted. 2. These appeals, by special leave, have been filed challenging the judgment and order dated 6.4.2004 of a Division Bench of Karnataka High Court by which writ appeals filed by the appellants were dismissed and the judgment and order dated 28.1.2004 of the learned Single Judge dismissing the writ petitions was affirmed. The subject matter of challenge in the writ petitions were two notifications issued under Section 28(1) and 28(4) of Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as ’the Act’). 3. The impugned notifications were issued for acquisition of land for establishment and development of industries by the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board. Before adverting to the contention raised by the learned counsel for the parties, it will be convenient to reproduce the impugned notifications. The first notification bears No.CI:289:SPQ:2001 and was issued on 10.12.2001, relevant part whereof, is reproduced below : ""INDUSTRIES AND COMMERCE SECRETARIAT NOTIFICATION NO:CI:289:SPQ:2001, Bangalore, Dated 10th Dec 2001 The below mentioned lands specified are required for the State government for establishment and development of industries by the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board. With an intention of acquiring the lands notification is hereby published according to Section 28(1) (Act No.18 of 1966) of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966. According to Section 25 of the Act ......................... ................................................... (Omitted as not relevant) From the date of publication of this notification ..... ................................................... (Omitted as not relevant) The map of the lands comprised therein is kept in the office of the Special Land Acquisition Officer, KIADB."" The second notification under Section 28(4) of the Act bears No.CPMG/KA/BG-GPO/13/2003-05 and was issued on 23.10.2003. The relevant part of the notification is being reproduced below : Notification under Section 28(4) Where as it appears, to the State Government that the Lands are to be acquired specified in the schedule here to   of 10 likely to be needed for the purpose stated in the notification No. CI-289 SPQ 2001 dated 10.12.2001 published in Karnataka Gazette part 3-1 page 4 to 11 in exercise of powers conferred according to section 28(1) of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (Karnataka Act No. 18 of 1966). The State Government is satisfied that Lands specified in the schedule of Notification be acquired for the purpose specified as such orders are passed according to section (3). In exercise of the powers conferred according to section 28(4) (Act No. 18 of 1966) of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966 the Karnataka Government is acquiring said Lands below for the purpose specified in the notification as such a declaration is made."" By the notification under Section 28(1) of the Act 110.30 acres of land was proposed to be acquired but by the notification under Section 28(4) of the Act, the acquisition was restricted to an extent of 106 acres 12.3/4 guntas of land. Some of the land owners had challenged the preliminary notification by filing writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Karnataka High Court after orders had been passed under Section 28(3)of the Act. The writ petitions were allowed and the orders passed under Section 28(3) of the Act were quashed giving liberty to proceed with the acquisition from the stage of preliminary notification. Thereafter, the Land Acquisition Officer, after giving an opportunity of hearing to the landowners on the objections filed by them, passed a detailed order and then the notification under Section 28(4) of the Act was issued. 4. Shri Shanti Bhushan, learned senior counsel for the appellants, has challenged the impugned notifications on several grounds and the principal ground is that the land has been acquired in order to benefit a company, namely, Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. (respondent no.9) who had submitted a project report for setting up a software technology park which included an I.T. Training Institute/Engineering College, Research and Development Centre, Educational Centre, Commercial and Residential Buildings and Service Apartments, Convention Centre, Hotel, Shopping Mall, etc. In the notification under Section 28(1) of the Act, the purpose of acquisition, namely, the purpose for which the company, Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. wanted the land, as enumerated above, was not mentioned and, therefore, the appellant landowners were kept in dark and did not get an adequate opportunity to make an effective objection against the proposed acquisition. Learned counsel has submitted that the notification being absolutely vague and cryptic, it deprived the landowners of a valuable right of making an effective representation and in these circumstances the entire acquisition proceedings are illegal and the impugned notifications are liable to be struck down. 5. Shri L. Nageshwara Rao, learned senior counsel for Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (respondent no.2) (hereinafter referred to as ’KIADB’), has submitted that the land was actually acquired by the State Government for industrial development and after acquisition of the land, the same vests with the KIADB which has the authority to give the same on leasehold basis or outright sale to entrepreneurs or companies for the purpose of industrial development and the basic object of acquisition is to promote the establishment and orderly development of industries in that area. Learned counsel has further submitted that the impugned notification did not suffer from any vagueness and clearly indicated the purpose for which the land was sought to be acquired and there is no illegality in the same. He has also urged that the mere fact that a substantial area of the land was subsequently given on lease to a company, Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd., it was not at all obligatory to specifically mention the details of the project which the said company wanted to establish. Learned counsel for the State of Karnataka and also Shri A.  Page 3 of 10 Sundaram, learned senior counsel for Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. (respondent no.9) supported the stand taken by learned counsel for KIADB and submitted that the impugned notifications fully satisfied the requirements of the Act and the Act did not contemplate that at the time of acquisition of the land, the details of the project which was to be set up by the lessees or the subsequent purchasers from the KIADB should also be mentioned in the notifications. 6. In order to examine the contentions advanced by learned counsel for the parties, it is necessary to notice the provisions of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act. The preamble of the Act reads as under : ""An Act to make special provisions for securing the establishment of industrial areas in the State of Karnataka and generally to promote the establishment and orderly development of industries therein, and for that purpose to establish an Industrial Areas Development Board and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid."" Some of the provisions of the Act, which are relevant for the decision of the issue involved, are as under: ""Section 2 \026 Definitions: - In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, (1) ""amenity"" includes road, supply of water or electricity, street lighting, drainage, sewerage, conservancy, and such other convenience, as the State Government may, by notification specify to be an amenity for the purposes of this Act; (2) ""Board"" means the Industrial Areas Development Board established under this Act; (3) ......................................................................... (4) ........................................................................ (5) ""development"" with its grammatical variations means the carrying out of levelling, digging, building, engineering, quarrying or other operations in, on, over or under land, or the making of any material change in any building or land, and includes re-development; and ""to develop"" shall be construed accordingly; (6) ""industrial area"" means any area declared to be an industrial area by the State Government by notification which is to be developed and where industries are to be accommodated and industrial infrastructural facilities and amenities are to be provided and includes, an industrial estate; (7) ""industrial estate"" means any site selected by the State Government where factories and other buildings are built for use by any industries or class of industries; (7a) ""industrial infrastructural facilities’’ means facilities which contribute to the development of industries established in industrial area such as research and development, communication, transport, Banking, Marketing, Technology parks and Townships for the purpose of establishing trade and tourism centres; and any other facility as the State Government may by notification specify to be an industrial infrastructural facility for the purposes of this Act. Section 3 - Declaration of industrial areas: - (1) The State Government may, by notification, declare any area in the State to be an industrial area for the purposes of this Act. (2) Every such notification shall define the limits of the area to which it relates. Section 5 - Establishment and incorporation: -  Page 4 of 10 (1) For the purposes of securing the establishment of industrial areas in the State of Karnataka and generally for promoting the rapid and orderly establishment and development of industries and for providing industrial infrastructual facilities and amenity in industrial areas in the State of Karnataka, there shall be established by the State Government by notification a Board by the name of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board. (2) The said Board shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal, and may sue and be sued in its corporate name, and shall subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder be competent to acquire, hold and dispose of property, both movable and immovable, and to contract and do all things necessary for the purposes of this Act. Section 14 - General powers of the Board: - Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Board shall have power: (a) to acquire and hold such property, both movable and immovable as the Board may deem necessary for the performance of any of its activities and to lease, sell, exchange or otherwise transfer any property held by it on such conditions as may be deemed proper by the Board; (b) ........................................................................ (c) to provide or cause to be provided amenities, industrial infrastructural facilities and common facilities in industrial areas and construct and maintain or cause to be maintained works and buildings therefor; Section 28 - Acquisition of land: - (1) If at any time, in the opinion of the State Government, any land is required for the purpose of development by the Board, or for any other purpose in furtherance of the objects of this Act, the State Government may by notification, give notice of its intention to acquire such land. (2) On publication of a notification under sub-section (1), the State Government shall serve notice upon the owner or where the owner is not the occupier, on the occupier of the land and on all such persons known or believed to be interested therein to show cause, within thirty days from the date of service of the notice, why the land should not be acquired. (3) After considering the cause, if any, shown by the owner of the land and by any other person interested therein, and after giving such owner and person an opportunity of being heard, the State Government may pass such orders as it deems fit. (4) After orders are passed under sub-section (3), where the State Government is satisfied that any land should be acquired for the purpose specified in the notification issued under sub-section (1), a declaration shall, by notification in the official Gazette, be made to that effect. (5) On the publication in the official Gazette of the declaration under sub-section (4), the land shall vest absolutely in the State Government free from all encumbrances. (6) ......................................................................... (7) ......................................................................... (8) Where the land has been acquired for the Board, the State Government, after it has taken possession of the land, may transfer the land to the Board for the purpose for which the land has been acquired.""  Page 5 of 10 Section 29 provides that where the land is acquired by the State Government under Chapter VII (Sections 27 to 31), the compensation for acquisition shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Section 30 provides that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act shall mutatis mutandis apply in respect of the enquiry and award by the Deputy Commissioner, the reference to Court, the apportionment of compensation and payment of compensation in respect of lands acquired under this Chapter. It is important to note that the Land Acquisition Act is not applicable at the stage of acquisition of the land but becomes applicable only in the matter of payment of compensation on account of Section 30 of the Act. Therefore, the provisions of Sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act have no application here and acquisition of land has to be done in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 7. The Preamble of the Act shows that it has been enacted to make special provisions for securing the establishment of industrial areas and generally to promote the establishment and the orderly development of the industries in such industrial areas. Section 2(7a) defines industrial infrastructural facilities. This provision was inserted on 19.2.1997 by an amendment made by Act No.11 of 1997. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the amending Act has some relevance and the same is being reproduced below : ""After the liberalization of economic and industrial policies in the year 1991 increased emphasis has been given for Private Sector Investment not only in the Industrial Sector but also in the Infrastructural Sectors. As such a number of proposals, both from indigenous and foreign companies have been received for considerable investments in infrastructural areas like establishment of power projects, express highways, ports, airports, townships, industrial parks etc. These projects need considerable extent of land for implementation. Therefore, it is considered necessary to amend the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966, to enable the Board to acquire land for providing Industrial Infrastructural Facilities."" As the definition shows, anything which contributes to the development of industries in industrial areas like technology parks, townships for the purpose of establishing trade and tourism centres and any other facility as the State Government may notify, will be an industrial infrastructural facility. It, therefore, shows that the object of the Act is not only to secure establishment of industrial areas and orderly development of industries therein, but also to create facilities which contribute to the development of industries which may include technology parks, townships, trade and tourism centres, etc. 9. The provision for acquisition of land under the Act is contained in Section 28 which is somewhat different from the provisions contained in Sections 4, 5A and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act. The legislature in its wisdom thought it proper to make a specific provision for acquisition of the land in the Act itself rather than to take recourse to Sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act. A plain reading of sub-section (1) of Section 28 would show that land can be acquired for the purpose of (i) development by the Board, or (ii) for any other purpose in furtherance of the objects of the Act. Sub-section (3) of Section 28 is similar to Section 5A of the Land Acquisition Act and the final notification is issued under sub-section (4) of Section 28. The necessary precondition for a valid notification under sub-section (4) of Section 28 is that the State Government should be satisfied that the land is required for the purpose specified in the notification issued under sub-section (1), viz., for the purpose of (i) development by the Board, or (ii) for any other purpose in furtherance of the objects of the Act. Therefore, in order to judge the validity of the notification what is to be seen is whether the  Page 6 of 10 acquisition of land is being made for securing the establishment of industrial areas or to promote the establishment or orderly development of industries in such areas. In view of wide definition of the words ""industrial infrastructural facilities"" as contained in Section 2 (7a) of the Act, making of a technology park, research and development centre, townships, trade and tourism centres or making provisions for marketing and banking which would contribute to the development of industries will meet the objectives of the Act and acquisition of land for such a purpose would be perfectly valid. 10. Shri Shanti Bhushan, learned senior counsel for the appellants, has strongly urged that as the impugned notification under Section 28(1) of the Act did not mention that the land was sought to be acquired for a technology park, research and development centre, shopping mall, engineering college, residential apartments, etc., the landowners could not make a proper and effective representation under Section 28(2) of the Act which deprived them of a valuable right given to them under the Act of showing cause against the proposed acquisition and consequently the notification is bad. Learned counsel has also submitted that the notification is very vague and cryptic. We are unable to accept the contention raised. Sub section (1) of Section 28 clearly shows that the land can be acquired for (i) development by the Board; or (ii) for any other purpose in furtherance of the objects of the Act. Under sub-section (8) of Section 28, the State Government is empowered, after it has taken possession of land, to transfer the same to the Board for the purpose for which the land has been acquired. Section 32 empowers the State Government to place at the disposal of the Board any land vested in it and the Board is enjoined to deal with the land in accordance with the regulations made and directions given by the State Government in this behalf. This stage when the Board gets the authority to deal with the land comes at a later stage which is after the land has been developed by it. An entrepreneur or a company may give a proposal to the State Government for setting up an industry or infrastructural facility and the Government may thereafter acquire the land and give it to the Board. It is also possible that after the land has already been acquired and developed by the Board, it may be allotted to an entrepreneur or a company for setting up an industry or infrastructural facility. Therefore, the scheme of the Act does not show that at the time of acquisition of the land and issuing a preliminary notification under Section 28(1) of the Act, the complete details of the nature of the industry or infrastructural facility proposed to be set up should also be mentioned. At that stage what is to be seen is whether the land is acquired for development by the Board or for any other purpose in furtherance of the objects of the Act, as mentioned in sub-section (1) of Section 28 of the Act. In fact, if the contention raised by the learned senior counsel for the appellants is accepted, it would mean that even at the stage of preliminary notification under Section 28(1) of the Act, the nature of the activity which may be done by some entrepreneur or a company which may give a proposal for setting up an industry or infrastructural facility much after land has been acquired should also be taken note of and specifically mentioned in the notification, which is well nigh impossible. While interpreting the provisions of the Act, the Court should not only take into consideration the facts of the present case but should also have in mind all possible contingencies. Therefore, on a plain reading of the language used in the Act, it is not possible to accept the contention of the learned senior counsel for the appellants that the impugned notification is vague or cryptic as the complete details of the project which was proposed to be established by Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. (respondent no.9) were not mentioned and on account of the aforesaid lacuna, the landowners were deprived of their right to make a proper representation or to show cause against the proposed acquisition. 11. Learned senior counsel for the appellant has placed strong  Page 7 of 10 reliance on a Three Judge Bench decision of this Court in Munshi Singh & Ors. v. Union of India (1973) 2 SCC 337 in support of his submission that the impugned notifications are vague and are, therefore, liable to be struck down. In this case a notification was issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act by the State Government on 16.7.1960 declaring its intention to acquire 34,000 acres of land in 50 villages of Ghaziabad. By a subsequent notification dated 9.2.1962, the proposed area was reduced from 34,000 acres to 6,158 acres. The appellants Munshi Singh and others made an application on 4.7.1962 to the Special Land Acquisition Officer for supplying a copy of the Scheme of the planned development to enable them to make an effective representation at the time of hearing of the objections under Section 5A of the Land Acquisition Act, but the same was rejected by an order which mentioned that ""the scheme of the planned development is not necessary for a notification under Section 4 of the Act, as such, no such scheme of the planned development is available in this office."" The Master Plan was sanctioned subsequently on 4.9.1962. The notification was challenged on the ground that the words in the notification, viz. ""for planned development of the area"", gave no indication whatsoever as to the purpose for which the land was acquired and the same was vague. It was held that there was no indication whatsoever in the notification whether the development was to be of residential area and building cities or of commercial and industrial plots nor was it possible for anyone to find out what kind of planned development was under contemplation i.e. whether the land was to be developed by the Government or whether the owners of the properties would be required to develop a particular area in a specified way. It was also held that if the Master Plan which came to be sanctioned on 4.9.1962 had been available for inspection by the persons interested or even if the knowledge of its existence on the part of the appellants had been satisfactorily proved, the position may have been different, as in that situation the landowners could not claim that they were unable to file objections owing to the lack of any indication in the notification under Section 4 of the nature of the development for which the area was being acquired. In our opinion, the authority cited is clearly distinguishable on facts. The Scheme of the planned development was not available when the notification was issued and in fact the Master Plan itself was sanctioned much after the publication of the notification and in these circumstances the words ""planned development of the area"" were clearly vague. Such is not the case here as the impugned notification clearly mentions that the land is sought to be acquired for establishment and development of industries by KIADB. The second case relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants is M.P. Housing Board v. Mohd. Shafi & Ors. (1992) 2 SCC 168. In this case, a notification was issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act to acquire 2.298 hectares of land in city/village Mandsaur, Tehsil and Distt. Mandsaur and in the column for purpose only ""residential"" was mentioned. The notification was struck down on the ground that no khasra number, locality or any other particulars of the land sought to be acquired was mentioned when Mandsaur city was spread over a large area of 25 sq. kilometers. It was also held that the word ""residential"" was hopelessly vague as it conveyed no idea about the purpose of acquisition. In our opinion, this case can be of no assistance to the appellants for the obvious reason that the no details or particular of the land like khasra number and locality had been mentioned and the word ""residential"" by itself did not show that the acquisition was being made for a public purpose, which is essential for a valid notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act. The next decision relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the appellants is State of Tamil Nadu & Ors. v. L. Krishnan & Ors. (1996) 1 SCC 250. In this case, after referring to some earlier decisions including that of Munshi Singh (supra), it was held that whether the public purpose stated in a particular notification is vague or not, is a question of fact  Page 8 of 10 to be decided in each case and cannot be treated as a question of law. 12. Shri Nageshwara Rao, learned senior counsel for KIADB has, on the other hand, relied upon a Constitution Bench decision in Babu Barkya Thakur v. State of Bombay AIR 1960 SC 1203, wherein it was held as under : ""It is not absolutely necessary to the validity of the land acquisition proceedings that the statement that the land to be acquired was needed for a public purpose should find a place in the notification actually issued. The requirements of the law will be satisfied if, in substance, it is found on investigation, and the appropriate Government is satisfied as a result of the investigation that the land was needed for the purpose of a company, which would amount to a public purpose under Part VII."" In Union of India v. Jaswant Rai Kochhar (1996) 3 SCC 491, it was held that when the notification mentioned that the land is sought to be acquired for a housing scheme but actually it is to be used for a district centre, the public purpose does not cease to be a public purpose and the notification could not be quashed on the ground that the land is sought to be used for a commercial purpose. This authority has been cited to show that even a change of purpose (from residential to commercial) would not result in invalidating the notification. Strong reliance has also been placed on Pratibha Nema & Ors. v. State of M.P. & Ors. (2003) 10 SCC 626, where the notification was challenged on the ground that it was vague and reliance was placed on the decisions rendered in M.P. Housing Board (supra) and Munshi Singh (supra) where it was observed that the public purpose ""needs to be particularized"" to satisfy the requirements of law. The Bench held as under in para 38: ""38. When no prejudice has been demonstrated nor could be reasonably inferred, it would be unjust and inappropriate to strike down the notification under Section 4(1) on the basis of a nebulous plea, in exercise of writ jurisdiction under Article 226. Even assuming that there is some ambiguity in particularizing the public purpose and the possibility of doubt cannot be ruled out, the Constitutional Courts in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 or 136 should not, as a matter of course, deal a lethal blow to the entire proceedings based on the theoretical or hypothetical grievance of the petitioner. It would be sound exercise of discretion to intervene when a real and substantial grievance is made out, the non redressal of which would cause prejudice and injustice to the aggrieved party. Vagueness of the public purpose, especially, in a matter like this where it is possible to take two views, is not something which affects the jurisdiction and it would therefore be proper to bear in mind the considerations of prejudice and injustice."" It is necessary to emphasize that all the decisions cited by learned counsel for the parties deal with notifications issued under Land Acquisition Act and as demonstrated earlier, the Scheme of the Act under our consideration is different. Even on the principle laid down in the authorities which were cited by learned counsel for the parties and which have been discussed above, it cannot be held that the impugned notifications are vague or cryptic or that they suffer from any infirmity. The challenge raised to the notifications on the aforesaid grounds must fail. 13. Learned counsel for the appellant has next submitted that the notification under Section 28(1) was published on 10.12.2001 and the notification under Section 28(4) was published on 23.10.2003 and thus there was a delay of more than 1 year and 10 months in publication of the second notification. As already discussed, the  Page 9 of 10 Scheme of the present Act is different and there is no similar provision like the one contained in proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act which lays down a period of limitation of one year for making a declaration under Section 6(1) of the Act. In absence of any specific provision to that effect in the Act, and the time gap being not very long, it is not possible to hold that the notification under Section 28(4) of the Act is invalid. 14. Shri Shanti Bhushan, learned senior counsel for the appellants, has also submitted that Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. (respondent no.9) were themselves owners of nearly 90 acres of land as three members of a family who were promoters and directors of the company had purchased agricultural land in the year 1995-96. They being not agriculturists, proceedings under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act were initiated against them, whereunder the land would have been forfeited to the State Government without payment of any compensation. In order to save their land, they manipulated with the Government and got their own land acquired whereunder they would be entitled to compensation. It is thus submitted that the whole proceedings for acquisition of the land whereunder not only the land of promoters and directors of Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. but also the land of the appellants, who are agriculturists, was acquired is clearly mala fide. This point has been considered in detail by the High Court and has been repelled. Initially, proceedings initiated under Sections 79A, 79B and 80 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 against Devi Das Garg, one of the promoters of the company were dropped by the order of the Assistant Commissioner dated 23.5.2001. The Assistant Commissioner passed an order of forfeiture of the land against Santosh Kumar Garg on 29.12.2002 and a similar order was passed against Devi Das Garg on 31.12.2003. It may be noted that the order for forfeiture of the land was passed much after the preliminary notification under Section 28(1) of the Act had been issued on 10.12.2001. That apart, the appellants herein are interested in saving their own land from acquisition and have no concern with the land belonging to promoters of Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. They have not laid any foundation in the writ petition to show that the action of the State Government in acquiring their land was a mala fide one. Even assuming that the promoters of Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. somehow succeeded in getting their own land acquired in order to save it from being forfeited by the State Government in view of the provisions of Karnataka Land Reforms Act, that by itself cannot be a ground to strike down the impugned notifications insofar as the land of the appellants is concerned. Shri Nageshwara Rao, learned senior counse for KIADB has also submitted that the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board has only executed a lease deed in favour of Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. for a period of 11 years for a consideration of Rs.25,71,50,781/- and the lessee has to pay a rent of Rs.1,000/- per annum from the date of taking over possession of the land. The lease has been granted on stringent conditions and under clause 10(d) the lessor has the right to terminate the lease and resume the possession of the scheduled property in the event the lessee fails to implement the project within the stipulated period or extended period, if any. Clause 14 contains a condition that the lessor shall be entitled to determine the lease and resume possession of the land if and when there is breach of any of the covenants and obligations contained in the lease deed. The fact that the lease deed has been executed only for a limited period of 11 years clearly shows that the land after acquisition has not been reverted back to Vikas Telecom (P) Ltd. conferring proprietary rights on them but they are merely lessees and the ownership and title thereof still vests with the Board. In such circumstances it is not possible to accept the plea of mala fide raised on behalf of the appellants. 15. It is lastly submitted that the State Government had acted in a   10 discriminatory manner in de-notifying some of the lands which had been earlier included in the preliminary notification under Section 28(1) of the Act and whosoever was in a position to approach the concerned authority of the State Government, his land was exempted from acquisition. It has been urged that survey no.9/4 which was earlier included in the notification under Section 28(1) of the Act was specifically de-notified. We are afraid that this plea cannot be examined by us for want of sufficient details. The acquisition of the appellants’ land cannot be struck down on the ground that some of the land which was initially included in the notifications issued under Section 28 of the Act was de-notified. 16. For the reasons discussed above, there is no merit in these appeals, which are hereby dismissed. No order as to costs."
18,Appeal (civil) 1682 of 1999,Hansa Industries Pvt. Ltd. and others,Kidarsons Industries Pvt. Ltd,13/10/2006,B.P. SINGH & ALTAMAS KABIR,"J U D G M E N T B.P. SINGH, J. This appeal by Special Leave is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi dated March 25, 1998 in F.A.O (O.S.) No.39 of 1993, whereby the Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellants herein against the order of the learned Single Judge dismissing their objections to the report of the Chartered Accountants who had valued the share of Respondent No.1 \026 Company, and directing the implementation of the settlement arrived at between the parties on 9th June, 1988. This Court while granting special leave by its Order dated March 19, 1999 restricted the appeal to two issues only as recorded in the order of this Court dated August 10, 1998, namely issues relating: ""(a) The portion of the Golf Links property which was in the possession of N.N. Nanda. (b) Modification of the Division Bench order so that it is stated that the company shall challenge the imposition of capital gains tax, if any provided funds for that purpose are furnished by the appellants"". To appreciate the background in which the two aforesaid issues arise, it is necessary to refer to the factual background of the case. The relevant facts are really not in dispute. The Respondent No.1 \026 Company, namely \026 Kidarsons Industries Pvt. Ltd. is a Private Limited Company closely held by the Nanda family. Except for a few shares held by their relatives and friends the entire shareholding of the Company is that of the members of the Nanda family. Appellant No.2 before us is Shri Narendra Nath Nanda. His three brothers namely, Mohinder Nath, Varinder Nath and Rajinder Nath were the respondents in the High Court alongwith their mother, who is no more. The main source of income of Respondent No.1 \026 Company was the commission earned from the agency business of M/s. Thyssen Sthal Union of Germany (hereinafter referred to as ’Thyssen’). Disputes arose between the brothers, and it appears that appellant No.2 succeeded in getting the agency exclusively in his name. M/s. Thyssen served a notice on Respondent No.1 \026 Company terminating their agency w.e.f. June   of 9 30, 1988 and thereafter the agency was given to appellant No.1, namely Hansa Industries Private Limited, a company controlled by appellant No.2. After the termination of the agency of Respondent No.1 \026 Company, the appellants herein filed a petition for winding up of Respondent No.1 \026 Company alleging that the agency having been terminated, the main source of income of the Company had vanished and, therefore, it was just and equitable to wind up the Company. On the other hand, the Respondents filed a suit for declaration and for injunction restraining the appellants from carrying on the agency business by holding themselves out as the agent of M/s. Thyssen. During the pendency of the proceedings the parties arrived at a compromise whereby appellant No.2 Narendra Nath Nanda and his group agreed to transfer their equity shares in Kidarsons Industries (P) Ltd. Respondent No.1 \026 Company, constituting 30.14% of the share capital of Respondent No.1 \026 Company, in favour of the respondents. The price of the shares was to be paid in specie by transferring to the appellants 30.14% of the assets of the Company. The agency of Thyssen was to be retained by Narendra Nath Nanda, appellant No.2 and his group. The relevant terms of the settlement are the following: ""2. That the price of the aforesaid 5654 (later corrected as 5564) equity shares of Kidarsons Industries (P) Ltd., will be paid to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda, and/or his nominees in specie by Company by transferring to him 30.14% of the assets of the Company. Marginal amount not exceeding 5 lakhs may be paid by the company to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda and/or his nominees as the case may be, in cash if found necessary. Similarly Shri Narendra Nath Nanda may make similar compensatory equilisation payment to the company. Parties by consent can, however, agree to a larger amount. 6. That Shri P.N Khanna, Retired Judge is at present acting as a Mediator. He will act as a Commissioner, to separate 30.14% of the assets of the company to be given to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda Group as set out hereinbefore. 10. Assets of the company will be valued as on 01.07.1988. 14. Shri Narendra Nath Nanda will continue to occupy the portion of the property of the company in which he is at present residing as deemed owner/owner, and the value of such portion will be taken into account for evaluating the assets of the company. The value of such part of the property as is occupied by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda will be adjusted in the value of his share. 16. That for the purpose of valuation of share of Shri Narendra Nath Nanda Group, the property No.K-72, Udyog Nagar, Rohtak Road, Delhi will be treated as the property  Page 3 of 9 of the company. 19. This agreement will be filed in the Suit No.1310 of 1988 and C.P. No.28 of 1988, and appropriate orders will be passed in the suit"". Justice P.N. Khanna acting as the Commissioner allotted the Golf Links property to the group of appellant No.2 even though he found that appellant No.2 and his group were entitled to get assets worth Rs.1.10 crores whereas the value of the property was Rs.1.82 crores. However, since further disputes arose between the parties the matter came up before the Court and it was agreed by the parties that the valuation of the shares of Respondent No.1 \026 Company namely, Kidarsons Industries Private Ltd. and the immovable properties owned by the Company shall be done, and for this purpose the Court by its order of August 30, 1990 appointed M/s. V. Shankar Aiyer and Company as the Chartered Accountants for valuing the assets of the Respondent No.1 \026 Company. They were required to work out the value of each share after valuing the assets as well as the liabilities of the Company. The Court passed an order to this effect on September 4, 1990. The Chartered Accountants gave their report and worked out the net assets of Respondent No.1 \026 Company at Rs.1,68,95,570/-. On that basis the value of each share was worked out as Rs.916/-. From this the valuers deducted 20% on account of provision restricting transfer of the shares of Respondent No.1 \026 Company. By this process, the value of each share was worked out to be Rs.733/-. Appellant No.2 filed his objections to the report of the Chartered Accountants which was dismissed by a learned Judge of the High Court by his Judgment and order dated February 5, 1993. Objections were raised such as those relating to valuation of goodwill, valuation of tenancy rights, valuation of Udyog Nagar plot, deduction from the value of the assets, provision for capital gains tax liability which may be payable on the hypothetical transfer of property, the deductions made from the value of the shares on account of restriction on transfer of the shares, and the question of allotment of a portion of the Golf Links property in favour of appellant No.2 Shri Narendra Nath Nanda in terms of Clause 14 of the settlement between the parties. In the instant appeal, we are only concerned with two issues namely, whether the portion of Golf Links property which at the time of settlement was occupied by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda be not allotted to him, and secondly, whether appropriate directions be given so that the appellants be made liable for payment of capital gains tax, if any, levied in future which levy shall be challenged by Respondent No.1 \026 Company, provided the funds are made available to it by the appellants for the purpose. At the threshold we may observe that the exercise undertaken by the High Court was with a view to give effect to the terms of settlement reached between the parties. It is trite that the terms of settlement reached between the parties shall ordinarily not be modified except with the consent of the parties. In the instant case, it has not been argued by anyone that the terms of settlement with which we are concerned are either illegal as being opposed to any statute or that it is hit by impossibility of performance and, therefore cannot be performed or that the settlement was not reached bona fide. Learned counsel appearing  Page 4 of 9 on behalf of the appellants submitted that Clause 14 of the settlement in clear terms provided that appellant No.2 was to continue to occupy the portion of the Golf Links property of the Company in which he was residing as deemed owner/owner, and that the value of such portion shall be taken into account for evaluating the assets of the Company. The value of such part of the property as was occupied by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda was to be adjusted in the value of his share. He submitted that the parties clearly agreed that Shri Narendra Nath Nanda, appellant No.2 will be allotted the portion of Golf Links property occupied by him on the date of settlement and that the value of the portion occupied by him shall be adjusted against the value of his share. It was submitted before us that in case anything more has to be paid that will be paid by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda, but the Respondents cannot insist on the ground of their convenience that the entire Golf Links property be allotted to them. The High Court in its impugned judgment has observed that having regard to the acrimony between the parties it was practically impossible for them to live in the same house. The strained relationship between the parties was evident from the fact that there had been instances of violence, and matters reached such a stage that reports were made to the police. The High Court also observed that being leasehold property, sub-division of the property was not permitted. It further observed that under the settlement, the appellants were entitled to 30.14% of the assets of the Company and only a sum not exceeding 5 lakhs could have been paid by the Company in cash, if the same was found necessary, and vice versa. Having regard to these circumstances the learned Judges held that the interpretation placed on Clause 14 by the learned Single Judge was correct and the said property could not in any manner be given to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda. We may observe that before us counsel appearing on behalf of Shri Narendra Nath Nanda gave up his claim of allotment of the entire Golf Links property to him and submitted that he will be satisfied if the portion in his occupation on the date of settlement is allotted to him. He has very strongly asserted that when a settlement had been reached which is sought to be given effect, the Court cannot re-write the settlement. There is no ambiguity in Clause 14 of the settlement, and there is nothing to indicate that it is unworkable, however inconvenient it may be to the respondent. Certainly, it was not incapable of being implemented and the architects may have a solution for their problem. It is submitted that if, however, the Court comes to the conclusion that Clause 14 cannot be given effect, it being one of the important conditions of the settlement, the whole agreement becomes un-enforceable with its concomitant consequences. It is, therefore, submitted that in terms of Clause 14 of the settlement the portion of the Golf Links property which was in occupation of Shri Narendra Nath Nanda ought to be demarcated and allotted to him and the value thereof be adjusted against his share. It is submitted that in the ultimate analysis the parties will themselves have to find a solution to their problems, if any, and learn to live peacefully in the premises. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent submitted that this was really a case of family settlement and the learned Judges have taken the broadest view of the matter with a view to give effect to the settlement reached between the parties. It is submitted that the over- all intention was to give respondent No.1 \026 Company to the contesting respondents and by compensating the appellants who are entitled to their 30.14% share in specie and the agency business of Thyssen. If the dominating intention of the parties has been effected minor issues like the one raised by the appellants should not defeat the settlement reached between the parties. It is submitted that a  Page 5 of 9 little ironing out of creases in family settlements must be permitted. It is therefore, submitted that the finding of the High Court on this aspect of the matter required no interference. Learned counsel for the respondents has brought to our notice a decision of the this Court in Kale and others vs. Deputy Director of Consolidation and others : (1976) 3 SCC 119 laying down the approach of the Court in giving effect to a bona fide family arrangement entered into between the parties with a view to resolving disputes once for all. This Court held that the family arrangements are governed by special equity peculiar to themselves and would be enforced if honestly made. Reference was made with approval to a passage appearing in Kerr on Fraud wherein the following pertinent observations appear:- ""The principles which apply to the case of ordinary compromise between strangers, do not equally apply to the case of compromises in the nature of family arrangements. Family arrangements are governed by a special equity peculiar to themselves, and will be enforced if honestly made, although they have not been meant as a compromise, but have proceeded from an error of all parties, originating in mistake or ignorance of fact as to what their rights actually are, or of the points on which their rights actually depend."" Reference was also made to the observations regarding the essentials of the family settlement and the principles governing the existence of the same in Halsbury’s Laws of England, Volume 17, Third Edition at pp. 215-216 which are as follows : "" A family arrangement is an agreement between members of the same family, intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of the family either by compromising doubtful or disputed rights or by preserving the family property or the peace and security of the family by avoiding litigation or by saving its honour. The agreement may be implied from a long course of dealing, but it is more usual to embody or to effectuate the agreement in a deed to which the term ""family arrangement"" is applied. Family arrangements are governed by principles which are not applicable to dealings between strangers. The Court, when deciding the rights of parties under family arrangements or claims to upset such arrangements, considers what in the broadest view of the matter is most for the interest of families, and has regard to considerations which, in dealing with transactions between persons not members of the same family, would not be taken into account. Matters which would be fatal to the validity of similar transactions between strangers are not objections to the binding effect of family arrangements."" This Court held that courts have leaned in favour of upholding a family arrangement instead of disturbing the same on technical or trivial grounds. Where the courts find that the family arrangement suffers from a legal lacuna or a formal defect the rule of estoppel is pressed into service and is applied to shut out plea of the person who being a party to family arrangement seeks to unsettle a settled dispute and claims to revoke the family arrangement under which he has himself enjoyed some material benefits. The principles were concretized and succinctly reduced to the following propositions :  Page 6 of 9 ""(1) The family settlement must be a bona fide one so as to resolve family disputes and rival claims by a fair and equitable division or allotment of properties between the various members of the family; (2) The said settlement must be voluntary and should not be induced by fraud, coercion or undue influence; (3) The family arrangement may be even oral in which case no registration is necessary; (4) It is well settled that registration would be necessary only if the terms of the family arrangement are reduced into writing. Here also, a distinction should be made between a document containing the terms and recitals of a family arrangement made under the document and a mere memorandum prepared after the family arrangement had already been made either for the purpose of the record or for information of the Court for making necessary mutation. In such a case the memorandum itself does not create or extinguish any rights in immoveable properties and therefore does not fall within the mischief of Section 17(2) (sic) (Section 17(1)(b)?) of the Registration Act and is, therefore, not compulsorily registrable; (5) The members who may be parties to the family arrangement must have some antecedent title, claim or interest even a possible claim in the property which is acknowledged by the parties to the settlement. Even if one of the parties to the settlement has no title but under the arrangement the other party relinquishes all its claims or titles in favour of such a person and acknowledges him to be the sole owner, then the antecedent title must be assumed and the family arrangement will be upheld, and the Courts will find no difficulty in giving assent to the same; (6) Even if bona fide disputes, present or possible, which may not involve legal claims are settled by a bona fide family arrangement which is fair and equitable the family arrangement is final and binding on the parties to the settlement."" The aforesaid judgment of this Court refers to many other decisions to which we need not advert in this case but some of those decisions do take the view that a compromise or family arrangement is based on the assumption that there is an antecedent title of some sort in the parties and the agreement acknowledges and defines what that title is, each party relinquishing all claims to property other than that falling to his share and recognising the right of the others, as they had previously asserted it, to the portions allotted to them respectively. That explains why no conveyance is required in these cases to pass the title from the one in whom it resides to the person receiving it under the family arrangement. It is assumed that the title claimed by the person receiving the property under the arrangement had always resided in him or her so far as the property falling to his or her share is concerned and therefore no conveyance is necessary. We have made the above observations only because it has some relevance to the second issue which arises for our consideration in this appeal. It is true that the High Court has taken note of the practicalities of the situation and has proceeded on the basis that the appellants and the respondents cannot peacefully live in the same premises. The High Court has, therefore, not favoured allotment of a portion of the house in favour of appellant No.2 and has approved the allotment of the house to the respondents  Page 7 of 9 who owned the majority shares in the respondent No.1 \026 Company. This was done with a view to ensure that the parties live separately but in peace and harmony. We cannot find fault with the concern shown by the High Court, but the problem which arises in the instant case is that the High Court was not considering a matter in which it could have exercised its discretion to make allotment one way or the other as in a case of family partition. The decree of the Court is based upon a settlement reached between the parties. Even at the time when the settlement was reached the parties were well aware of the strained relationship which existed and the unfortunate events that occurred between the branch of appellant No.2 and the remaining members of the family. Despite this, it was agreed by all of them that the portion in occupation of appellant No.2 shall be allotted to him and the value thereof adjusted against his share. The respondents cannot now be heard to say that it would be inconvenient for them to reside with appellant No.2 and his family members in the same house, though in separate portions. The question as to how the parties will manage their affairs is a matter with which they only are primarily concerned and the Court cannot advise them in the matter. It may be that the architects may provide a solution for their problems, or it may be that in view of the circumstances one party may agree to sell its share or buy the share of the other party with a view to purchase peace, if that becomes necessary. These are matters in which the Court may have nothing to say. Clause 14 of the settlement being unambiguous, clear and categoric, it must be given effect because one cannot term the said Clause 14 as vitiated by fraud, or illegal being in breach of any statutory provision, or against public policy, or hit by the principle of impossibility of performance. The settlement was made bona fide by the parties to resolve all their disputes and all facts were known to the parties when they reached the settlement. With their eyes open and fully aware of their experiences of the past, they agreed to share the Golf Links property. The relevant clause in the settlement is not vitiated by any consideration which may impel the court not to give effect to that clause in the settlement. The question of practical inconvenience should have concerned the respondents when they entered into the settlement. They cannot at the stage of implementation of the settlement avoid a covenant in the settlement solemnly incorporated with their consent on the pretext of practical inconvenience of living in the same house, albeit in separate portions, in the unfortunate background of bickerings and acrimony. This issue must, therefore, be decided in favour of the appellants. The next question is whether the judgment of the High Court could be suitably modified to provide for challenge by respondent -Company to any order that may be passed in future by the tax authority imposing capital gains tax on the hypothetical transfers made under the settlement. We find from the judgment of the High Court that the matter was discussed at length and the Court was of the view, prima facie, that the transfers may attract capital gains tax. There was, therefore, justification for deduction of the anticipated capital gains tax liability from the total value of assets. Before us learned counsel for the respondent did not want to join issue on this question and left it to us to pass an appropriate order. Learned counsel for the appellants argued before us that no capital gains tax is payable in the instant case because the transfers are by virtue of an order of the Court and, therefore, Sections 100 to 104 of the Companies Act are attracted. There is in reality no transfer or sale that may attract capital gains  Page 8 of 9 tax, in view of the pre-existing right and title of the parties which gets crystalised under a family arrangement. He further submitted that so far as respondent - Company is concerned it does not get any consideration and, therefore, there is no question of any capital gains tax liability so far as respondent \026 Company is concerned. In any event even if the capital gains tax liability is imposed that will be the liability of the appellants herein, and they will be obliged to discharge that liability in accordance with law. Learned counsel for the appellant made a clear and categoric statement before us that if any liability arises out of the valuation of the assets or capital gains relating to properties covered by the settlement, the appellants shall be liable to discharge that liability. The appellants are willing to execute an undertaking to this effect and to creating a charge on the assets which may fall to their share for discharge of such tax liability, if any, imposed. It was submitted that there was no need to deduct this amount from the value of the assets of the Company and this Court may direct that in case such a liability arises in future and any demand is raised against respondent \026 Company of capital gains tax, the appellants shall be liable to discharge that liability. Respondent No.1 shall be entitled to challenge the tax demand, if any, for which necessary funds will be made available by the appellants. All this has been stated on the assumption that on a future date there is a demand of capital gains tax by the tax authority on the alleged transfers made under the settlement. We are of the view that since no demand of capital gains tax has been made so far, if any such demand is made in future in respect of the transfer of assets under the settlement for which 20% has been deducted by the Chartered Accountants, the respondent \026 Company shall challenge the demand provided the appellants shall place at its disposal necessary funds for the purpose. In any event the liability under the head ""capital gains"", if any, shall be that of the appellants who shall furnish an undertaking to this effect accepting their liability, and create a charge over the aforesaid assets to secure payment of capital gains tax, if any, imposed in future. Subject to this being done, there shall be no deduction from the value of the assets of the company of the anticipated liability of capital gains. below:- We, therefore, allow this appeal to the extent indicated a) that the judgment and order of the High Court is modified to the extent that appellant No.2, namely \026 Shri Narendra Nath Nanda shall be allotted the portion of the Golf Links house which was in his occupation on the date of settlement, and the value thereof shall be adjusted against his share. If something remains to be paid even after adjustment, the appellants shall pay such amount within a period of two months from the date of the order of the High Court. b) That no deduction shall be made from the value of the assets of the anticipated capital gains tax liability on the hypothetical sale under the settlement. In case a demand of capital gains tax is made by the tax authority in future against respondent \026 Company, the aforesaid Company shall be entitled to challenge the imposition of such tax subject to appellant No.2 providing sufficient funds to the respondent \026 Company for this purpose. In any event, the capital gains tax, if found payable, shall be the liability of the appellants to be discharged by them. They shall  Page 9 of 9 furnish an undertaking before the High Court accepting such liability, and shall execute a document creating a charge on the assets allocated to them under the settlement to discharge capital gains tax liability, if found payable. The matter is remitted to the High Court for giving effect to the aforesaid modifications which may involve directing the Chartered Accountants to make a re-calculation on the basis of the directions contained in this judgment, and apportion the assets accordingly. This appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above. Parties to bear their own costs. WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO.1705 OF 1999 Hansa Industries Pvt. Ltd. and others \005Appellants Versus Kidarsons Industries Pvt. Ltd. \005Respondent J U D G M E N T B.P. SINGH, J. In view of the judgment passed by us today in Civil Appeal No. 1682 of 1999 it is not necessary to pass any order in this appeal. The appeal stands disposed of.","J U D G M E N T B.P. SINGH, J. This appeal by Special Leave is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi dated March 25, 1998 in F.A.O (O.S.) No.39 of 1993, whereby the Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellants herein against the order of the learned Single Judge dismissing their objections to the report of the Chartered Accountants who had valued the share of Respondent No.1 \026 Company, and directing the implementation of the settlement arrived at between the parties on 9th June, 1988. This Court while granting special leave by its Order dated March 19, 1999 restricted the appeal to two issues only as recorded in the order of this Court dated August 10, 1998, namely issues relating: ""(a) The portion of the Golf Links property which was in the possession of N.N. Nanda. (b) Modification of the Division Bench order so that it is stated that the company shall challenge the imposition of capital gains tax, if any provided funds for that purpose are furnished by the appellants"". To appreciate the background in which the two aforesaid issues arise, it is necessary to refer to the factual background of the case. The relevant facts are really not in dispute. The Respondent No.1 \026 Company, namely \026 Kidarsons Industries Pvt. Ltd. is a Private Limited Company closely held by the Nanda family. Except for a few shares held by their relatives and friends the entire shareholding of the Company is that of the members of the Nanda family. Appellant No.2 before us is Shri Narendra Nath Nanda. His three brothers namely, Mohinder Nath, Varinder Nath and Rajinder Nath were the respondents in the High Court alongwith their mother, who is no more. The main source of income of Respondent No.1 \026 Company was the commission earned from the agency business of M/s. Thyssen Sthal Union of Germany (hereinafter referred to as ’Thyssen’). Disputes arose between the brothers, and it appears that appellant No.2 succeeded in getting the agency exclusively in his name. M/s. Thyssen served a notice on Respondent No.1 \026 Company terminating their agency w.e.f. June   of 9 30, 1988 and thereafter the agency was given to appellant No.1, namely Hansa Industries Private Limited, a company controlled by appellant No.2. After the termination of the agency of Respondent No.1 \026 Company, the appellants herein filed a petition for winding up of Respondent No.1 \026 Company alleging that the agency having been terminated, the main source of income of the Company had vanished and, therefore, it was just and equitable to wind up the Company. On the other hand, the Respondents filed a suit for declaration and for injunction restraining the appellants from carrying on the agency business by holding themselves out as the agent of M/s. Thyssen. During the pendency of the proceedings the parties arrived at a compromise whereby appellant No.2 Narendra Nath Nanda and his group agreed to transfer their equity shares in Kidarsons Industries (P) Ltd. Respondent No.1 \026 Company, constituting 30.14% of the share capital of Respondent No.1 \026 Company, in favour of the respondents. The price of the shares was to be paid in specie by transferring to the appellants 30.14% of the assets of the Company. The agency of Thyssen was to be retained by Narendra Nath Nanda, appellant No.2 and his group. The relevant terms of the settlement are the following: ""2. That the price of the aforesaid 5654 (later corrected as 5564) equity shares of Kidarsons Industries (P) Ltd., will be paid to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda, and/or his nominees in specie by Company by transferring to him 30.14% of the assets of the Company. Marginal amount not exceeding 5 lakhs may be paid by the company to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda and/or his nominees as the case may be, in cash if found necessary. Similarly Shri Narendra Nath Nanda may make similar compensatory equilisation payment to the company. Parties by consent can, however, agree to a larger amount. 6. That Shri P.N Khanna, Retired Judge is at present acting as a Mediator. He will act as a Commissioner, to separate 30.14% of the assets of the company to be given to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda Group as set out hereinbefore. 10. Assets of the company will be valued as on 01.07.1988. 14. Shri Narendra Nath Nanda will continue to occupy the portion of the property of the company in which he is at present residing as deemed owner/owner, and the value of such portion will be taken into account for evaluating the assets of the company. The value of such part of the property as is occupied by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda will be adjusted in the value of his share. 16. That for the purpose of valuation of share of Shri Narendra Nath Nanda Group, the property No.K-72, Udyog Nagar, Rohtak Road, Delhi will be treated as the property  Page 3 of 9 of the company. 19. This agreement will be filed in the Suit No.1310 of 1988 and C.P. No.28 of 1988, and appropriate orders will be passed in the suit"". Justice P.N. Khanna acting as the Commissioner allotted the Golf Links property to the group of appellant No.2 even though he found that appellant No.2 and his group were entitled to get assets worth Rs.1.10 crores whereas the value of the property was Rs.1.82 crores. However, since further disputes arose between the parties the matter came up before the Court and it was agreed by the parties that the valuation of the shares of Respondent No.1 \026 Company namely, Kidarsons Industries Private Ltd. and the immovable properties owned by the Company shall be done, and for this purpose the Court by its order of August 30, 1990 appointed M/s. V. Shankar Aiyer and Company as the Chartered Accountants for valuing the assets of the Respondent No.1 \026 Company. They were required to work out the value of each share after valuing the assets as well as the liabilities of the Company. The Court passed an order to this effect on September 4, 1990. The Chartered Accountants gave their report and worked out the net assets of Respondent No.1 \026 Company at Rs.1,68,95,570/-. On that basis the value of each share was worked out as Rs.916/-. From this the valuers deducted 20% on account of provision restricting transfer of the shares of Respondent No.1 \026 Company. By this process, the value of each share was worked out to be Rs.733/-. Appellant No.2 filed his objections to the report of the Chartered Accountants which was dismissed by a learned Judge of the High Court by his Judgment and order dated February 5, 1993. Objections were raised such as those relating to valuation of goodwill, valuation of tenancy rights, valuation of Udyog Nagar plot, deduction from the value of the assets, provision for capital gains tax liability which may be payable on the hypothetical transfer of property, the deductions made from the value of the shares on account of restriction on transfer of the shares, and the question of allotment of a portion of the Golf Links property in favour of appellant No.2 Shri Narendra Nath Nanda in terms of Clause 14 of the settlement between the parties. In the instant appeal, we are only concerned with two issues namely, whether the portion of Golf Links property which at the time of settlement was occupied by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda be not allotted to him, and secondly, whether appropriate directions be given so that the appellants be made liable for payment of capital gains tax, if any, levied in future which levy shall be challenged by Respondent No.1 \026 Company, provided the funds are made available to it by the appellants for the purpose. At the threshold we may observe that the exercise undertaken by the High Court was with a view to give effect to the terms of settlement reached between the parties. It is trite that the terms of settlement reached between the parties shall ordinarily not be modified except with the consent of the parties. In the instant case, it has not been argued by anyone that the terms of settlement with which we are concerned are either illegal as being opposed to any statute or that it is hit by impossibility of performance and, therefore cannot be performed or that the settlement was not reached bona fide. Learned counsel appearing  Page 4 of 9 on behalf of the appellants submitted that Clause 14 of the settlement in clear terms provided that appellant No.2 was to continue to occupy the portion of the Golf Links property of the Company in which he was residing as deemed owner/owner, and that the value of such portion shall be taken into account for evaluating the assets of the Company. The value of such part of the property as was occupied by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda was to be adjusted in the value of his share. He submitted that the parties clearly agreed that Shri Narendra Nath Nanda, appellant No.2 will be allotted the portion of Golf Links property occupied by him on the date of settlement and that the value of the portion occupied by him shall be adjusted against the value of his share. It was submitted before us that in case anything more has to be paid that will be paid by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda, but the Respondents cannot insist on the ground of their convenience that the entire Golf Links property be allotted to them. The High Court in its impugned judgment has observed that having regard to the acrimony between the parties it was practically impossible for them to live in the same house. The strained relationship between the parties was evident from the fact that there had been instances of violence, and matters reached such a stage that reports were made to the police. The High Court also observed that being leasehold property, sub-division of the property was not permitted. It further observed that under the settlement, the appellants were entitled to 30.14% of the assets of the Company and only a sum not exceeding 5 lakhs could have been paid by the Company in cash, if the same was found necessary, and vice versa. Having regard to these circumstances the learned Judges held that the interpretation placed on Clause 14 by the learned Single Judge was correct and the said property could not in any manner be given to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda. We may observe that before us counsel appearing on behalf of Shri Narendra Nath Nanda gave up his claim of allotment of the entire Golf Links property to him and submitted that he will be satisfied if the portion in his occupation on the date of settlement is allotted to him. He has very strongly asserted that when a settlement had been reached which is sought to be given effect, the Court cannot re-write the settlement. There is no ambiguity in Clause 14 of the settlement, and there is nothing to indicate that it is unworkable, however inconvenient it may be to the respondent. Certainly, it was not incapable of being implemented and the architects may have a solution for their problem. It is submitted that if, however, the Court comes to the conclusion that Clause 14 cannot be given effect, it being one of the important conditions of the settlement, the whole agreement becomes un-enforceable with its concomitant consequences. It is, therefore, submitted that in terms of Clause 14 of the settlement the portion of the Golf Links property which was in occupation of Shri Narendra Nath Nanda ought to be demarcated and allotted to him and the value thereof be adjusted against his share. It is submitted that in the ultimate analysis the parties will themselves have to find a solution to their problems, if any, and learn to live peacefully in the premises. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent submitted that this was really a case of family settlement and the learned Judges have taken the broadest view of the matter with a view to give effect to the settlement reached between the parties. It is submitted that the over- all intention was to give respondent No.1 \026 Company to the contesting respondents and by compensating the appellants who are entitled to their 30.14% share in specie and the agency business of Thyssen. If the dominating intention of the parties has been effected minor issues like the one raised by the appellants should not defeat the settlement reached between the parties. It is submitted that a  Page 5 of 9 little ironing out of creases in family settlements must be permitted. It is therefore, submitted that the finding of the High Court on this aspect of the matter required no interference. Learned counsel for the respondents has brought to our notice a decision of the this Court in Kale and others vs. Deputy Director of Consolidation and others : (1976) 3 SCC 119 laying down the approach of the Court in giving effect to a bona fide family arrangement entered into between the parties with a view to resolving disputes once for all. This Court held that the family arrangements are governed by special equity peculiar to themselves and would be enforced if honestly made. Reference was made with approval to a passage appearing in Kerr on Fraud wherein the following pertinent observations appear:- ""The principles which apply to the case of ordinary compromise between strangers, do not equally apply to the case of compromises in the nature of family arrangements. Family arrangements are governed by a special equity peculiar to themselves, and will be enforced if honestly made, although they have not been meant as a compromise, but have proceeded from an error of all parties, originating in mistake or ignorance of fact as to what their rights actually are, or of the points on which their rights actually depend."" Reference was also made to the observations regarding the essentials of the family settlement and the principles governing the existence of the same in Halsbury’s Laws of England, Volume 17, Third Edition at pp. 215-216 which are as follows : "" A family arrangement is an agreement between members of the same family, intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of the family either by compromising doubtful or disputed rights or by preserving the family property or the peace and security of the family by avoiding litigation or by saving its honour.

He further submitted that so far as respondent - Company is concerned it does not get any consideration and, therefore, there is no question of any capital gains tax liability so far as respondent \026 Company is concerned. In any event even if the capital gains tax liability is imposed that will be the liability of the appellants herein, and they will be obliged to discharge that liability in accordance with law. Learned counsel for the appellant made a clear and categoric statement before us that if any liability arises out of the valuation of the assets or capital gains relating to properties covered by the settlement, the appellants shall be liable to discharge that liability. The appellants are willing to execute an undertaking to this effect and to creating a charge on the assets which may fall to their share for discharge of such tax liability, if any, imposed. It was submitted that there was no need to deduct this amount from the value of the assets of the Company and this Court may direct that in case such a liability arises in future and any demand is raised against respondent \026 Company of capital gains tax, the appellants shall be liable to discharge that liability. Respondent No.1 shall be entitled to challenge the tax demand, if any, for which necessary funds will be made available by the appellants. All this has been stated on the assumption that on a future date there is a demand of capital gains tax by the tax authority on the alleged transfers made under the settlement. We are of the view that since no demand of capital gains tax has been made so far, if any such demand is made in future in respect of the transfer of assets under the settlement for which 20% has been deducted by the Chartered Accountants, the respondent \026 Company shall challenge the demand provided the appellants shall place at its disposal necessary funds for the purpose. In any event the liability under the head ""capital gains"", if any, shall be that of the appellants who shall furnish an undertaking to this effect accepting their liability, and create a charge over the aforesaid assets to secure payment of capital gains tax, if any, imposed in future. Subject to this being done, there shall be no deduction from the value of the assets of the company of the anticipated liability of capital gains. below:- We, therefore, allow this appeal to the extent indicated a) that the judgment and order of the High Court is modified to the extent that appellant No.2, namely \026 Shri Narendra Nath Nanda shall be allotted the portion of the Golf Links house which was in his occupation on the date of settlement, and the value thereof shall be adjusted against his share. If something remains to be paid even after adjustment, the appellants shall pay such amount within a period of two months from the date of the order of the High Court. b) That no deduction shall be made from the value of the assets of the anticipated capital gains tax liability on the hypothetical sale under the settlement. In case a demand of capital gains tax is made by the tax authority in future against respondent \026 Company, the aforesaid Company shall be entitled to challenge the imposition of such tax subject to appellant No.2 providing sufficient funds to the respondent \026 Company for this purpose. In any event, the capital gains tax, if found payable, shall be the liability of the appellants to be discharged by them. They shall  Page 9 of 9 furnish an undertaking before the High Court accepting such liability, and shall execute a document creating a charge on the assets allocated to them under the settlement to discharge capital gains tax liability, if found payable. The matter is remitted to the High Court for giving effect to the aforesaid modifications which may involve directing the Chartered Accountants to make a re-calculation on the basis of the directions contained in this judgment, and apportion the assets accordingly. This appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above. Parties to bear their own costs. WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO.1705 OF 1999 Hansa Industries Pvt.

As regards 60 small bundles of safety fuse recovered from the godown of T.C.I, at Chikamberpur U.P. Ghaziabad border on 24.11.1990 which were part of the consignment booked by the appellant through T.C.I., Jaipur office vide consignment Note No. V-23343 and V-23344 both dated 14.11.1990, all these boxes were manufactured by Commercial Explosives, Nagpur. However, none of the boxes bore the box number. Accused-appellant had applied for renewal of licence from time to time and as such transaction of supply of safety fuse wire by Gopal Modi to the accused-appellant was in contravention of the provisions of Explosive Act. The accused-appellant had no licence to deal with gelatine or detonators and as such the transactions.to this effect were illegal and were to aid and abet the terrorist activities. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat had no licence to deal with gelatine or detonators but he had indulged, in such transaction pursuance to the criminal conspiracy as detailed above. He was having license to deal in gunpowder and 3 cases of safety fuses only. As regards detonators, in all 5200 special ordinary detonators and 500 electric detonators were recovered from the residence of accused-appellant and 11000 ordinary special detonators were recovered from the godown of T.C.I. Chikamberpur U.P. Ghaziabad border which was a part of the consignment booked on 14.11.1990 by the accused-appellant for transportation to Srinagar. These ordinary special detonators were manufactured by I.D.L. Chemicals Limited, Hyderabad and the remaining 500 electric detonators were manufactured by R.E.C.L., Dholpur. The batch number was not given on any of the packets of detonators. The 11000 ordinary special detonators recovered from T.C.I, godown Chikamberpur U.P. Ghaziabad border were supplied by the accused Kuldip Jain, proprietor of M/s. Bharat Explosives and Chemicals, Jaipur, to the accused-appellant of M/s Jaipur Acid Supply company, Jaipur. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat was engaged in abetting the terrorist activities in J and k and used to procure explosives from the co-accused as preparatory acts for the terrorist activities. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat used to take the delivery of the consignments so booked by the accused appellant of M/s Jaipur Acid Supply Company, Jaipur, through the branch office of T.C.I, and Economic Transport Organization. According to prosecution the above facts and circumstances of the case clearly establish that the accused Mohd. Ismail Bhatt, accused-appellant, Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain have committed offences punishable under Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short tha ’IPC’) read with Sections 3(1), 5 and 6 of TADA Act, Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act and Section 3(3) and 6 of TADA Act, Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act. Accused Krishna Gopal Soni has Committed offence punishable u/s. 9-B of the Act. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat was absconding and was declared absconder on 25.2.1994. By order of the Designated Court on 1.2.1996, the accused persons facing trial were discharged in respect of offences under Sections 3(3), 4, 6 of TADA Act and accused Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain were discharged in respect of offence’ under Section 5 of the TADA Act. Accused Krishna Gopal Soni was discharged in respect of offence under Section 9-B of Act. Thus, the case of co-accused Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain was transferred to the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jaipur under Section 18 of the TADA Act for trial of the offences relatable to Sections 6 and 9-B of the Act. Prosecution examined 43 witnesses to further its version. Accused appellant pleaded innocence and took a stand that he had a licence for his business, he has not present during search of his house and godowns, and gelatine and detonators were not seized from his premises. Since he had applied for renewal of his licence and there was no  Page 5 of 7 letter of cancellation, it is presumed that nothing illegal has been committed by him and he was falsely implicated. Learned trial Judge found the accused guilty for offences punishable under Section 5 of the TADA Act, Sections 4 and 5 of the Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act, after considering the evidence. He was sentenced to undergo five years imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000 with default stipulation in relation to Section 5 of the TADA Act, Similar custodial sentence was imposed for the offence under the Explosive Act and the Act and a fine of Rs. 5,000 for the offence under the Explosive Act and Rs. 3,000 under the Act default stipulation. The conviction was based on following incriminating circumstances: (1) recovery of gelatine and detonators from the room above the godown; (2) sale of articles to absconding accused which were seized at the U.P. Ghaziabad border when being taken back to Jaipur. The articles were kept in the godown of the two accused who were facing trial separately and, (3) the confessional statement was recorded before the Superintendent of Police strictly in accordance with law, and that was sufficient for finding the accused guilty with the aforesaid findings, the conclusions of guilt and award of sentence were done. In support of the appeal, it was submitted that conscious possession which is sine qua non for establishing the accusations has not been proved. It was clear from the evidence that the room from where the contraband articles were seized was easily accessible. Even the witnesses have not consistently said that the room and the almirah from where the articles were allegedly kept were not locked. The Explosives Controller’s report is not very clear. There is also no material to show where the articles were kept during the date of seizure and the date of report. Some of the witnesses have not specifically said about seizure of the articles. Section 5 refers to possession ""in present"". Even if it is held that at some point of time possession was there, and same was pursuant to any conspiracy, that cannot stick to the appellant as there was no charge under Section 120B of the IPC. The confessional statement was recorded without granting proper time for reflection. It is also submitted that the appellant is nearly 80 years of age and since accusations under the TADA Act have not been conclusively established and the appellant had already undergone custody for about 4 years, the sentence may be reduced to the period already undergone in case it is held that the accusations have been established. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the stand taken about conscious possession is clearly untenable because the room was part of the premises owned by the accused. There was not even any suggestion that somebody else had planted the articles. On the contrary, the suggestion was that one Chitarmal had kept the articles for safe custody. The confessional statement suffers from no legal infirmity and all requisite procedural safeguards have been taken. It is not the date of discovery which is relevant, and earlier possession subsequent to the date of notification is material. Merely because there has been a detection subsequently, it does not take away the rigor of Section 5. So far as the articles seized at the U.P. Ghaziabad border is concerned, a camouflage was made to take out the articles as if they are harmless chemicals. Appellant himself had admitted that he was previously having a licence to deal with explosives, but the licence was subsequently not renewed. Whether the almirah was locked or whether the room was locked or open does not make any difference when possession has been established. We shall first deal with the question relating to conscious possession. Whether there was conscious possession has to be determined with reference to the factual backdrop. The facts which can be culled out from the  Page 6 of 7 evidence on record is that the accused was owner of the premises. It has not even been remotely suggested that somebody else kept the articles, without his knowledge. It is highlighted that unless the possession was coupled with requisite mental element, i.e. conscious possession and not mere custody without awareness of the nature of such possession, Section 5 is not- attracted. The expression ’possession’ is polymorphous term which assumes .different colours in different contexts. It may carry different meanings in contextually different backgrounds. It is impossible, as was observed in Superintendent & Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Anil Kumar Bhunia and Ors., AIR (1980) SC 52, to work out a completely logical and precise definition of ""Possession"" uniformly applicable to all situations in the context of all statutes. The word ’conscious means awareness about a particular fact. It is a state of mind which is deliberate or intended. As noted in Gunwantlal v. The State of M.P., AIR (1972) SC 1756 possession in a given case need not be physical possession but can be constructive, having power and control over the article in case in question, while the person whom physical possession is given holds it subject to that power or control. The word ’possession’ means the legal right to possession (See Health v. Drown, [1972] 2 All Er 561 (HL). In an interesting case it was observed that where a person keeps his firearm in his mother’s flat which is safer than his own home, he must be considered to be in possession of the same. See Sullivan v. Earl of Caithness, [1976] 1 All ER 844 (QBD). Once possession is established the person who claims that it was not a conscious possession has to establish it, because how he came to be in possession is within his special knowledge. The factual scenario noticed by the trial Court is based on the evidence of PWs 2 and 5. The evidence of the Explosive Controller and the analysis made by him has been established. The Explosive Controller’s report shows that the seals were intact. In fact the suggestion given by the defence was that the goods were kept for safe custody by one Chitarmal. It strengthens the prosecution version rather than weakening it. Samples (Ext. 25) draw on 19.11.1990. It was found out that the articles were gelatine, electric detonator and detonator. There was an attempt to eraze the seals of the manufacturer on the seized containers. The Explosive Controller has indicated about the seals to be intact. In State of Tamil Nadu v. Sivarasan @ Raghu @ Sivarasa and Ors., [1997] 1 SCC 682 it was held that the prosecution must prove that the accused was in conscious possession unauthorisedly in a notified area of any specified arms and ammunition. The large quantities of the explosives and other contraband articles not only belies but militates against the very plea of the appellant relating to conscious possession. No further nexus with any terrorist or disruptive activity is required to be proved as a statutory presumption would arise that the said arm or explosive substance was meant to be used for a terrorist or disruptive act. Statements of Ramniwas (PW-7), Nand Singh (PW-5), Prabhu (PW-6) has been analysed in great detail. The Explosive Controller, Dr. S. Kamal was examined as PW-8. As rightly noticed by the trial Court in spite of lengthy cross examination, no crack has been noticed in their statements to discredit their testimony. It has been noticed by the trial Court that there was only one entrance towards the concerned room which was above the godown at the back of the house. It was not an open place as contended to which any one, without  Page 7 of 7 getting into the house itself, can gain entry. In Sivarasan’s case (supra) it was observed that gelatine goods were explosive substance within the meaning of Section 5 of the TADA Act. Since it is a complete article or device capable of exploding, ordinary detonator and electric detonators are also complete explosive substances within the purview of Section 5 of the TADA Act. Additionally, the ordinary detonator and electric detonator in huge quantity were seized. The possession of these articles in such large quantity by the accused has been proved and there is nothing to discard the prosecution version that the possession was conscious. Additionally, the confessional statement recorded by PW-4 does not suffer from any infirmity. Though it is desirable that sufficient time gap should be given to the declarant, in addition, to telling him that the statement could be used in law against him, there is no rigid formula as to what would be an adequate time. It would depend upon the circumstances of each case. On the facts of the present case, the time though was not very long, yet cannot be said to be too short to cast doubt on the voluntariness of the statement. At no point of time there was any challenge made that the statement which was produced in the Court in presence of the accused was not voluntary and/or was the result of coercion or undue influence or threat. In fact there was no denial of the fact that the statement was recorded. It has not been shown as to in what manner the accused has been prejudiced by non-granting of longer time. The statement recorded is very elaborate and the accused has inculpated himself with the details like the source of purchase of the articles which were within his personal and special knowledge. There is no reason to discard the evidence of PW-4, and The confessional statement. In S.N. Dube v. N.B. Bhoir and Ors., [2000] 2 SCC 254 it was held that neither Section 15 of the TADA Act nor rule 15 contemplates recording of confessional statement in two parts or giving time to the person making a confession to think over and re-consider whether he still wants to make the statement inspite of being told that he is not bound to make it and that it can be used against him. The ratio of this decision has full application to the facts of the present case. In view of these findings, it is not necessary to go into the other question whether the past transactions come within the umbrella of Section 5, though prima facie that appears to be the correct position. That being the position, the appeal is without merit and deserves dismissal, which we direct","JUDGMENT 2003 Supp(4) SCR 1 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. : Appellant was found guilty of offences punishable under Section 5 of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (in short the ""TADA Act""), Sections 4 and 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 (in short the ’Explosive Act’) and Section 9-B of Explosives Act, 1884 (in short the ’Act’) read with Rule 115 of Explosives Rules, 1983 (in short the ’Rules’).

Out of these 21 boxes, 13 boxes bearing Box Nos. 11363, 11365, 11370, 11371 11372, 11373, 11374, 11375, 11377, 11380, 11383, 11384 and 11385 were supplied by Commercial Explosives, Nagpur to Jaipur Acid Supply Company, Jaipur owned by the appellant, 7 boxes bearing box Nos. 31144, 31148, 31162, 31170, 31176, 31177 and 70177 were supplied by the manufacturer to M/s Jaipur Explosives and Chemicals, Jaipur owned by Shri Gopal Modi of Jaipur Explosives, Jaipur. The remaining one box bearing  Page 4 of 7 box No 11361 was supplied by the manufacturer to Twins Armoury of Trivandrum. As regards 60 small bundles of safety fuse recovered from the godown of T.C.I, at Chikamberpur U.P. Ghaziabad border on 24.11.1990 which were part of the consignment booked by the appellant through T.C.I., Jaipur office vide consignment Note No. V-23343 and V-23344 both dated 14.11.1990, all these boxes were manufactured by Commercial Explosives, Nagpur. However, none of the boxes bore the box number. Accused-appellant had applied for renewal of licence from time to time and as such transaction of supply of safety fuse wire by Gopal Modi to the accused-appellant was in contravention of the provisions of Explosive Act. The accused-appellant had no licence to deal with gelatine or detonators and as such the transactions.to this effect were illegal and were to aid and abet the terrorist activities. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat had no licence to deal with gelatine or detonators but he had indulged, in such transaction pursuance to the criminal conspiracy as detailed above. He was having license to deal in gunpowder and 3 cases of safety fuses only. As regards detonators, in all 5200 special ordinary detonators and 500 electric detonators were recovered from the residence of accused-appellant and 11000 ordinary special detonators were recovered from the godown of T.C.I. Chikamberpur U.P. Ghaziabad border which was a part of the consignment booked on 14.11.1990 by the accused-appellant for transportation to Srinagar. These ordinary special detonators were manufactured by I.D.L. Chemicals Limited, Hyderabad and the remaining 500 electric detonators were manufactured by R.E.C.L., Dholpur. The batch number was not given on any of the packets of detonators. The 11000 ordinary special detonators recovered from T.C.I, godown Chikamberpur U.P. Ghaziabad border were supplied by the accused Kuldip Jain, proprietor of M/s. Bharat Explosives and Chemicals, Jaipur, to the accused-appellant of M/s Jaipur Acid Supply company, Jaipur. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat was engaged in abetting the terrorist activities in J and k and used to procure explosives from the co-accused as preparatory acts for the terrorist activities. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat used to take the delivery of the consignments so booked by the accused appellant of M/s Jaipur Acid Supply Company, Jaipur, through the branch office of T.C.I, and Economic Transport Organization. According to prosecution the above facts and circumstances of the case clearly establish that the accused Mohd. Ismail Bhatt, accused-appellant, Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain have committed offences punishable under Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short tha ’IPC’) read with Sections 3(1), 5 and 6 of TADA Act, Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act and Section 3(3) and 6 of TADA Act, Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act. Accused Krishna Gopal Soni has Committed offence punishable u/s. 9-B of the Act. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat was absconding and was declared absconder on 25.2.1994. By order of the Designated Court on 1.2.1996, the accused persons facing trial were discharged in respect of offences under Sections 3(3), 4, 6 of TADA Act and accused Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain were discharged in respect of offence’ under Section 5 of the TADA Act. Accused Krishna Gopal Soni was discharged in respect of offence under Section 9-B of Act. Thus, the case of co-accused Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain was transferred to the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jaipur under Section 18 of the TADA Act for trial of the offences relatable to Sections 6 and 9-B of the Act. Prosecution examined 43 witnesses to further its version. Accused appellant pleaded innocence and took a stand that he had a licence for his business, he has not present during search of his house and godowns, and gelatine and detonators were not seized from his premises. Since he had applied for renewal of his licence and there was no  Page 5 of 7 letter of cancellation, it is presumed that nothing illegal has been committed by him and he was falsely implicated. Learned trial Judge found the accused guilty for offences punishable under Section 5 of the TADA Act, Sections 4 and 5 of the Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act, after considering the evidence. He was sentenced to undergo five years imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000 with default stipulation in relation to Section 5 of the TADA Act, Similar custodial sentence was imposed for the offence under the Explosive Act and the Act and a fine of Rs. 5,000 for the offence under the Explosive Act and Rs. 3,000 under the Act default stipulation. The conviction was based on following incriminating circumstances: (1) recovery of gelatine and detonators from the room above the godown; (2) sale of articles to absconding accused which were seized at the U.P. Ghaziabad border when being taken back to Jaipur. The articles were kept in the godown of the two accused who were facing trial separately and, (3) the confessional statement was recorded before the Superintendent of Police strictly in accordance with law, and that was sufficient for finding the accused guilty with the aforesaid findings, the conclusions of guilt and award of sentence were done. In support of the appeal, it was submitted that conscious possession which is sine qua non for establishing the accusations has not been proved. It was clear from the evidence that the room from where the contraband articles were seized was easily accessible. Even the witnesses have not consistently said that the room and the almirah from where the articles were allegedly kept were not locked. The Explosives Controller’s report is not very clear. There is also no material to show where the articles were kept during the date of seizure and the date of report. Some of the witnesses have not specifically said about seizure of the articles. Section 5 refers to possession ""in present"". Even if it is held that at some point of time possession was there, and same was pursuant to any conspiracy, that cannot stick to the appellant as there was no charge under Section 120B of the IPC. The confessional statement was recorded without granting proper time for reflection. It is also submitted that the appellant is nearly 80 years of age and since accusations under the TADA Act have not been conclusively established and the appellant had already undergone custody for about 4 years, the sentence may be reduced to the period already undergone in case it is held that the accusations have been established. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the stand taken about conscious possession is clearly untenable because the room was part of the premises owned by the accused. There was not even any suggestion that somebody else had planted the articles. On the contrary, the suggestion was that one Chitarmal had kept the articles for safe custody. The confessional statement suffers from no legal infirmity and all requisite procedural safeguards have been taken. It is not the date of discovery which is relevant, and earlier possession subsequent to the date of notification is material. Merely because there has been a detection subsequently, it does not take away the rigor of Section 5. So far as the articles seized at the U.P. Ghaziabad border is concerned, a camouflage was made to take out the articles as if they are harmless chemicals. Appellant himself had admitted that he was previously having a licence to deal with explosives, but the licence was subsequently not renewed. Whether the almirah was locked or whether the room was locked or open does not make any difference when possession has been established. We shall first deal with the question relating to conscious possession. Whether there was conscious possession has to be determined with reference to the factual backdrop. The facts which can be culled out from the  Page 6 of 7 evidence on record is that the accused was owner of the premises. It has not even been remotely suggested that somebody else kept the articles, without his knowledge. It is highlighted that unless the possession was coupled with requisite mental element, i.e. conscious possession and not mere custody without awareness of the nature of such possession, Section 5 is not- attracted. The expression ’possession’ is polymorphous term which assumes .different colours in different contexts. It may carry different meanings in contextually different backgrounds. It is impossible, as was observed in Superintendent & Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Anil Kumar Bhunia and Ors., AIR (1980) SC 52, to work out a completely logical and precise definition of ""Possession"" uniformly applicable to all situations in the context of all statutes. The word ’conscious means awareness about a particular fact. It is a state of mind which is deliberate or intended. As noted in Gunwantlal v. The State of M.P., AIR (1972) SC 1756 possession in a given case need not be physical possession but can be constructive, having power and control over the article in case in question, while the person whom physical possession is given holds it subject to that power or control. The word ’possession’ means the legal right to possession (See Health v. Drown, [1972] 2 All Er 561 (HL). In an interesting case it was observed that where a person keeps his firearm in his mother’s flat which is safer than his own home, he must be considered to be in possession of the same. See Sullivan v. Earl of Caithness, [1976] 1 All ER 844 (QBD). Once possession is established the person who claims that it was not a conscious possession has to establish it, because how he came to be in possession is within his special knowledge. The factual scenario noticed by the trial Court is based on the evidence of PWs 2 and 5. The evidence of the Explosive Controller and the analysis made by him has been established. The Explosive Controller’s report shows that the seals were intact. In fact the suggestion given by the defence was that the goods were kept for safe custody by one Chitarmal. It strengthens the prosecution version rather than weakening it. Samples (Ext. 25) draw on 19.11.1990. It was found out that the articles were gelatine, electric detonator and detonator. There was an attempt to eraze the seals of the manufacturer on the seized containers. The Explosive Controller has indicated about the seals to be intact. In State of Tamil Nadu v. Sivarasan @ Raghu @ Sivarasa and Ors., [1997] 1 SCC 682 it was held that the prosecution must prove that the accused was in conscious possession unauthorisedly in a notified area of any specified arms and ammunition. The large quantities of the explosives and other contraband articles not only belies but militates against the very plea of the appellant relating to conscious possession. No further nexus with any terrorist or disruptive activity is required to be proved as a statutory presumption would arise that the said arm or explosive substance was meant to be used for a terrorist or disruptive act. Statements of Ramniwas (PW-7), Nand Singh (PW-5), Prabhu (PW-6) has been analysed in great detail. The Explosive Controller, Dr. S. Kamal was examined as PW-8. As rightly noticed by the trial Court in spite of lengthy cross examination, no crack has been noticed in their statements to discredit their testimony. It has been noticed by the trial Court that there was only one entrance towards the concerned room which was above the godown at the back of the house. It was not an open place as contended to which any one, without  Page 7 of 7 getting into the house itself, can gain entry. In Sivarasan’s case (supra) it was observed that gelatine goods were explosive substance within the meaning of Section 5 of the TADA Act. Since it is a complete article or device capable of exploding, ordinary detonator and electric detonators are also complete explosive substances within the purview of Section 5 of the TADA Act. Additionally, the ordinary detonator and electric detonator in huge quantity were seized. The possession of these articles in such large quantity by the accused has been proved and there is nothing to discard the prosecution version that the possession was conscious. Additionally, the confessional statement recorded by PW-4 does not suffer from any infirmity. Though it is desirable that sufficient time gap should be given to the declarant, in addition, to telling him that the statement could be used in law against him, there is no rigid formula as to what would be an adequate time. It would depend upon the circumstances of each case. On the facts of the present case, the time though was not very long, yet cannot be said to be too short to cast doubt on the voluntariness of the statement. At no point of time there was any challenge made that the statement which was produced in the Court in presence of the accused was not voluntary and/or was the result of coercion or undue influence or threat. In fact there was no denial of the fact that the statement was recorded. It has not been shown as to in what manner the accused has been prejudiced by non-granting of longer time. The statement recorded is very elaborate and the accused has inculpated himself with the details like the source of purchase of the articles which were within his personal and special knowledge. There is no reason to discard the evidence of PW-4, and The confessional statement. In S.N. Dube v. N.B. Bhoir and Ors., [2000] 2 SCC 254 it was held that neither Section 15 of the TADA Act nor rule 15 contemplates recording of confessional statement in two parts or giving time to the person making a confession to think over and re-consider whether he still wants to make the statement inspite of being told that he is not bound to make it and that it can be used against him. The ratio of this decision has full application to the facts of the present case. In view of these findings, it is not necessary to go into the other question whether the past transactions come within the umbrella of Section 5, though prima facie that appears to be the correct position. That being the position, the appeal is without merit and deserves dismissal, which we direct"
20,Appeal (civil) 1682 of 1999,Hansa Industries Pvt. Ltd. and others,Kidarsons Industries Pvt. Ltd,13/10/2006,B.P. SINGH & ALTAMAS KABIR,"J U D G M E N T B.P. SINGH, J. This appeal by Special Leave is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi dated March 25, 1998 in F.A.O (O.S.) No.39 of 1993, whereby the Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellants herein against the order of the learned Single Judge dismissing their objections to the report of the Chartered Accountants who had valued the share of Respondent No.1 \026 Company, and directing the implementation of the settlement arrived at between the parties on 9th June, 1988. This Court while granting special leave by its Order dated March 19, 1999 restricted the appeal to two issues only as recorded in the order of this Court dated August 10, 1998, namely issues relating: ""(a) The portion of the Golf Links property which was in the possession of N.N. Nanda. (b) Modification of the Division Bench order so that it is stated that the company shall challenge the imposition of capital gains tax, if any provided funds for that purpose are furnished by the appellants"". To appreciate the background in which the two aforesaid issues arise, it is necessary to refer to the factual background of the case. The relevant facts are really not in dispute. The Respondent No.1 \026 Company, namely \026 Kidarsons Industries Pvt. Ltd. is a Private Limited Company closely held by the Nanda family. Except for a few shares held by their relatives and friends the entire shareholding of the Company is that of the members of the Nanda family. Appellant No.2 before us is Shri Narendra Nath Nanda. His three brothers namely, Mohinder Nath, Varinder Nath and Rajinder Nath were the respondents in the High Court alongwith their mother, who is no more. The main source of income of Respondent No.1 \026 Company was the commission earned from the agency business of M/s. Thyssen Sthal Union of Germany (hereinafter referred to as ’Thyssen’). Disputes arose between the brothers, and it appears that appellant No.2 succeeded in getting the agency exclusively in his name. M/s. Thyssen served a notice on Respondent No.1 \026 Company terminating their agency w.e.f. June   of 9 30, 1988 and thereafter the agency was given to appellant No.1, namely Hansa Industries Private Limited, a company controlled by appellant No.2. After the termination of the agency of Respondent No.1 \026 Company, the appellants herein filed a petition for winding up of Respondent No.1 \026 Company alleging that the agency having been terminated, the main source of income of the Company had vanished and, therefore, it was just and equitable to wind up the Company. On the other hand, the Respondents filed a suit for declaration and for injunction restraining the appellants from carrying on the agency business by holding themselves out as the agent of M/s. Thyssen. During the pendency of the proceedings the parties arrived at a compromise whereby appellant No.2 Narendra Nath Nanda and his group agreed to transfer their equity shares in Kidarsons Industries (P) Ltd. Respondent No.1 \026 Company, constituting 30.14% of the share capital of Respondent No.1 \026 Company, in favour of the respondents. The price of the shares was to be paid in specie by transferring to the appellants 30.14% of the assets of the Company. The agency of Thyssen was to be retained by Narendra Nath Nanda, appellant No.2 and his group. The relevant terms of the settlement are the following: ""2. That the price of the aforesaid 5654 (later corrected as 5564) equity shares of Kidarsons Industries (P) Ltd., will be paid to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda, and/or his nominees in specie by Company by transferring to him 30.14% of the assets of the Company. Marginal amount not exceeding 5 lakhs may be paid by the company to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda and/or his nominees as the case may be, in cash if found necessary. Similarly Shri Narendra Nath Nanda may make similar compensatory equilisation payment to the company. Parties by consent can, however, agree to a larger amount. 6. That Shri P.N Khanna, Retired Judge is at present acting as a Mediator. He will act as a Commissioner, to separate 30.14% of the assets of the company to be given to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda Group as set out hereinbefore. 10. Assets of the company will be valued as on 01.07.1988. 14. Shri Narendra Nath Nanda will continue to occupy the portion of the property of the company in which he is at present residing as deemed owner/owner, and the value of such portion will be taken into account for evaluating the assets of the company. The value of such part of the property as is occupied by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda will be adjusted in the value of his share. 16. That for the purpose of valuation of share of Shri Narendra Nath Nanda Group, the property No.K-72, Udyog Nagar, Rohtak Road, Delhi will be treated as the property  Page 3 of 9 of the company. 19. This agreement will be filed in the Suit No.1310 of 1988 and C.P. No.28 of 1988, and appropriate orders will be passed in the suit"". Justice P.N. Khanna acting as the Commissioner allotted the Golf Links property to the group of appellant No.2 even though he found that appellant No.2 and his group were entitled to get assets worth Rs.1.10 crores whereas the value of the property was Rs.1.82 crores. However, since further disputes arose between the parties the matter came up before the Court and it was agreed by the parties that the valuation of the shares of Respondent No.1 \026 Company namely, Kidarsons Industries Private Ltd. and the immovable properties owned by the Company shall be done, and for this purpose the Court by its order of August 30, 1990 appointed M/s. V. Shankar Aiyer and Company as the Chartered Accountants for valuing the assets of the Respondent No.1 \026 Company. They were required to work out the value of each share after valuing the assets as well as the liabilities of the Company. The Court passed an order to this effect on September 4, 1990. The Chartered Accountants gave their report and worked out the net assets of Respondent No.1 \026 Company at Rs.1,68,95,570/-. On that basis the value of each share was worked out as Rs.916/-. From this the valuers deducted 20% on account of provision restricting transfer of the shares of Respondent No.1 \026 Company. By this process, the value of each share was worked out to be Rs.733/-. Appellant No.2 filed his objections to the report of the Chartered Accountants which was dismissed by a learned Judge of the High Court by his Judgment and order dated February 5, 1993. Objections were raised such as those relating to valuation of goodwill, valuation of tenancy rights, valuation of Udyog Nagar plot, deduction from the value of the assets, provision for capital gains tax liability which may be payable on the hypothetical transfer of property, the deductions made from the value of the shares on account of restriction on transfer of the shares, and the question of allotment of a portion of the Golf Links property in favour of appellant No.2 Shri Narendra Nath Nanda in terms of Clause 14 of the settlement between the parties. In the instant appeal, we are only concerned with two issues namely, whether the portion of Golf Links property which at the time of settlement was occupied by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda be not allotted to him, and secondly, whether appropriate directions be given so that the appellants be made liable for payment of capital gains tax, if any, levied in future which levy shall be challenged by Respondent No.1 \026 Company, provided the funds are made available to it by the appellants for the purpose. At the threshold we may observe that the exercise undertaken by the High Court was with a view to give effect to the terms of settlement reached between the parties. It is trite that the terms of settlement reached between the parties shall ordinarily not be modified except with the consent of the parties. In the instant case, it has not been argued by anyone that the terms of settlement with which we are concerned are either illegal as being opposed to any statute or that it is hit by impossibility of performance and, therefore cannot be performed or that the settlement was not reached bona fide. Learned counsel appearing  Page 4 of 9 on behalf of the appellants submitted that Clause 14 of the settlement in clear terms provided that appellant No.2 was to continue to occupy the portion of the Golf Links property of the Company in which he was residing as deemed owner/owner, and that the value of such portion shall be taken into account for evaluating the assets of the Company. The value of such part of the property as was occupied by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda was to be adjusted in the value of his share. He submitted that the parties clearly agreed that Shri Narendra Nath Nanda, appellant No.2 will be allotted the portion of Golf Links property occupied by him on the date of settlement and that the value of the portion occupied by him shall be adjusted against the value of his share. It was submitted before us that in case anything more has to be paid that will be paid by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda, but the Respondents cannot insist on the ground of their convenience that the entire Golf Links property be allotted to them. The High Court in its impugned judgment has observed that having regard to the acrimony between the parties it was practically impossible for them to live in the same house. The strained relationship between the parties was evident from the fact that there had been instances of violence, and matters reached such a stage that reports were made to the police. The High Court also observed that being leasehold property, sub-division of the property was not permitted. It further observed that under the settlement, the appellants were entitled to 30.14% of the assets of the Company and only a sum not exceeding 5 lakhs could have been paid by the Company in cash, if the same was found necessary, and vice versa. Having regard to these circumstances the learned Judges held that the interpretation placed on Clause 14 by the learned Single Judge was correct and the said property could not in any manner be given to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda. We may observe that before us counsel appearing on behalf of Shri Narendra Nath Nanda gave up his claim of allotment of the entire Golf Links property to him and submitted that he will be satisfied if the portion in his occupation on the date of settlement is allotted to him. He has very strongly asserted that when a settlement had been reached which is sought to be given effect, the Court cannot re-write the settlement. There is no ambiguity in Clause 14 of the settlement, and there is nothing to indicate that it is unworkable, however inconvenient it may be to the respondent. Certainly, it was not incapable of being implemented and the architects may have a solution for their problem. It is submitted that if, however, the Court comes to the conclusion that Clause 14 cannot be given effect, it being one of the important conditions of the settlement, the whole agreement becomes un-enforceable with its concomitant consequences. It is, therefore, submitted that in terms of Clause 14 of the settlement the portion of the Golf Links property which was in occupation of Shri Narendra Nath Nanda ought to be demarcated and allotted to him and the value thereof be adjusted against his share. It is submitted that in the ultimate analysis the parties will themselves have to find a solution to their problems, if any, and learn to live peacefully in the premises. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent submitted that this was really a case of family settlement and the learned Judges have taken the broadest view of the matter with a view to give effect to the settlement reached between the parties. It is submitted that the over- all intention was to give respondent No.1 \026 Company to the contesting respondents and by compensating the appellants who are entitled to their 30.14% share in specie and the agency business of Thyssen. If the dominating intention of the parties has been effected minor issues like the one raised by the appellants should not defeat the settlement reached between the parties. It is submitted that a  Page 5 of 9 little ironing out of creases in family settlements must be permitted. It is therefore, submitted that the finding of the High Court on this aspect of the matter required no interference. Learned counsel for the respondents has brought to our notice a decision of the this Court in Kale and others vs. Deputy Director of Consolidation and others : (1976) 3 SCC 119 laying down the approach of the Court in giving effect to a bona fide family arrangement entered into between the parties with a view to resolving disputes once for all. This Court held that the family arrangements are governed by special equity peculiar to themselves and would be enforced if honestly made. Reference was made with approval to a passage appearing in Kerr on Fraud wherein the following pertinent observations appear:- ""The principles which apply to the case of ordinary compromise between strangers, do not equally apply to the case of compromises in the nature of family arrangements. Family arrangements are governed by a special equity peculiar to themselves, and will be enforced if honestly made, although they have not been meant as a compromise, but have proceeded from an error of all parties, originating in mistake or ignorance of fact as to what their rights actually are, or of the points on which their rights actually depend."" Reference was also made to the observations regarding the essentials of the family settlement and the principles governing the existence of the same in Halsbury’s Laws of England, Volume 17, Third Edition at pp. 215-216 which are as follows : "" A family arrangement is an agreement between members of the same family, intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of the family either by compromising doubtful or disputed rights or by preserving the family property or the peace and security of the family by avoiding litigation or by saving its honour. The agreement may be implied from a long course of dealing, but it is more usual to embody or to effectuate the agreement in a deed to which the term ""family arrangement"" is applied. Family arrangements are governed by principles which are not applicable to dealings between strangers. The Court, when deciding the rights of parties under family arrangements or claims to upset such arrangements, considers what in the broadest view of the matter is most for the interest of families, and has regard to considerations which, in dealing with transactions between persons not members of the same family, would not be taken into account. Matters which would be fatal to the validity of similar transactions between strangers are not objections to the binding effect of family arrangements."" This Court held that courts have leaned in favour of upholding a family arrangement instead of disturbing the same on technical or trivial grounds. Where the courts find that the family arrangement suffers from a legal lacuna or a formal defect the rule of estoppel is pressed into service and is applied to shut out plea of the person who being a party to family arrangement seeks to unsettle a settled dispute and claims to revoke the family arrangement under which he has himself enjoyed some material benefits. The principles were concretized and succinctly reduced to the following propositions :  Page 6 of 9 ""(1) The family settlement must be a bona fide one so as to resolve family disputes and rival claims by a fair and equitable division or allotment of properties between the various members of the family; (2) The said settlement must be voluntary and should not be induced by fraud, coercion or undue influence; (3) The family arrangement may be even oral in which case no registration is necessary; (4) It is well settled that registration would be necessary only if the terms of the family arrangement are reduced into writing. Here also, a distinction should be made between a document containing the terms and recitals of a family arrangement made under the document and a mere memorandum prepared after the family arrangement had already been made either for the purpose of the record or for information of the Court for making necessary mutation. In such a case the memorandum itself does not create or extinguish any rights in immoveable properties and therefore does not fall within the mischief of Section 17(2) (sic) (Section 17(1)(b)?) of the Registration Act and is, therefore, not compulsorily registrable; (5) The members who may be parties to the family arrangement must have some antecedent title, claim or interest even a possible claim in the property which is acknowledged by the parties to the settlement. Even if one of the parties to the settlement has no title but under the arrangement the other party relinquishes all its claims or titles in favour of such a person and acknowledges him to be the sole owner, then the antecedent title must be assumed and the family arrangement will be upheld, and the Courts will find no difficulty in giving assent to the same; (6) Even if bona fide disputes, present or possible, which may not involve legal claims are settled by a bona fide family arrangement which is fair and equitable the family arrangement is final and binding on the parties to the settlement."" The aforesaid judgment of this Court refers to many other decisions to which we need not advert in this case but some of those decisions do take the view that a compromise or family arrangement is based on the assumption that there is an antecedent title of some sort in the parties and the agreement acknowledges and defines what that title is, each party relinquishing all claims to property other than that falling to his share and recognising the right of the others, as they had previously asserted it, to the portions allotted to them respectively. That explains why no conveyance is required in these cases to pass the title from the one in whom it resides to the person receiving it under the family arrangement. It is assumed that the title claimed by the person receiving the property under the arrangement had always resided in him or her so far as the property falling to his or her share is concerned and therefore no conveyance is necessary. We have made the above observations only because it has some relevance to the second issue which arises for our consideration in this appeal. It is true that the High Court has taken note of the practicalities of the situation and has proceeded on the basis that the appellants and the respondents cannot peacefully live in the same premises. The High Court has, therefore, not favoured allotment of a portion of the house in favour of appellant No.2 and has approved the allotment of the house to the respondents  Page 7 of 9 who owned the majority shares in the respondent No.1 \026 Company. This was done with a view to ensure that the parties live separately but in peace and harmony. We cannot find fault with the concern shown by the High Court, but the problem which arises in the instant case is that the High Court was not considering a matter in which it could have exercised its discretion to make allotment one way or the other as in a case of family partition. The decree of the Court is based upon a settlement reached between the parties. Even at the time when the settlement was reached the parties were well aware of the strained relationship which existed and the unfortunate events that occurred between the branch of appellant No.2 and the remaining members of the family. Despite this, it was agreed by all of them that the portion in occupation of appellant No.2 shall be allotted to him and the value thereof adjusted against his share. The respondents cannot now be heard to say that it would be inconvenient for them to reside with appellant No.2 and his family members in the same house, though in separate portions. The question as to how the parties will manage their affairs is a matter with which they only are primarily concerned and the Court cannot advise them in the matter. It may be that the architects may provide a solution for their problems, or it may be that in view of the circumstances one party may agree to sell its share or buy the share of the other party with a view to purchase peace, if that becomes necessary. These are matters in which the Court may have nothing to say. Clause 14 of the settlement being unambiguous, clear and categoric, it must be given effect because one cannot term the said Clause 14 as vitiated by fraud, or illegal being in breach of any statutory provision, or against public policy, or hit by the principle of impossibility of performance. The settlement was made bona fide by the parties to resolve all their disputes and all facts were known to the parties when they reached the settlement. With their eyes open and fully aware of their experiences of the past, they agreed to share the Golf Links property. The relevant clause in the settlement is not vitiated by any consideration which may impel the court not to give effect to that clause in the settlement. The question of practical inconvenience should have concerned the respondents when they entered into the settlement. They cannot at the stage of implementation of the settlement avoid a covenant in the settlement solemnly incorporated with their consent on the pretext of practical inconvenience of living in the same house, albeit in separate portions, in the unfortunate background of bickerings and acrimony. This issue must, therefore, be decided in favour of the appellants. The next question is whether the judgment of the High Court could be suitably modified to provide for challenge by respondent -Company to any order that may be passed in future by the tax authority imposing capital gains tax on the hypothetical transfers made under the settlement. We find from the judgment of the High Court that the matter was discussed at length and the Court was of the view, prima facie, that the transfers may attract capital gains tax. There was, therefore, justification for deduction of the anticipated capital gains tax liability from the total value of assets. Before us learned counsel for the respondent did not want to join issue on this question and left it to us to pass an appropriate order. Learned counsel for the appellants argued before us that no capital gains tax is payable in the instant case because the transfers are by virtue of an order of the Court and, therefore, Sections 100 to 104 of the Companies Act are attracted. There is in reality no transfer or sale that may attract capital gains  Page 8 of 9 tax, in view of the pre-existing right and title of the parties which gets crystalised under a family arrangement. He further submitted that so far as respondent - Company is concerned it does not get any consideration and, therefore, there is no question of any capital gains tax liability so far as respondent \026 Company is concerned. In any event even if the capital gains tax liability is imposed that will be the liability of the appellants herein, and they will be obliged to discharge that liability in accordance with law. Learned counsel for the appellant made a clear and categoric statement before us that if any liability arises out of the valuation of the assets or capital gains relating to properties covered by the settlement, the appellants shall be liable to discharge that liability. The appellants are willing to execute an undertaking to this effect and to creating a charge on the assets which may fall to their share for discharge of such tax liability, if any, imposed. It was submitted that there was no need to deduct this amount from the value of the assets of the Company and this Court may direct that in case such a liability arises in future and any demand is raised against respondent \026 Company of capital gains tax, the appellants shall be liable to discharge that liability. Respondent No.1 shall be entitled to challenge the tax demand, if any, for which necessary funds will be made available by the appellants. All this has been stated on the assumption that on a future date there is a demand of capital gains tax by the tax authority on the alleged transfers made under the settlement. We are of the view that since no demand of capital gains tax has been made so far, if any such demand is made in future in respect of the transfer of assets under the settlement for which 20% has been deducted by the Chartered Accountants, the respondent \026 Company shall challenge the demand provided the appellants shall place at its disposal necessary funds for the purpose. In any event the liability under the head ""capital gains"", if any, shall be that of the appellants who shall furnish an undertaking to this effect accepting their liability, and create a charge over the aforesaid assets to secure payment of capital gains tax, if any, imposed in future. Subject to this being done, there shall be no deduction from the value of the assets of the company of the anticipated liability of capital gains. below:- We, therefore, allow this appeal to the extent indicated a) that the judgment and order of the High Court is modified to the extent that appellant No.2, namely \026 Shri Narendra Nath Nanda shall be allotted the portion of the Golf Links house which was in his occupation on the date of settlement, and the value thereof shall be adjusted against his share. If something remains to be paid even after adjustment, the appellants shall pay such amount within a period of two months from the date of the order of the High Court. b) That no deduction shall be made from the value of the assets of the anticipated capital gains tax liability on the hypothetical sale under the settlement. In case a demand of capital gains tax is made by the tax authority in future against respondent \026 Company, the aforesaid Company shall be entitled to challenge the imposition of such tax subject to appellant No.2 providing sufficient funds to the respondent \026 Company for this purpose. In any event, the capital gains tax, if found payable, shall be the liability of the appellants to be discharged by them. They shall  Page 9 of 9 furnish an undertaking before the High Court accepting such liability, and shall execute a document creating a charge on the assets allocated to them under the settlement to discharge capital gains tax liability, if found payable. The matter is remitted to the High Court for giving effect to the aforesaid modifications which may involve directing the Chartered Accountants to make a re-calculation on the basis of the directions contained in this judgment, and apportion the assets accordingly. This appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above. Parties to bear their own costs. WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO.1705 OF 1999 Hansa Industries Pvt. Ltd. and others \005Appellants Versus Kidarsons Industries Pvt. Ltd. \005Respondent J U D G M E N T B.P. SINGH, J. In view of the judgment passed by us today in Civil Appeal No. 1682 of 1999 it is not necessary to pass any order in this appeal. The appeal stands disposed of.","J U D G M E N T B.P. SINGH, J. This appeal by Special Leave is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi dated March 25, 1998 in F.A.O (O.S.) No.39 of 1993, whereby the Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellants herein against the order of the learned Single Judge dismissing their objections to the report of the Chartered Accountants who had valued the share of Respondent No.1 \026 Company, and directing the implementation of the settlement arrived at between the parties on 9th June, 1988. This Court while granting special leave by its Order dated March 19, 1999 restricted the appeal to two issues only as recorded in the order of this Court dated August 10, 1998, namely issues relating: ""(a) The portion of the Golf Links property which was in the possession of N.N. Nanda. (b) Modification of the Division Bench order so that it is stated that the company shall challenge the imposition of capital gains tax, if any provided funds for that purpose are furnished by the appellants"". To appreciate the background in which the two aforesaid issues arise, it is necessary to refer to the factual background of the case. The relevant facts are really not in dispute. The Respondent No.1 \026 Company, namely \026 Kidarsons Industries Pvt. Ltd. is a Private Limited Company closely held by the Nanda family. Except for a few shares held by their relatives and friends the entire shareholding of the Company is that of the members of the Nanda family. Appellant No.2 before us is Shri Narendra Nath Nanda. His three brothers namely, Mohinder Nath, Varinder Nath and Rajinder Nath were the respondents in the High Court alongwith their mother, who is no more. The main source of income of Respondent No.1 \026 Company was the commission earned from the agency business of M/s. Thyssen Sthal Union of Germany (hereinafter referred to as ’Thyssen’). Disputes arose between the brothers, and it appears that appellant No.2 succeeded in getting the agency exclusively in his name. M/s. Thyssen served a notice on Respondent No.1 \026 Company terminating their agency w.e.f. June   of 9 30, 1988 and thereafter the agency was given to appellant No.1, namely Hansa Industries Private Limited, a company controlled by appellant No.2. After the termination of the agency of Respondent No.1 \026 Company, the appellants herein filed a petition for winding up of Respondent No.1 \026 Company alleging that the agency having been terminated, the main source of income of the Company had vanished and, therefore, it was just and equitable to wind up the Company. On the other hand, the Respondents filed a suit for declaration and for injunction restraining the appellants from carrying on the agency business by holding themselves out as the agent of M/s. Thyssen. During the pendency of the proceedings the parties arrived at a compromise whereby appellant No.2 Narendra Nath Nanda and his group agreed to transfer their equity shares in Kidarsons Industries (P) Ltd. Respondent No.1 \026 Company, constituting 30.14% of the share capital of Respondent No.1 \026 Company, in favour of the respondents. The price of the shares was to be paid in specie by transferring to the appellants 30.14% of the assets of the Company. The agency of Thyssen was to be retained by Narendra Nath Nanda, appellant No.2 and his group. The relevant terms of the settlement are the following: ""2. That the price of the aforesaid 5654 (later corrected as 5564) equity shares of Kidarsons Industries (P) Ltd., will be paid to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda, and/or his nominees in specie by Company by transferring to him 30.14% of the assets of the Company. Marginal amount not exceeding 5 lakhs may be paid by the company to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda and/or his nominees as the case may be, in cash if found necessary. Similarly Shri Narendra Nath Nanda may make similar compensatory equilisation payment to the company. Parties by consent can, however, agree to a larger amount. 6. That Shri P.N Khanna, Retired Judge is at present acting as a Mediator. He will act as a Commissioner, to separate 30.14% of the assets of the company to be given to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda Group as set out hereinbefore. 10. Assets of the company will be valued as on 01.07.1988. 14. Shri Narendra Nath Nanda will continue to occupy the portion of the property of the company in which he is at present residing as deemed owner/owner, and the value of such portion will be taken into account for evaluating the assets of the company. The value of such part of the property as is occupied by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda will be adjusted in the value of his share. 16. That for the purpose of valuation of share of Shri Narendra Nath Nanda Group, the property No.K-72, Udyog Nagar, Rohtak Road, Delhi will be treated as the property  Page 3 of 9 of the company. 19. This agreement will be filed in the Suit No.1310 of 1988 and C.P. No.28 of 1988, and appropriate orders will be passed in the suit"". Justice P.N. Khanna acting as the Commissioner allotted the Golf Links property to the group of appellant No.2 even though he found that appellant No.2 and his group were entitled to get assets worth Rs.1.10 crores whereas the value of the property was Rs.1.82 crores. However, since further disputes arose between the parties the matter came up before the Court and it was agreed by the parties that the valuation of the shares of Respondent No.1 \026 Company namely, Kidarsons Industries Private Ltd. and the immovable properties owned by the Company shall be done, and for this purpose the Court by its order of August 30, 1990 appointed M/s.

From this the valuers deducted 20% on account of provision restricting transfer of the shares of Respondent No.1 \026 Company. By this process, the value of each share was worked out to be Rs.733/-. Appellant No.2 filed his objections to the report of the Chartered Accountants which was dismissed by a learned Judge of the High Court by his Judgment and order dated February 5, 1993. Objections were raised such as those relating to valuation of goodwill, valuation of tenancy rights, valuation of Udyog Nagar plot, deduction from the value of the assets, provision for capital gains tax liability which may be payable on the hypothetical transfer of property, the deductions made from the value of the shares on account of restriction on transfer of the shares, and the question of allotment of a portion of the Golf Links property in favour of appellant No.2 Shri Narendra Nath Nanda in terms of Clause 14 of the settlement between the parties. In the instant appeal, we are only concerned with two issues namely, whether the portion of Golf Links property which at the time of settlement was occupied by Shri Narendra Nath Nanda be not allotted to him, and secondly, whether appropriate directions be given so that the appellants be made liable for payment of capital gains tax, if any, levied in future which levy shall be challenged by Respondent No.1 \026 Company, provided the funds are made available to it by the appellants for the purpose. At the threshold we may observe that the exercise undertaken by the High Court was with a view to give effect to the terms of settlement reached between the parties. It is trite that the terms of settlement reached between the parties shall ordinarily not be modified except with the consent of the parties. In the instant case, it has not been argued by anyone that the terms of settlement with which we are concerned are either illegal as being opposed to any statute or that it is hit by impossibility of performance and, therefore cannot be performed or that the settlement was not reached bona fide.

Having regard to these circumstances the learned Judges held that the interpretation placed on Clause 14 by the learned Single Judge was correct and the said property could not in any manner be given to Shri Narendra Nath Nanda. We may observe that before us counsel appearing on behalf of Shri Narendra Nath Nanda gave up his claim of allotment of the entire Golf Links property to him and submitted that he will be satisfied if the portion in his occupation on the date of settlement is allotted to him.

On the other hand, counsel for the respondent submitted that this was really a case of family settlement and the learned Judges have taken the broadest view of the matter with a view to give effect to the settlement reached between the parties. It is submitted that the over- all intention was to give respondent No.1 \026 Company to the contesting respondents and by compensating the appellants who are entitled to their 30.14% share in specie and the agency business of Thyssen.

It is submitted that a  Page 5 of 9 little ironing out of creases in family settlements must be permitted. It is therefore, submitted that the finding of the High Court on this aspect of the matter required no interference. Learned counsel for the respondents has brought to our notice a decision of the this Court in Kale and others vs. Deputy Director of Consolidation and others : (1976) 3 SCC 119 laying down the approach of the Court in giving effect to a bona fide family arrangement entered into between the parties with a view to resolving disputes once for all.

Where the courts find that the family arrangement suffers from a legal lacuna or a formal defect the rule of estoppel is pressed into service and is applied to shut out plea of the person who being a party to family arrangement seeks to unsettle a settled dispute and claims to revoke the family arrangement under which he has himself enjoyed some material benefits. The principles were concretized and succinctly reduced to the following propositions :  Page 6 of 9 ""(1) The family settlement must be a bona fide one so as to resolve family disputes and rival claims by a fair and equitable division or allotment of properties between the various members of the family; (2) The said settlement must be voluntary and should not be induced by fraud, coercion or undue influence; (3) The family arrangement may be even oral in which case no registration is necessary; (4) It is well settled that registration would be necessary only if the terms of the family arrangement are reduced into writing. Here also, a distinction should be made between a document containing the terms and recitals of a family arrangement made under the document and a mere memorandum prepared after the family arrangement had already been made either for the purpose of the record or for information of the Court for making necessary mutation. In such a case the memorandum itself does not create or extinguish any rights in immoveable properties and therefore does not fall within the mischief of Section 17(2) (sic) (Section 17(1)(b)?) of the Registration Act and is, therefore, not compulsorily registrable; (5) The members who may be parties to the family arrangement must have some antecedent title, claim or interest even a possible claim in the property which is acknowledged by the parties to the settlement. Even if one of the parties to the settlement has no title but under the arrangement the other party relinquishes all its claims or titles in favour of such a person and acknowledges him to be the sole owner, then the antecedent title must be assumed and the family arrangement will be upheld, and the Courts will find no difficulty in giving assent to the same; (6) Even if bona fide disputes, present or possible, which may not involve legal claims are settled by a bona fide family arrangement which is fair and equitable the family arrangement is final and binding on the parties to the settlement."" The aforesaid judgment of this Court refers to many other decisions to which we need not advert in this case but some of those decisions do take the view that a compromise or family arrangement is based on the assumption that there is an antecedent title of some sort in the parties and the agreement acknowledges and defines what that title is, each party relinquishing all claims to property other than that falling to his share and recognising the right of the others, as they had previously asserted it, to the portions allotted to them respectively. That explains why no conveyance is required in these cases to pass the title from the one in whom it resides to the person receiving it under the family arrangement. It is assumed that the title claimed by the person receiving the property under the arrangement had always resided in him or her so far as the property falling to his or her share is concerned and therefore no conveyance is necessary. We have made the above observations only because it has some relevance to the second issue which arises for our consideration in this appeal. It is true that the High Court has taken note of the practicalities of the situation and has proceeded on the basis that the appellants and the respondents cannot peacefully live in the same premises. The High Court has, therefore, not favoured allotment of a portion of the house in favour of appellant No.2 and has approved the allotment of the house to the respondents  Page 7 of 9 who owned the majority shares in the respondent No.1 \026 Company. This was done with a view to ensure that the parties live separately but in peace and harmony. We cannot find fault with the concern shown by the High Court, but the problem which arises in the instant case is that the High Court was not considering a matter in which it could have exercised its discretion to make allotment one way or the other as in a case of family partition. The decree of the Court is based upon a settlement reached between the parties. Even at the time when the settlement was reached the parties were well aware of the strained relationship which existed and the unfortunate events that occurred between the branch of appellant No.2 and the remaining members of the family. Despite this, it was agreed by all of them that the portion in occupation of appellant No.2 shall be allotted to him and the value thereof adjusted against his share. The respondents cannot now be heard to say that it would be inconvenient for them to reside with appellant No.2 and his family members in the same house, though in separate portions. The question as to how the parties will manage their affairs is a matter with which they only are primarily concerned and the Court cannot advise them in the matter. It may be that the architects may provide a solution for their problems, or it may be that in view of the circumstances one party may agree to sell its share or buy the share of the other party with a view to purchase peace, if that becomes necessary. These are matters in which the Court may have nothing to say. Clause 14 of the settlement being unambiguous, clear and categoric, it must be given effect because one cannot term the said Clause 14 as vitiated by fraud, or illegal being in breach of any statutory provision, or against public policy, or hit by the principle of impossibility of performance. The settlement was made bona fide by the parties to resolve all their disputes and all facts were known to the parties when they reached the settlement. With their eyes open and fully aware of their experiences of the past, they agreed to share the Golf Links property. The relevant clause in the settlement is not vitiated by any consideration which may impel the court not to give effect to that clause in the settlement. The question of practical inconvenience should have concerned the respondents when they entered into the settlement. They cannot at the stage of implementation of the settlement avoid a covenant in the settlement solemnly incorporated with their consent on the pretext of practical inconvenience of living in the same house, albeit in separate portions, in the unfortunate background of bickerings and acrimony. This issue must, therefore, be decided in favour of the appellants. The next question is whether the judgment of the High Court could be suitably modified to provide for challenge by respondent -Company to any order that may be passed in future by the tax authority imposing capital gains tax on the hypothetical transfers made under the settlement. We find from the judgment of the High Court that the matter was discussed at length and the Court was of the view, prima facie, that the transfers may attract capital gains tax. There was, therefore, justification for deduction of the anticipated capital gains tax liability from the total value of assets. Before us learned counsel for the respondent did not want to join issue on this question and left it to us to pass an appropriate order. Learned counsel for the appellants argued before us that no capital gains tax is payable in the instant case because the transfers are by virtue of an order of the Court and, therefore, Sections 100 to 104 of the Companies Act are attracted. There is in reality no transfer or sale that may attract capital gains  Page 8 of 9 tax, in view of the pre-existing right and title of the parties which gets crystalised under a family arrangement. He further submitted that so far as respondent - Company is concerned it does not get any consideration and, therefore, there is no question of any capital gains tax liability so far as respondent \026 Company is concerned. In any event even if the capital gains tax liability is imposed that will be the liability of the appellants herein, and they will be obliged to discharge that liability in accordance with law. Learned counsel for the appellant made a clear and categoric statement before us that if any liability arises out of the valuation of the assets or capital gains relating to properties covered by the settlement, the appellants shall be liable to discharge that liability. The appellants are willing to execute an undertaking to this effect and to creating a charge on the assets which may fall to their share for discharge of such tax liability, if any, imposed. It was submitted that there was no need to deduct this amount from the value of the assets of the Company and this Court may direct that in case such a liability arises in future and any demand is raised against respondent \026 Company of capital gains tax, the appellants shall be liable to discharge that liability. Respondent No.1 shall be entitled to challenge the tax demand, if any, for which necessary funds will be made available by the appellants. All this has been stated on the assumption that on a future date there is a demand of capital gains tax by the tax authority on the alleged transfers made under the settlement. We are of the view that since no demand of capital gains tax has been made so far, if any such demand is made in future in respect of the transfer of assets under the settlement for which 20% has been deducted by the Chartered Accountants, the respondent \026 Company shall challenge the demand provided the appellants shall place at its disposal necessary funds for the purpose. In any event the liability under the head ""capital gains"", if any, shall be that of the appellants who shall furnish an undertaking to this effect accepting their liability, and create a charge over the aforesaid assets to secure payment of capital gains tax, if any, imposed in future. Subject to this being done, there shall be no deduction from the value of the assets of the company of the anticipated liability of capital gains. below:- We, therefore, allow this appeal to the extent indicated a) that the judgment and order of the High Court is modified to the extent that appellant No.2, namely \026 Shri Narendra Nath Nanda shall be allotted the portion of the Golf Links house which was in his occupation on the date of settlement, and the value thereof shall be adjusted against his share. If something remains to be paid even after adjustment, the appellants shall pay such amount within a period of two months from the date of the order of the High Court. b) That no deduction shall be made from the value of the assets of the anticipated capital gains tax liability on the hypothetical sale under the settlement. In case a demand of capital gains tax is made by the tax authority in future against respondent \026 Company, the aforesaid Company shall be entitled to challenge the imposition of such tax subject to appellant No.2 providing sufficient funds to the respondent \026 Company for this purpose. In any event, the capital gains tax, if found payable, shall be the liability of the appellants to be discharged by them. They shall  Page 9 of 9 furnish an undertaking before the High Court accepting such liability, and shall execute a document creating a charge on the assets allocated to them under the settlement to discharge capital gains tax liability, if found payable. The matter is remitted to the High Court for giving effect to the aforesaid modifications which may involve directing the Chartered Accountants to make a re-calculation on the basis of the directions contained in this judgment, and apportion the assets accordingly. This appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above. Parties to bear their own costs. WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO.1705 OF 1999 Hansa Industries Pvt.

However, none of the boxes bore the box number. Accused-appellant had applied for renewal of licence from time to time and as such transaction of supply of safety fuse wire by Gopal Modi to the accused-appellant was in contravention of the provisions of Explosive Act. The accused-appellant had no licence to deal with gelatine or detonators and as such the transactions.to this effect were illegal and were to aid and abet the terrorist activities. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat had no licence to deal with gelatine or detonators but he had indulged, in such transaction pursuance to the criminal conspiracy as detailed above. He was having license to deal in gunpowder and 3 cases of safety fuses only. As regards detonators, in all 5200 special ordinary detonators and 500 electric detonators were recovered from the residence of accused-appellant and 11000 ordinary special detonators were recovered from the godown of T.C.I. Chikamberpur U.P. Ghaziabad border which was a part of the consignment booked on 14.11.1990 by the accused-appellant for transportation to Srinagar. These ordinary special detonators were manufactured by I.D.L. Chemicals Limited, Hyderabad and the remaining 500 electric detonators were manufactured by R.E.C.L., Dholpur. The batch number was not given on any of the packets of detonators. The 11000 ordinary special detonators recovered from T.C.I, godown Chikamberpur U.P. Ghaziabad border were supplied by the accused Kuldip Jain, proprietor of M/s. Bharat Explosives and Chemicals, Jaipur, to the accused-appellant of M/s Jaipur Acid Supply company, Jaipur. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat was engaged in abetting the terrorist activities in J and k and used to procure explosives from the co-accused as preparatory acts for the terrorist activities. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat used to take the delivery of the consignments so booked by the accused appellant of M/s Jaipur Acid Supply Company, Jaipur, through the branch office of T.C.I, and Economic Transport Organization. According to prosecution the above facts and circumstances of the case clearly establish that the accused Mohd. Ismail Bhatt, accused-appellant, Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain have committed offences punishable under Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short tha ’IPC’) read with Sections 3(1), 5 and 6 of TADA Act, Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act and Section 3(3) and 6 of TADA Act, Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act. Accused Krishna Gopal Soni has Committed offence punishable u/s. 9-B of the Act. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat was absconding and was declared absconder on 25.2.1994. By order of the Designated Court on 1.2.1996, the accused persons facing trial were discharged in respect of offences under Sections 3(3), 4, 6 of TADA Act and accused Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain were discharged in respect of offence’ under Section 5 of the TADA Act. Accused Krishna Gopal Soni was discharged in respect of offence under Section 9-B of Act. Thus, the case of co-accused Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain was transferred to the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jaipur under Section 18 of the TADA Act for trial of the offences relatable to Sections 6 and 9-B of the Act. Prosecution examined 43 witnesses to further its version. Accused appellant pleaded innocence and took a stand that he had a licence for his business, he has not present during search of his house and godowns, and gelatine and detonators were not seized from his premises. Since he had applied for renewal of his licence and there was no  Page 5 of 7 letter of cancellation, it is presumed that nothing illegal has been committed by him and he was falsely implicated. Learned trial Judge found the accused guilty for offences punishable under Section 5 of the TADA Act, Sections 4 and 5 of the Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act, after considering the evidence. He was sentenced to undergo five years imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000 with default stipulation in relation to Section 5 of the TADA Act, Similar custodial sentence was imposed for the offence under the Explosive Act and the Act and a fine of Rs. 5,000 for the offence under the Explosive Act and Rs. 3,000 under the Act default stipulation. The conviction was based on following incriminating circumstances: (1) recovery of gelatine and detonators from the room above the godown; (2) sale of articles to absconding accused which were seized at the U.P. Ghaziabad border when being taken back to Jaipur. The articles were kept in the godown of the two accused who were facing trial separately and, (3) the confessional statement was recorded before the Superintendent of Police strictly in accordance with law, and that was sufficient for finding the accused guilty with the aforesaid findings, the conclusions of guilt and award of sentence were done. In support of the appeal, it was submitted that conscious possession which is sine qua non for establishing the accusations has not been proved. It was clear from the evidence that the room from where the contraband articles were seized was easily accessible. Even the witnesses have not consistently said that the room and the almirah from where the articles were allegedly kept were not locked. The Explosives Controller’s report is not very clear. There is also no material to show where the articles were kept during the date of seizure and the date of report. Some of the witnesses have not specifically said about seizure of the articles. Section 5 refers to possession ""in present"". Even if it is held that at some point of time possession was there, and same was pursuant to any conspiracy, that cannot stick to the appellant as there was no charge under Section 120B of the IPC. The confessional statement was recorded without granting proper time for reflection. It is also submitted that the appellant is nearly 80 years of age and since accusations under the TADA Act have not been conclusively established and the appellant had already undergone custody for about 4 years, the sentence may be reduced to the period already undergone in case it is held that the accusations have been established. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the stand taken about conscious possession is clearly untenable because the room was part of the premises owned by the accused. There was not even any suggestion that somebody else had planted the articles. On the contrary, the suggestion was that one Chitarmal had kept the articles for safe custody. The confessional statement suffers from no legal infirmity and all requisite procedural safeguards have been taken. It is not the date of discovery which is relevant, and earlier possession subsequent to the date of notification is material. Merely because there has been a detection subsequently, it does not take away the rigor of Section 5. So far as the articles seized at the U.P. Ghaziabad border is concerned, a camouflage was made to take out the articles as if they are harmless chemicals. Appellant himself had admitted that he was previously having a licence to deal with explosives, but the licence was subsequently not renewed. Whether the almirah was locked or whether the room was locked or open does not make any difference when possession has been established. We shall first deal with the question relating to conscious possession. Whether there was conscious possession has to be determined with reference to the factual backdrop. The facts which can be culled out from the  Page 6 of 7 evidence on record is that the accused was owner of the premises. It has not even been remotely suggested that somebody else kept the articles, without his knowledge. It is highlighted that unless the possession was coupled with requisite mental element, i.e. conscious possession and not mere custody without awareness of the nature of such possession, Section 5 is not- attracted. The expression ’possession’ is polymorphous term which assumes .different colours in different contexts. It may carry different meanings in contextually different backgrounds. It is impossible, as was observed in Superintendent & Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Anil Kumar Bhunia and Ors., AIR (1980) SC 52, to work out a completely logical and precise definition of ""Possession"" uniformly applicable to all situations in the context of all statutes. The word ’conscious means awareness about a particular fact. It is a state of mind which is deliberate or intended. As noted in Gunwantlal v. The State of M.P., AIR (1972) SC 1756 possession in a given case need not be physical possession but can be constructive, having power and control over the article in case in question, while the person whom physical possession is given holds it subject to that power or control. The word ’possession’ means the legal right to possession (See Health v. Drown, [1972] 2 All Er 561 (HL). In an interesting case it was observed that where a person keeps his firearm in his mother’s flat which is safer than his own home, he must be considered to be in possession of the same. See Sullivan v. Earl of Caithness, [1976] 1 All ER 844 (QBD). Once possession is established the person who claims that it was not a conscious possession has to establish it, because how he came to be in possession is within his special knowledge. The factual scenario noticed by the trial Court is based on the evidence of PWs 2 and 5. The evidence of the Explosive Controller and the analysis made by him has been established. The Explosive Controller’s report shows that the seals were intact. In fact the suggestion given by the defence was that the goods were kept for safe custody by one Chitarmal. It strengthens the prosecution version rather than weakening it. Samples (Ext. 25) draw on 19.11.1990. It was found out that the articles were gelatine, electric detonator and detonator. There was an attempt to eraze the seals of the manufacturer on the seized containers. The Explosive Controller has indicated about the seals to be intact. In State of Tamil Nadu v. Sivarasan @ Raghu @ Sivarasa and Ors., [1997] 1 SCC 682 it was held that the prosecution must prove that the accused was in conscious possession unauthorisedly in a notified area of any specified arms and ammunition. The large quantities of the explosives and other contraband articles not only belies but militates against the very plea of the appellant relating to conscious possession. No further nexus with any terrorist or disruptive activity is required to be proved as a statutory presumption would arise that the said arm or explosive substance was meant to be used for a terrorist or disruptive act. Statements of Ramniwas (PW-7), Nand Singh (PW-5), Prabhu (PW-6) has been analysed in great detail. The Explosive Controller, Dr. S. Kamal was examined as PW-8. As rightly noticed by the trial Court in spite of lengthy cross examination, no crack has been noticed in their statements to discredit their testimony. It has been noticed by the trial Court that there was only one entrance towards the concerned room which was above the godown at the back of the house. It was not an open place as contended to which any one, without  Page 7 of 7 getting into the house itself, can gain entry. In Sivarasan’s case (supra) it was observed that gelatine goods were explosive substance within the meaning of Section 5 of the TADA Act. Since it is a complete article or device capable of exploding, ordinary detonator and electric detonators are also complete explosive substances within the purview of Section 5 of the TADA Act. Additionally, the ordinary detonator and electric detonator in huge quantity were seized. The possession of these articles in such large quantity by the accused has been proved and there is nothing to discard the prosecution version that the possession was conscious. Additionally, the confessional statement recorded by PW-4 does not suffer from any infirmity. Though it is desirable that sufficient time gap should be given to the declarant, in addition, to telling him that the statement could be used in law against him, there is no rigid formula as to what would be an adequate time. It would depend upon the circumstances of each case. On the facts of the present case, the time though was not very long, yet cannot be said to be too short to cast doubt on the voluntariness of the statement. At no point of time there was any challenge made that the statement which was produced in the Court in presence of the accused was not voluntary and/or was the result of coercion or undue influence or threat. In fact there was no denial of the fact that the statement was recorded. It has not been shown as to in what manner the accused has been prejudiced by non-granting of longer time. The statement recorded is very elaborate and the accused has inculpated himself with the details like the source of purchase of the articles which were within his personal and special knowledge. There is no reason to discard the evidence of PW-4, and The confessional statement. In S.N. Dube v. N.B. Bhoir and Ors., [2000] 2 SCC 254 it was held that neither Section 15 of the TADA Act nor rule 15 contemplates recording of confessional statement in two parts or giving time to the person making a confession to think over and re-consider whether he still wants to make the statement inspite of being told that he is not bound to make it and that it can be used against him. The ratio of this decision has full application to the facts of the present case. In view of these findings, it is not necessary to go into the other question whether the past transactions come within the umbrella of Section 5, though prima facie that appears to be the correct position. That being the position, the appeal is without merit and deserves dismissal, which we direct","JUDGMENT 2003 Supp(4) SCR 1 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. : Appellant was found guilty of offences punishable under Section 5 of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (in short the ""TADA Act""), Sections 4 and 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 (in short the ’Explosive Act’) and Section 9-B of Explosives Act, 1884 (in short the ’Act’) read with Rule 115 of Explosives Rules, 1983 (in short the ’Rules’).

Against the appellant, offences under Section 3, 4, 5 of Explosive Act, Section 9-B of the Act and Section 6 of the TADA Act were made out. On this written report, FIR No. 275/90 was lodged at police station Moti Dungri, Jaipur. Though charge sheet was filed after investigation Government of Rajasthan, with consent of the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pension (Department of Personnel and Training), Government of India, New Delhi entrusted the investigation of the case to Central Bureau of Investigation (in short the ’CBI’) vide Notification dated 28.10.1991.

However, none of the boxes bore the box number. Accused-appellant had applied for renewal of licence from time to time and as such transaction of supply of safety fuse wire by Gopal Modi to the accused-appellant was in contravention of the provisions of Explosive Act. The accused-appellant had no licence to deal with gelatine or detonators and as such the transactions.to this effect were illegal and were to aid and abet the terrorist activities. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat had no licence to deal with gelatine or detonators but he had indulged, in such transaction pursuance to the criminal conspiracy as detailed above. He was having license to deal in gunpowder and 3 cases of safety fuses only. As regards detonators, in all 5200 special ordinary detonators and 500 electric detonators were recovered from the residence of accused-appellant and 11000 ordinary special detonators were recovered from the godown of T.C.I. Chikamberpur U.P. Ghaziabad border which was a part of the consignment booked on 14.11.1990 by the accused-appellant for transportation to Srinagar. These ordinary special detonators were manufactured by I.D.L. Chemicals Limited, Hyderabad and the remaining 500 electric detonators were manufactured by R.E.C.L., Dholpur. The batch number was not given on any of the packets of detonators. The 11000 ordinary special detonators recovered from T.C.I, godown Chikamberpur U.P. Ghaziabad border were supplied by the accused Kuldip Jain, proprietor of M/s. Bharat Explosives and Chemicals, Jaipur, to the accused-appellant of M/s Jaipur Acid Supply company, Jaipur. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat was engaged in abetting the terrorist activities in J and k and used to procure explosives from the co-accused as preparatory acts for the terrorist activities. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat used to take the delivery of the consignments so booked by the accused appellant of M/s Jaipur Acid Supply Company, Jaipur, through the branch office of T.C.I, and Economic Transport Organization. According to prosecution the above facts and circumstances of the case clearly establish that the accused Mohd. Ismail Bhatt, accused-appellant, Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain have committed offences punishable under Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short tha ’IPC’) read with Sections 3(1), 5 and 6 of TADA Act, Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act and Section 3(3) and 6 of TADA Act, Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act. Accused Krishna Gopal Soni has Committed offence punishable u/s. 9-B of the Act. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat was absconding and was declared absconder on 25.2.1994. By order of the Designated Court on 1.2.1996, the accused persons facing trial were discharged in respect of offences under Sections 3(3), 4, 6 of TADA Act and accused Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain were discharged in respect of offence’ under Section 5 of the TADA Act. Accused Krishna Gopal Soni was discharged in respect of offence under Section 9-B of Act. Thus, the case of co-accused Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain was transferred to the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jaipur under Section 18 of the TADA Act for trial of the offences relatable to Sections 6 and 9-B of the Act. Prosecution examined 43 witnesses to further its version. Accused appellant pleaded innocence and took a stand that he had a licence for his business, he has not present during search of his house and godowns, and gelatine and detonators were not seized from his premises. Since he had applied for renewal of his licence and there was no  Page 5 of 7 letter of cancellation, it is presumed that nothing illegal has been committed by him and he was falsely implicated. Learned trial Judge found the accused guilty for offences punishable under Section 5 of the TADA Act, Sections 4 and 5 of the Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act, after considering the evidence. He was sentenced to undergo five years imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000 with default stipulation in relation to Section 5 of the TADA Act, Similar custodial sentence was imposed for the offence under the Explosive Act and the Act and a fine of Rs. 5,000 for the offence under the Explosive Act and Rs. 3,000 under the Act default stipulation. The conviction was based on following incriminating circumstances: (1) recovery of gelatine and detonators from the room above the godown; (2) sale of articles to absconding accused which were seized at the U.P. Ghaziabad border when being taken back to Jaipur. The articles were kept in the godown of the two accused who were facing trial separately and, (3) the confessional statement was recorded before the Superintendent of Police strictly in accordance with law, and that was sufficient for finding the accused guilty with the aforesaid findings, the conclusions of guilt and award of sentence were done. In support of the appeal, it was submitted that conscious possession which is sine qua non for establishing the accusations has not been proved. It was clear from the evidence that the room from where the contraband articles were seized was easily accessible. Even the witnesses have not consistently said that the room and the almirah from where the articles were allegedly kept were not locked. The Explosives Controller’s report is not very clear. There is also no material to show where the articles were kept during the date of seizure and the date of report. Some of the witnesses have not specifically said about seizure of the articles. Section 5 refers to possession ""in present"". Even if it is held that at some point of time possession was there, and same was pursuant to any conspiracy, that cannot stick to the appellant as there was no charge under Section 120B of the IPC. The confessional statement was recorded without granting proper time for reflection. It is also submitted that the appellant is nearly 80 years of age and since accusations under the TADA Act have not been conclusively established and the appellant had already undergone custody for about 4 years, the sentence may be reduced to the period already undergone in case it is held that the accusations have been established. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the stand taken about conscious possession is clearly untenable because the room was part of the premises owned by the accused. There was not even any suggestion that somebody else had planted the articles. On the contrary, the suggestion was that one Chitarmal had kept the articles for safe custody. The confessional statement suffers from no legal infirmity and all requisite procedural safeguards have been taken. It is not the date of discovery which is relevant, and earlier possession subsequent to the date of notification is material. Merely because there has been a detection subsequently, it does not take away the rigor of Section 5. So far as the articles seized at the U.P. Ghaziabad border is concerned, a camouflage was made to take out the articles as if they are harmless chemicals. Appellant himself had admitted that he was previously having a licence to deal with explosives, but the licence was subsequently not renewed. Whether the almirah was locked or whether the room was locked or open does not make any difference when possession has been established. We shall first deal with the question relating to conscious possession. Whether there was conscious possession has to be determined with reference to the factual backdrop. The facts which can be culled out from the  Page 6 of 7 evidence on record is that the accused was owner of the premises. It has not even been remotely suggested that somebody else kept the articles, without his knowledge. It is highlighted that unless the possession was coupled with requisite mental element, i.e. conscious possession and not mere custody without awareness of the nature of such possession, Section 5 is not- attracted. The expression ’possession’ is polymorphous term which assumes .different colours in different contexts. It may carry different meanings in contextually different backgrounds. It is impossible, as was observed in Superintendent & Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Anil Kumar Bhunia and Ors., AIR (1980) SC 52, to work out a completely logical and precise definition of ""Possession"" uniformly applicable to all situations in the context of all statutes. The word ’conscious means awareness about a particular fact. It is a state of mind which is deliberate or intended. As noted in Gunwantlal v. The State of M.P., AIR (1972) SC 1756 possession in a given case need not be physical possession but can be constructive, having power and control over the article in case in question, while the person whom physical possession is given holds it subject to that power or control. The word ’possession’ means the legal right to possession (See Health v. Drown, [1972] 2 All Er 561 (HL). In an interesting case it was observed that where a person keeps his firearm in his mother’s flat which is safer than his own home, he must be considered to be in possession of the same. See Sullivan v. Earl of Caithness, [1976] 1 All ER 844 (QBD). Once possession is established the person who claims that it was not a conscious possession has to establish it, because how he came to be in possession is within his special knowledge. The factual scenario noticed by the trial Court is based on the evidence of PWs 2 and 5. The evidence of the Explosive Controller and the analysis made by him has been established. The Explosive Controller’s report shows that the seals were intact. In fact the suggestion given by the defence was that the goods were kept for safe custody by one Chitarmal. It strengthens the prosecution version rather than weakening it. Samples (Ext. 25) draw on 19.11.1990. It was found out that the articles were gelatine, electric detonator and detonator. There was an attempt to eraze the seals of the manufacturer on the seized containers. The Explosive Controller has indicated about the seals to be intact. In State of Tamil Nadu v. Sivarasan @ Raghu @ Sivarasa and Ors., [1997] 1 SCC 682 it was held that the prosecution must prove that the accused was in conscious possession unauthorisedly in a notified area of any specified arms and ammunition. The large quantities of the explosives and other contraband articles not only belies but militates against the very plea of the appellant relating to conscious possession. No further nexus with any terrorist or disruptive activity is required to be proved as a statutory presumption would arise that the said arm or explosive substance was meant to be used for a terrorist or disruptive act. Statements of Ramniwas (PW-7), Nand Singh (PW-5), Prabhu (PW-6) has been analysed in great detail. The Explosive Controller, Dr. S. Kamal was examined as PW-8. As rightly noticed by the trial Court in spite of lengthy cross examination, no crack has been noticed in their statements to discredit their testimony. It has been noticed by the trial Court that there was only one entrance towards the concerned room which was above the godown at the back of the house. It was not an open place as contended to which any one, without  Page 7 of 7 getting into the house itself, can gain entry. In Sivarasan’s case (supra) it was observed that gelatine goods were explosive substance within the meaning of Section 5 of the TADA Act. Since it is a complete article or device capable of exploding, ordinary detonator and electric detonators are also complete explosive substances within the purview of Section 5 of the TADA Act. Additionally, the ordinary detonator and electric detonator in huge quantity were seized. The possession of these articles in such large quantity by the accused has been proved and there is nothing to discard the prosecution version that the possession was conscious. Additionally, the confessional statement recorded by PW-4 does not suffer from any infirmity. Though it is desirable that sufficient time gap should be given to the declarant, in addition, to telling him that the statement could be used in law against him, there is no rigid formula as to what would be an adequate time. It would depend upon the circumstances of each case. On the facts of the present case, the time though was not very long, yet cannot be said to be too short to cast doubt on the voluntariness of the statement. At no point of time there was any challenge made that the statement which was produced in the Court in presence of the accused was not voluntary and/or was the result of coercion or undue influence or threat. In fact there was no denial of the fact that the statement was recorded. It has not been shown as to in what manner the accused has been prejudiced by non-granting of longer time. The statement recorded is very elaborate and the accused has inculpated himself with the details like the source of purchase of the articles which were within his personal and special knowledge. There is no reason to discard the evidence of PW-4, and The confessional statement. In S.N. Dube v. N.B. Bhoir and Ors., [2000] 2 SCC 254 it was held that neither Section 15 of the TADA Act nor rule 15 contemplates recording of confessional statement in two parts or giving time to the person making a confession to think over and re-consider whether he still wants to make the statement inspite of being told that he is not bound to make it and that it can be used against him. The ratio of this decision has full application to the facts of the present case. In view of these findings, it is not necessary to go into the other question whether the past transactions come within the umbrella of Section 5, though prima facie that appears to be the correct position. That being the position, the appeal is without merit and deserves dismissal, which we direct"
22,Appeal (crl.) 865 of 2003,State of A.P.,S. Janardhana Rao,17/11/2004,B.N.AGRAWAL & A.K.MATHUR,"J U D G M E N T WITH CRIMINAL MISCELLANEOUS PETITION NO. 2569 OF 2004 B.N.AGRAWAL, J. Initially four persons, namely, S.Janardhana Rao (A-1), Mohammed Omar Bin Moin (A-2), S. Indira (A-3) and S.Prasanth (A-4) were made accused, but as A-2 turned to be an approver, pardon was granted to him and he was examined as PW-21. Thus, trial proceeded against the remaining three accused persons and the learned Special Judge upon the conclusion of trial acquitted A-3 and A-4 whereas convicted A-1 under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three years and to pay a fine of Rs. 3,000/-; in default to suffer simple imprisonment for a period of two months on each count. The sentences, however, were ordered to run concurrently. Against the order of conviction, A-1 preferred an appeal before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh whereas the State preferred an appeal against the order of acquittal of A-3 and A-4 and the High Court dismissed the State appeal whereas allowed the appeal filed by A-1 and acquitted him of all the charges. The State of Andhra Pradesh filed two petitions for grant of Special Leave to appeal; one against the order whereby the High Court dismissed appeal filed by the State against the order of acquittal of A-3 and A-4 by the trial court, which SLP was dismissed; and the second against the order whereby the High Court acquitted A-1 of all the charges in which leave was granted. The prosecution case, in short, was that A-1 was the member of Andhra Pradesh Higher Judicial Service and posted as IIIrd Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Hyderabad, at the relevant time and residing in Flat No. 402 of Garudagagan Apartments, Padmaraonagar, Secunderabad, A-3 was his wife, who was working as a teacher in Government New High School, Kotteru, Hanumakonda, and A-4 was their 19 years’ old son, who was deaf and dumb by birth. A-2 was a police constable attached to the court of A-1. Before A-1, Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989 was pending trial in which besides others, Sant Esher Singh (PW-1) and Rajinder Singh (PW-2) were accused. As the trial of the said case was at its final stage, A-1 is alleged to have sent message through PW-21 to PWs 1 and 2 demanding a sum of Rs. 6 lacs as illegal gratification for recording their acquittal in the said case, but ultimately the amount was reduced by A-1 to Rs. 3 lacs. As PWs 1 and 2 were not agreeable to pay even the reduced amount, PW 1 approached the officials of Anti Corruption Branch (hereinafter referred to as ’ACB’) for conducting a trap, but as it was a case in which a judicial officer was involved, they expressed their inability to do anything without any order from the High Court. Thereafter, on 3rd and 4th September, 1996, PW-1 met the learned Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh High Court and permission was granted by the High Court to conduct trap and register case.   of 6 Thereupon, PW-1 went to the office of ACB with Rs. 3 lacs which was kept in a plastic cover and gave it to S.Sreeramulu (PW-3) whose services were secured by R. Suryanarayana, Deputy Superintendent of Police, ACB, (PW-23). PW-23 noted down the numbers of all the currency notes which were in the denomination of Rs. 500/- in six bundles, on a separate sheet of paper. One of the officials of ACB treated the currency notes with the layer of phenolphthalein powder. Thereupon, officials of ACB organized a trap and they went to the court of A-1 on 4th September, 1996 which was a date fixed in the case where A-1 pronounced in open court the code word that ""all the matters will be adjourned to 6th September, 1996"" which could be taken as confirmation that PW-21 approached PWs 1 and 2 on his behalf and the work would be done. Then, on the same day, PWs 1 and 21 along with the trap party went to the house of A-1 at Hanumakonda in which his wife and son were residing. While members of the trap party were waiting at some distance from the house, PWs 1 and 21 went to the said house and as it was bolted from inside, PW-21 pressed the call bell whereupon wife of A-1 opened the door and both PWs 1 and 21 went inside the house where son of A-1 was also present. When PW-21 tried to hand over the plastic cover containing sum of Rs. 3 lacs, wife of A-1 asked him to count the money in her presence and after the same was counted, as directed by her, PW-21 kept the plastic cover containing the aforesaid amount on the teapoy which was shifted by her son to the cup-board in the same room. Thereafter, PWs 1 and 21 came out from the house and gave pre-arranged signal to the members of the trap party consisting of G.Bal Reddy (PW-22), PW-23 and the mediator (PW.3) who entered the house, met wife of A-1 and asked her about the receipt of the sum of Rs. 3 lacs, which she denied. Thereafter, son of A-1, who was deaf and dumb, led the members of the trap party to the bathroom attached to the master bedroom by making gestures and signs; and removed the lid of the flush tank where plastic bag containing sum of Rs. 3 lacs was found in water, photograph of which was taken, and after the same was taken out therefrom, the numbers of the currency notes, contained in the plastic bag, were compared and the same tallied with the numbers already noted down by PW-23 on a separate sheet of paper. After seizure of the aforesaid sum of Rs. 3 lacs, PW-21 informed A-1 about the payment of the said sum of Rs. 3 lacs to his wife and A-1 fixed up time to meet PW-1. According to pre-arranged programme, PWs 1 and 21 went to the flat of A-1 in the Apartment at Secunderabad in the night between 4th and 5th September, 1996 at 1.00 O’clock. After some time, PW 21 came out and remained outside the apartment. In the meantime, according to pre-arranged plan, the officials of ACB came there, entered the flat of A-1 and found that A-1 was entertaining PW-1. Stating the aforesaid facts, a first information report was lodged for prosecution of A-1, his wife (A-3), his son (A-4) besides PW-21 and investigation proceeded, on completion whereof chargesheet was submitted against all the aforesaid four accused persons after obtaining the required sanction. On receipt of the chargesheet, cognizance was taken. Defence of the accused persons was that they were innocent, no occurrence as alleged had taken place and they were falsely implicated in the present case at the instance of M.E.N.Patrudu (PW-20), the then Registrar (Vigilance) of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, who was also member of Andhra Pradesh Higher Judicial Service. During trial, as A-2 was granted pardon, the trial proceeded against the remaining three accused persons, as stated above. During trial, the prosecution examined several witnesses and got exhibited various documents. Upon conclusion of trial, the learned Special Judge acquitted A-3 and A-4, wife and son respectively of A-1, but convicted A-1, as stated above, whereupon two appeals were filed, one by the State against the acquittal of A-3 and A-4 and the other by A-1 challenging his conviction before the High Court. The appeal filed by the State was dismissed whereas the one filed by A-1 was allowed and he was acquitted of all the charges whereupon two Special Leave Petitions were filed before this Court. The Special Leave Petition filed against the order of the High Court confirming acquittal of wife and son of A-1 was dismissed whereas leave was granted against the order of acquittal of A-1 rendered by the High Court. Hence, this appeal in which an application was filed by M.E.N.Patrudu (PW-20), the then Registrar (Vigilance) of Andhra Pradesh High Court, which gave rise to  Page 3 of 6 Criminal Misc. Petition No. 2569 of 2004 for expunging the adverse remarks recorded by the High Court against PW-20 in the impugned order of acquittal of A-1 which was directed to be considered at the time of hearing of the appeal. In order to prove its case against A-1, who is respondent herein, the prosecution has relied upon the following circumstances: (i) A-1 demanded a sum of Rs. 6 lacs by way of illegal gratification which was later reduced to Rs. 3 lacs for showing official favour to PWs 1 and 2, who were accused in Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989 which was pending trial in his court and the said demand was made through PW-21. (ii) PW-1 met the learned Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh High Court and obtained permission of the High Court for trap and registering a case. (iii) On 4th September, 1996, which was the date fixed In Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989, A-1 pronounced the code word that ""all the petitions posted to that date stand adjourned to 6th September, 1996"" to assure PW-1 that the amount was demanded on his behalf by PW-21 and to go ahead with modalities worked out earlier, i.e., to pay the amount of Rs. 3 lacs in the denomination of Rs. 500/- notes to his wife in his Hanumakonda house. (iv) The amount of Rs. 3 lacs was paid to the wife of A-1 on 4th September, 1996 at his Hanumakonda house and the same was recovered by the trap party at the instance of son of A-1 from the flush tank of bathroom attached to the master bedroom of his house. (v) After payment of illegal gratification to the wife of A-1, PW-21 informed A-1 about the same on phone and fixed time with him to meet PW-1 and A-1 was found meeting and entertaining PW-1 in his flat at Garudagagan Apartments at Secunderabad in the night between 4th and 5th September, 1996 at 1.00 O’clock. To prove the first circumstance, prosecution has led the evidence of PWs 1, 2 and 21. PW-21 who was an approver, stated that he was a constable attached to the court of A-1 and one day, in the month of June, 1996, A-1 called him in his chambers and asked him to secure a driving licence for one of his relatives which work was done, as such, he became familiar to A-1. Thereafter, A-1 called him at his house and asked him to contact PWs 1 and 2, who were accused in Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989, for payment of illegal gratification to the tune of Rs. 6 lacs to A-1 whereupon those accused persons would be acquitted. The witness further stated that as he was afraid of PW-1, he met PW -2 on 20th August, 1996 and conveyed the message of A-1 to him and on his advise, met PW-1 on 24th August, 1996 and communicated the message to him as well, who wanted some time to consult PW-2. Five or six days thereafter, he again met PW-1 who expressed that he and PW 2 were in a position to pay only a sum of Rs. 3 lacs and the said information was passed on by PW 21 to A-1 who asked him to settle the deal for the said sum. PW-21 further stated that thereupon he informed PW-1 that A-1 was ready to accept sum of Rs. 3 lacs for recording acquittal of PWs 1 and 2. Thereupon, as PW-1 appeared to be in doubt whether the amount was actually demanded by A-1, PW-21 stated that it would be confirmed on 4th September, 1996 which was the date fixed in the said sessions case on which day in open court A-1 will announce ""that all the matters will be adjourned to 6th September, 1996"", which could be taken as code word to indicate that PW-21 approached PW-1 on behalf of A-1 and the amount of Rs. 3 lacs should be paid to the wife of A-1 at his Hanumakonda house. The statement of PW-21 has been corroborated in all material particulars by PWs 1 and 2 and the trial court after a detailed discussion placed reliance upon their evidence and the High Court was not justified in disbelieving their evidence on the basis of certain minor contradictions in their evidence. In our view, the prosecution has succeeded in proving this circumstance by credible evidence. In order to prove the second circumstance, the prosecution has examined PW-1, Khaja Pasha (PW 15), PWs 20 and 23. PW-1 stated that upon the receipt of message of A-1 through PW-21, he informed ACB officials who refused to take any action on the ground that permission of the High Court was required as A-1  Page 4 of 6 was a member of Andhra Pradesh Higher Judicial Service. Then on 3rd September, 1996, PW 1 could telephonically talk to PW-15, Private Secretary to the learned Chief Justice, Andhra Pradesh High Court, and appointment was fixed to meet the learned Chief Justice at 8.00 p.m. on that day. PW-15 further advised PW-1 to bring a written representation. Thereupon PW-1 went to the residence of the learned Chief Justice along with written representation (Ex.P-1) and gave the same to PW-15 in a sealed cover. After some time, he was called by the learned Chief Justice who asked PW-1 as to whether the contents of Ex.P-1 were true and correct and warned him that in case the same were found to be false, action would be taken against him. He further stated that he was asked by the learned Chief Justice to come again on the next day in the morning and accordingly this witness again went to the residence of the learned Chief Justice on 4th September, 1996 at 7.30 a.m. At that time, the Director General, ACB, the Joint Director, ACB, the Deputy Superintendent of Police, ACB, (PW.23) were already present at the house of the learned Chief Justice besides PW-20, the then Registrar (Vigilance) of the Andhra Pradesh High Court and he was informed by the learned Chief Justice that the Joint Director, ACB, will take care of the case under the guidance of Director General, ACB, whereupon PW-1 presented complaint before the Joint Director, ACB, on the same day. The aforesaid statement of PW-1 has been corroborated by PW-15, Private Secretary to the learned Chief Justice, Andhra Pradesh High Court, and PW-20- the then Registrar (Vigilance) and PW-23, who is said to have written a letter on 4th September, 1996 to the Director, ACB, to conduct a trap and register case against A-1. PW-23 has also supported the statement of PW-1. The statements of these witnesses are consistent with each other and have been relied upon by the trial court, but the High Court was not justified in refusing to place reliance upon them as there were certain minor discrepancies therein Thus, we find that the prosecution has proved this circumstance as well. To prove the third circumstance, the prosecution has led the evidence of PW-1, M.Ramakrishna Rao (PW-8), Milan Gokele (PW-9), T. Harikrishna (PW-12) and PW-21. PW-1 stated that on 4th September, 1996, he was present in the court room when A-1 announced the code word by saying that ""all the matters stand adjourned to 6th September, 1996"". The statement of PW-1 has been supported by PW-8 who was a special public prosecutor conducting Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989 who has categorically stated in his evidence that after luncheon recess when the case was taken up, A-1, who was the Presiding Officer, stated in open court that ""all the matters stand adjourned to 6th September, 1996"" but on the representation made by PW-9, the defence counsel, the case was adjourned to 9th September, 1996 as 6th September, 1996 was not convenient to PW-9. PW-9, the defence counsel, corroborated the statement of PW-8. He further stated that as 6th September, 1996 was not a date convenient to him, the matter was adjourned to 9th September, 1996 on his representation. PW-12, Inspector of Police, ACB, stated that he was deputed to attend the court on 4th September, 1996 to observe the proceedings in Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989 and on that day in his presence, A-1 announced in open court that ""all the matters stand adjourned to 6th September, 1996"". PW-21 stated that though on that day he had also gone to the court, he did not go inside the court hall, but was standing outside the court hall and after the case was adjourned, PW-1 came out from the court hall and informed this witness that A-1 announced code word in open court by saying that ""all the matters stand adjourned to 6th September, 1996"". From a bare perusal of the evidence of these witnesses, it would be clear that their evidence is consistent with each other and there is no contradiction therein on any material point. We find that the trial court was justified in relying upon their evidence to prove the circumstance and the High Court was wholly unjustified in doubting the veracity of their statements on the basis of minor contradictions in their evidence. In order to prove the fourth circumstance, the prosecution adduced the evidence of PWs 1, 3, 21, 22 and 23. PW-1 stated that on 4th September, 1996, he went to ACB office with the sum of Rs. 3 lacs kept in a plastic cover and handed over the same to the Dy. Superintendent of Police, ACB (PW-23) and his statement has been corroborated by PWs 3, 22 and 23. These witnesses have further stated that phenolphthalein powder was applied to the currency notes. It was arranged that PWs 1 and 21 would go inside the house of A-1 at  Page 5 of 6 Hanumakonda and after paying the sum of Rs. 3 lacs to his wife, they would come out from the house and PW 1 would give signal to the trap party by wiping his face with handkerchief and thereupon the trap party would go inside the house. PW-1 stated that according to pre-arranged plan, while the trap party was waiting outside the house at some distance, he and PW-21 went inside the house of A-1 at Hanumakonda which was bolted from inside and on the call bell being pressed by PW-21, wife of A-1 opened the door and on being told by PW 21 that they were sent by A-1, she stated that she had already received a message from A-1 and was waiting for them. The witness further stated that PW-21 was asked by wife of A-1 to count the money which was in plastic cover and thereafter to keep the same on teapoy pursuant to which PW-21 after counting kept the plastic cover containing the sum of Rs. 3 lacs on the teapoy. Wife of A-1 asked her son to keep the said plastic cover in the cup-board. Whereafter PWs 1 and 21 came out from the house and according to the pre arranged plan, signal was given to the members of the trap party who arrived there and were taken inside the house by PWs 1 and 21. PWs 3, 22 and 23, who were members of the trap party, stated that on receiving pre-arranged signal from PW-1, they, along with PWs 1 and 21, entered the house of A-1 after his wife opened the door and they disclosed their identity. On being asked by the trap party, she denied any knowledge about the sum of Rs. 3 lacs. These witnesses further stated that son of A-1, who was deaf and dumb, made gestures and signs and took them to the bath room attached to the master bedroom and opened the lid of the flush tank in which plastic cover containing sum of Rs. 3 lacs was found and the same was taken out by PW-3 on the instructions of DSP, ACB (PW 23). After opening the cover, the numbers of currency notes were compared and the same tallied with the numbers noted down separately on a sheet of paper by the members of the trap party. The trap party thereafter seized the amount of Rs. 3 lacs and prepared mazhar for the same. Members of the trap party also took photograph of the plastic cover containing sum of Rs. 3 lacs before the same was taken out from the flush tank. The evidence of PWs 1 and 21 has been supported by PWs 3, 22 and 23, who were members of the trap party, and the trial court did not find any discrepancy in their evidence, but the High Court erroneously refused to place reliance upon their evidence merely because there were certain minor contradictions therein. In order to prove the last circumstance against the respondent (A-1), the prosecution examined PW-1, D.Subba Rao (PW 4), K. Ramesh (PW 6), Butchanna Goud (PW 7), K.Kumar (PW-18) and PWs 21 & 22. PW-21 stated that after the seizure, he along with members of the trap party left for Hyderabad and from the house of PW-7, he had a telephonic talk with A-1 and informed him about the payment of Rs. 3 lacs and fixed up time of the meeting of PW-1 with A-1. PW-21 further stated that according to pre-arranged programme, in the night between 4th and 5th September, 1996 at 1.00 o’clock, PWs 1 and 21 went to the flat of A-1, which was situated at Garudagagan Apartments, Secunderabad, and they were followed by PW-4 and PW-22. While PWs 1 and 21 were going to the flat of A-1, they met PW-6 who was the watchman. After meeting A-1, PW-1 stayed in the flat of A-1 while PW-21 came out and the door was bolted from inside. After some time, PWs 4, 18 and 22 came there and found that PW 21 was standing outside the flat. PW-1 in his evidence corroborated the aforesaid statements made by PW-21. PWs 4, 18 and 22 stated that on call bell being pressed, A-1 opened the door and they found that PW-1 who was accused in Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989 was being entertained in the house of A-1 at such an odd hour. PW-7 stated that PW-21 had a telephonic talk with A-1 from his house. PW-6, the watchman of Garudagagan Apartments stated that PWs 1, 4,18,21 and 22 came to the flat of A-1 during that night. The statements of PWs 1, 4,6,7,18,21 and 22 have been relied upon by the trial court to prove this circumstance against the respondent upon threadbare discussion of their evidence and the High Court was not justified in disbelieving the same on account of minor contradictions. Thus, we find that the prosecution has proved this circumstance as well by credible evidence. From the foregoing discussions, it would be clear that the prosecution has succeeded in proving its case beyond reasonable doubt, the trial court was quite justified in recording conviction of A-1 and the judgment of High Court acquitting him suffers from the vice of perversity as it has refused to place reliance upon  Page 6 of 6 the evidence of witnesses merely on the basis of certain minor contradictions in the evidence of witnesses, though, they have supported the prosecution case on all material particulars. In our opinion, the High Court was also not at all justified in making adverse remarks in the impugned judgment against PW-20, the then Registrar (Vigilance) of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which were wholly uncalled for and the same are accordingly liable to be expunged. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal as well as Criminal Misc. Petition No. 2569 of 2004 are allowed, the judgment of acquittal, rendered by the High Court so far the same relates to A-1, is set aside, the order of conviction of A-1 recorded by the trial court is restored and the adverse remarks, recorded in the impugned judgment against PW-20, are expunged. The respondent is directed to be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaining period of sentence.","J U D G M E N T WITH CRIMINAL MISCELLANEOUS PETITION NO. 2569 OF 2004 B.N.AGRAWAL, J. Initially four persons, namely, S.Janardhana Rao (A-1), Mohammed Omar Bin Moin (A-2), S. Indira (A-3) and S.Prasanth (A-4) were made accused, but as A-2 turned to be an approver, pardon was granted to him and he was examined as PW-21. Thus, trial proceeded against the remaining three accused persons and the learned Special Judge upon the conclusion of trial acquitted A-3 and A-4 whereas convicted A-1 under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three years and to pay a fine of Rs. 3,000/-; in default to suffer simple imprisonment for a period of two months on each count. The sentences, however, were ordered to run concurrently. Against the order of conviction, A-1 preferred an appeal before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh whereas the State preferred an appeal against the order of acquittal of A-3 and A-4 and the High Court dismissed the State appeal whereas allowed the appeal filed by A-1 and acquitted him of all the charges. The State of Andhra Pradesh filed two petitions for grant of Special Leave to appeal; one against the order whereby the High Court dismissed appeal filed by the State against the order of acquittal of A-3 and A-4 by the trial court, which SLP was dismissed; and the second against the order whereby the High Court acquitted A-1 of all the charges in which leave was granted. The prosecution case, in short, was that A-1 was the member of Andhra Pradesh Higher Judicial Service and posted as IIIrd Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Hyderabad, at the relevant time and residing in Flat No. 402 of Garudagagan Apartments, Padmaraonagar, Secunderabad, A-3 was his wife, who was working as a teacher in Government New High School, Kotteru, Hanumakonda, and A-4 was their 19 years’ old son, who was deaf and dumb by birth. A-2 was a police constable attached to the court of A-1. Before A-1, Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989 was pending trial in which besides others, Sant Esher Singh (PW-1) and Rajinder Singh (PW-2) were accused. As the trial of the said case was at its final stage, A-1 is alleged to have sent message through PW-21 to PWs 1 and 2 demanding a sum of Rs. 6 lacs as illegal gratification for recording their acquittal in the said case, but ultimately the amount was reduced by A-1 to Rs. 3 lacs. As PWs 1 and 2 were not agreeable to pay even the reduced amount, PW 1 approached the officials of Anti Corruption Branch (hereinafter referred to as ’ACB’) for conducting a trap, but as it was a case in which a judicial officer was involved, they expressed their inability to do anything without any order from the High Court. Thereafter, on 3rd and 4th September, 1996, PW-1 met the learned Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh High Court and permission was granted by the High Court to conduct trap and register case.   of 6 Thereupon, PW-1 went to the office of ACB with Rs. 3 lacs which was kept in a plastic cover and gave it to S.Sreeramulu (PW-3) whose services were secured by R. Suryanarayana, Deputy Superintendent of Police, ACB, (PW-23). PW-23 noted down the numbers of all the currency notes which were in the denomination of Rs. 500/- in six bundles, on a separate sheet of paper. One of the officials of ACB treated the currency notes with the layer of phenolphthalein powder. Thereupon, officials of ACB organized a trap and they went to the court of A-1 on 4th September, 1996 which was a date fixed in the case where A-1 pronounced in open court the code word that ""all the matters will be adjourned to 6th September, 1996"" which could be taken as confirmation that PW-21 approached PWs 1 and 2 on his behalf and the work would be done. Then, on the same day, PWs 1 and 21 along with the trap party went to the house of A-1 at Hanumakonda in which his wife and son were residing. While members of the trap party were waiting at some distance from the house, PWs 1 and 21 went to the said house and as it was bolted from inside, PW-21 pressed the call bell whereupon wife of A-1 opened the door and both PWs 1 and 21 went inside the house where son of A-1 was also present.

Thereafter, son of A-1, who was deaf and dumb, led the members of the trap party to the bathroom attached to the master bedroom by making gestures and signs; and removed the lid of the flush tank where plastic bag containing sum of Rs. 3 lacs was found in water, photograph of which was taken, and after the same was taken out therefrom, the numbers of the currency notes, contained in the plastic bag, were compared and the same tallied with the numbers already noted down by PW-23 on a separate sheet of paper. After seizure of the aforesaid sum of Rs. 3 lacs, PW-21 informed A-1 about the payment of the said sum of Rs. 3 lacs to his wife and A-1 fixed up time to meet PW-1. According to pre-arranged programme, PWs 1 and 21 went to the flat of A-1 in the Apartment at Secunderabad in the night between 4th and 5th September, 1996 at 1.00 O’clock. After some time, PW 21 came out and remained outside the apartment. In the meantime, according to pre-arranged plan, the officials of ACB came there, entered the flat of A-1 and found that A-1 was entertaining PW-1. Stating the aforesaid facts, a first information report was lodged for prosecution of A-1, his wife (A-3), his son (A-4) besides PW-21 and investigation proceeded, on completion whereof chargesheet was submitted against all the aforesaid four accused persons after obtaining the required sanction. On receipt of the chargesheet, cognizance was taken. Defence of the accused persons was that they were innocent, no occurrence as alleged had taken place and they were falsely implicated in the present case at the instance of M.E.N.Patrudu (PW-20), the then Registrar (Vigilance) of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, who was also member of Andhra Pradesh Higher Judicial Service. During trial, as A-2 was granted pardon, the trial proceeded against the remaining three accused persons, as stated above. During trial, the prosecution examined several witnesses and got exhibited various documents. Upon conclusion of trial, the learned Special Judge acquitted A-3 and A-4, wife and son respectively of A-1, but convicted A-1, as stated above, whereupon two appeals were filed, one by the State against the acquittal of A-3 and A-4 and the other by A-1 challenging his conviction before the High Court. The appeal filed by the State was dismissed whereas the one filed by A-1 was allowed and he was acquitted of all the charges whereupon two Special Leave Petitions were filed before this Court. The Special Leave Petition filed against the order of the High Court confirming acquittal of wife and son of A-1 was dismissed whereas leave was granted against the order of acquittal of A-1 rendered by the High Court. Hence, this appeal in which an application was filed by M.E.N.Patrudu (PW-20), the then Registrar (Vigilance) of Andhra Pradesh High Court, which gave rise to  Page 3 of 6 Criminal Misc. Petition No. 2569 of 2004 for expunging the adverse remarks recorded by the High Court against PW-20 in the impugned order of acquittal of A-1 which was directed to be considered at the time of hearing of the appeal. In order to prove its case against A-1, who is respondent herein, the prosecution has relied upon the following circumstances: (i) A-1 demanded a sum of Rs. 6 lacs by way of illegal gratification which was later reduced to Rs. 3 lacs for showing official favour to PWs 1 and 2, who were accused in Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989 which was pending trial in his court and the said demand was made through PW-21. (ii) PW-1 met the learned Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh High Court and obtained permission of the High Court for trap and registering a case. (iii) On 4th September, 1996, which was the date fixed In Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989, A-1 pronounced the code word that ""all the petitions posted to that date stand adjourned to 6th September, 1996"" to assure PW-1 that the amount was demanded on his behalf by PW-21 and to go ahead with modalities worked out earlier, i.e., to pay the amount of Rs. 3 lacs in the denomination of Rs. 500/- notes to his wife in his Hanumakonda house. (iv) The amount of Rs. 3 lacs was paid to the wife of A-1 on 4th September, 1996 at his Hanumakonda house and the same was recovered by the trap party at the instance of son of A-1 from the flush tank of bathroom attached to the master bedroom of his house. (v) After payment of illegal gratification to the wife of A-1, PW-21 informed A-1 about the same on phone and fixed time with him to meet PW-1 and A-1 was found meeting and entertaining PW-1 in his flat at Garudagagan Apartments at Secunderabad in the night between 4th and 5th September, 1996 at 1.00 O’clock. To prove the first circumstance, prosecution has led the evidence of PWs 1, 2 and 21. PW-21 who was an approver, stated that he was a constable attached to the court of A-1 and one day, in the month of June, 1996, A-1 called him in his chambers and asked him to secure a driving licence for one of his relatives which work was done, as such, he became familiar to A-1. Thereafter, A-1 called him at his house and asked him to contact PWs 1 and 2, who were accused in Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989, for payment of illegal gratification to the tune of Rs. 6 lacs to A-1 whereupon those accused persons would be acquitted. The witness further stated that as he was afraid of PW-1, he met PW -2 on 20th August, 1996 and conveyed the message of A-1 to him and on his advise, met PW-1 on 24th August, 1996 and communicated the message to him as well, who wanted some time to consult PW-2. Five or six days thereafter, he again met PW-1 who expressed that he and PW 2 were in a position to pay only a sum of Rs. 3 lacs and the said information was passed on by PW 21 to A-1 who asked him to settle the deal for the said sum. PW-21 further stated that thereupon he informed PW-1 that A-1 was ready to accept sum of Rs. 3 lacs for recording acquittal of PWs 1 and 2. Thereupon, as PW-1 appeared to be in doubt whether the amount was actually demanded by A-1, PW-21 stated that it would be confirmed on 4th September, 1996 which was the date fixed in the said sessions case on which day in open court A-1 will announce ""that all the matters will be adjourned to 6th September, 1996"", which could be taken as code word to indicate that PW-21 approached PW-1 on behalf of A-1 and the amount of Rs. 3 lacs should be paid to the wife of A-1 at his Hanumakonda house. The statement of PW-21 has been corroborated in all material particulars by PWs 1 and 2 and the trial court after a detailed discussion placed reliance upon their evidence and the High Court was not justified in disbelieving their evidence on the basis of certain minor contradictions in their evidence. In our view, the prosecution has succeeded in proving this circumstance by credible evidence. In order to prove the second circumstance, the prosecution has examined PW-1, Khaja Pasha (PW 15), PWs 20 and 23. PW-1 stated that upon the receipt of message of A-1 through PW-21, he informed ACB officials who refused to take any action on the ground that permission of the High Court was required as A-1  Page 4 of 6 was a member of Andhra Pradesh Higher Judicial Service. Then on 3rd September, 1996, PW 1 could telephonically talk to PW-15, Private Secretary to the learned Chief Justice, Andhra Pradesh High Court, and appointment was fixed to meet the learned Chief Justice at 8.00 p.m. on that day. PW-15 further advised PW-1 to bring a written representation. Thereupon PW-1 went to the residence of the learned Chief Justice along with written representation (Ex.P-1) and gave the same to PW-15 in a sealed cover. After some time, he was called by the learned Chief Justice who asked PW-1 as to whether the contents of Ex.P-1 were true and correct and warned him that in case the same were found to be false, action would be taken against him. He further stated that he was asked by the learned Chief Justice to come again on the next day in the morning and accordingly this witness again went to the residence of the learned Chief Justice on 4th September, 1996 at 7.30 a.m. At that time, the Director General, ACB, the Joint Director, ACB, the Deputy Superintendent of Police, ACB, (PW.23) were already present at the house of the learned Chief Justice besides PW-20, the then Registrar (Vigilance) of the Andhra Pradesh High Court and he was informed by the learned Chief Justice that the Joint Director, ACB, will take care of the case under the guidance of Director General, ACB, whereupon PW-1 presented complaint before the Joint Director, ACB, on the same day. The aforesaid statement of PW-1 has been corroborated by PW-15, Private Secretary to the learned Chief Justice, Andhra Pradesh High Court, and PW-20- the then Registrar (Vigilance) and PW-23, who is said to have written a letter on 4th September, 1996 to the Director, ACB, to conduct a trap and register case against A-1. PW-23 has also supported the statement of PW-1. The statements of these witnesses are consistent with each other and have been relied upon by the trial court, but the High Court was not justified in refusing to place reliance upon them as there were certain minor discrepancies therein Thus, we find that the prosecution has proved this circumstance as well. To prove the third circumstance, the prosecution has led the evidence of PW-1, M.Ramakrishna Rao (PW-8), Milan Gokele (PW-9), T. Harikrishna (PW-12) and PW-21. PW-1 stated that on 4th September, 1996, he was present in the court room when A-1 announced the code word by saying that ""all the matters stand adjourned to 6th September, 1996"". The statement of PW-1 has been supported by PW-8 who was a special public prosecutor conducting Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989 who has categorically stated in his evidence that after luncheon recess when the case was taken up, A-1, who was the Presiding Officer, stated in open court that ""all the matters stand adjourned to 6th September, 1996"" but on the representation made by PW-9, the defence counsel, the case was adjourned to 9th September, 1996 as 6th September, 1996 was not convenient to PW-9. PW-9, the defence counsel, corroborated the statement of PW-8. He further stated that as 6th September, 1996 was not a date convenient to him, the matter was adjourned to 9th September, 1996 on his representation. PW-12, Inspector of Police, ACB, stated that he was deputed to attend the court on 4th September, 1996 to observe the proceedings in Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989 and on that day in his presence, A-1 announced in open court that ""all the matters stand adjourned to 6th September, 1996"". PW-21 stated that though on that day he had also gone to the court, he did not go inside the court hall, but was standing outside the court hall and after the case was adjourned, PW-1 came out from the court hall and informed this witness that A-1 announced code word in open court by saying that ""all the matters stand adjourned to 6th September, 1996"". From a bare perusal of the evidence of these witnesses, it would be clear that their evidence is consistent with each other and there is no contradiction therein on any material point. We find that the trial court was justified in relying upon their evidence to prove the circumstance and the High Court was wholly unjustified in doubting the veracity of their statements on the basis of minor contradictions in their evidence. In order to prove the fourth circumstance, the prosecution adduced the evidence of PWs 1, 3, 21, 22 and 23. PW-1 stated that on 4th September, 1996, he went to ACB office with the sum of Rs. 3 lacs kept in a plastic cover and handed over the same to the Dy. Superintendent of Police, ACB (PW-23) and his statement has been corroborated by PWs 3, 22 and 23. These witnesses have further stated that phenolphthalein powder was applied to the currency notes. It was arranged that PWs 1 and 21 would go inside the house of A-1 at  Page 5 of 6 Hanumakonda and after paying the sum of Rs. 3 lacs to his wife, they would come out from the house and PW 1 would give signal to the trap party by wiping his face with handkerchief and thereupon the trap party would go inside the house. PW-1 stated that according to pre-arranged plan, while the trap party was waiting outside the house at some distance, he and PW-21 went inside the house of A-1 at Hanumakonda which was bolted from inside and on the call bell being pressed by PW-21, wife of A-1 opened the door and on being told by PW 21 that they were sent by A-1, she stated that she had already received a message from A-1 and was waiting for them. The witness further stated that PW-21 was asked by wife of A-1 to count the money which was in plastic cover and thereafter to keep the same on teapoy pursuant to which PW-21 after counting kept the plastic cover containing the sum of Rs. 3 lacs on the teapoy. Wife of A-1 asked her son to keep the said plastic cover in the cup-board. Whereafter PWs 1 and 21 came out from the house and according to the pre arranged plan, signal was given to the members of the trap party who arrived there and were taken inside the house by PWs 1 and 21. PWs 3, 22 and 23, who were members of the trap party, stated that on receiving pre-arranged signal from PW-1, they, along with PWs 1 and 21, entered the house of A-1 after his wife opened the door and they disclosed their identity. On being asked by the trap party, she denied any knowledge about the sum of Rs. 3 lacs. These witnesses further stated that son of A-1, who was deaf and dumb, made gestures and signs and took them to the bath room attached to the master bedroom and opened the lid of the flush tank in which plastic cover containing sum of Rs. 3 lacs was found and the same was taken out by PW-3 on the instructions of DSP, ACB (PW 23). After opening the cover, the numbers of currency notes were compared and the same tallied with the numbers noted down separately on a sheet of paper by the members of the trap party. The trap party thereafter seized the amount of Rs. 3 lacs and prepared mazhar for the same. Members of the trap party also took photograph of the plastic cover containing sum of Rs. 3 lacs before the same was taken out from the flush tank. The evidence of PWs 1 and 21 has been supported by PWs 3, 22 and 23, who were members of the trap party, and the trial court did not find any discrepancy in their evidence, but the High Court erroneously refused to place reliance upon their evidence merely because there were certain minor contradictions therein. In order to prove the last circumstance against the respondent (A-1), the prosecution examined PW-1, D.Subba Rao (PW 4), K. Ramesh (PW 6), Butchanna Goud (PW 7), K.Kumar (PW-18) and PWs 21 & 22. PW-21 stated that after the seizure, he along with members of the trap party left for Hyderabad and from the house of PW-7, he had a telephonic talk with A-1 and informed him about the payment of Rs. 3 lacs and fixed up time of the meeting of PW-1 with A-1. PW-21 further stated that according to pre-arranged programme, in the night between 4th and 5th September, 1996 at 1.00 o’clock, PWs 1 and 21 went to the flat of A-1, which was situated at Garudagagan Apartments, Secunderabad, and they were followed by PW-4 and PW-22. While PWs 1 and 21 were going to the flat of A-1, they met PW-6 who was the watchman. After meeting A-1, PW-1 stayed in the flat of A-1 while PW-21 came out and the door was bolted from inside. After some time, PWs 4, 18 and 22 came there and found that PW 21 was standing outside the flat. PW-1 in his evidence corroborated the aforesaid statements made by PW-21. PWs 4, 18 and 22 stated that on call bell being pressed, A-1 opened the door and they found that PW-1 who was accused in Sessions Case No. 186 of 1989 was being entertained in the house of A-1 at such an odd hour. PW-7 stated that PW-21 had a telephonic talk with A-1 from his house. PW-6, the watchman of Garudagagan Apartments stated that PWs 1, 4,18,21 and 22 came to the flat of A-1 during that night. The statements of PWs 1, 4,6,7,18,21 and 22 have been relied upon by the trial court to prove this circumstance against the respondent upon threadbare discussion of their evidence and the High Court was not justified in disbelieving the same on account of minor contradictions. Thus, we find that the prosecution has proved this circumstance as well by credible evidence. From the foregoing discussions, it would be clear that the prosecution has succeeded in proving its case beyond reasonable doubt, the trial court was quite justified in recording conviction of A-1 and the judgment of High Court acquitting him suffers from the vice of perversity as it has refused to place reliance upon  Page 6 of 6 the evidence of witnesses merely on the basis of certain minor contradictions in the evidence of witnesses, though, they have supported the prosecution case on all material particulars. In our opinion, the High Court was also not at all justified in making adverse remarks in the impugned judgment against PW-20, the then Registrar (Vigilance) of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which were wholly uncalled for and the same are accordingly liable to be expunged. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal as well as Criminal Misc. Petition No. 2569 of 2004 are allowed, the judgment of acquittal, rendered by the High Court so far the same relates to A-1, is set aside, the order of conviction of A-1 recorded by the trial court is restored and the adverse remarks, recorded in the impugned judgment against PW-20, are expunged. The respondent is directed to be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaining period of sentence."
23,Appeal (civil) 3698 of 2006,"Ganesh Bank, Kurundwad Ltd. and Ors.",The Union of India and Ors.,28/08/2006,ARIJIT PASAYAT & C.K. THAKKER,"J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (C) No. 7188 of 2006) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. The present appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 5.4.2006 passed by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No.337/2006 questioning Notification dated 7th January, 2006 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance imposing a moratorium in respect of the appellant-Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""Bank"") for a period of three months from the date of order upto and inclusive of 6th April, 2006. Amongst others, the said Bank was directed not to grant any loan or advances or incur liability without the permission in writing of the Reserve Bank of India (in short the ’RBI’’). Further, withdrawal of sums not exceeding 5,000/- by a Savings Bank or Current Account holder was permitted with a further relaxation of amount not exceeding Rs.10,000/- or the actual balance whichever is less in the event of certain difficulties such as medical treatment, higher education and obligatory expenses like marriage etc. Challenge was also made to the appointment of two Directors on the Board of Directors of the Bank. Further Challenge was made to the Notification dated 9.1.2006 proposing a scheme of amalgamation of the Bank with Federal Bank, another private sector commercial bank and to the order dated 24.1.2006 sanctioning amalgamation of Bank with Federal Bank. It is to be noted that along with the said writ petition filed by the Bank, another writ petition (WP(C) No. 160/2006) was filed by one Mr. Sunil Mahadev Chavan. The background facts in which the writ petitions were filed are essentially as follows: Appellant Bank was founded sometimes in the year 1920 and is having a banking license given by the RBI. It has some 32 branches situated principally in districts of Kolhapur and Sangli of Maharashtra and the adjoining Belgaum District of Karnataka. It has around 1,75,000 depositors in the rural   of 15 areas of these three districts. It was carrying on its activities smoothly, and it incurred losses only once and that was in the financial year 2004-05. That was also for the reasons which were beyond its control, viz (i) the value of the government securities, wherein it had made deposits, went down, and (ii) the provisioning norms set up by the RBI were made more stringent by it. It was on this background that it was shocked to receive the order of moratorium in the morning of 8th January, 2006. It led to unnecessary long queue at its Dadar branch, Mumbai, though there was no run on the bank any time in the past or even on that day as such. Thereafter, the issuance of the moratorium and the decision of the RBI to take further steps was duly advertised. The RBI appointed two directors of its own on the Board of Directors of the appellant-Bank on 7th January, 2006. The RBI then notified the proposed scheme of amalgamating the appellant-Bank with the Federal Bank on 9th January, 2006. The appellant-Bank objected to it by filing its objections on 23rd January, 2006, yet a decision was taken by the RBI and the Central Government on 24th January, 2006 sanctioning amalgamation of the appellant-Bank with the Federal Bank. An interim order was passed by the High Court in W.P.337/2006 by which operation of the order dated 24.6.2006 was stayed and status quo was directed to be maintained. The order was challenged by the RBI and Federal Bank before this Court. By Order dated 30.1.2006 this Court directed that the petitions were to be heard and decided early by the High Court. However, the interim order was left undisturbed. Before the High Court the principal submissions of the writ petitioners were two-fold, namely that the order dated 7th January, 2006 imposing moratorium and then the order dated 7th January, 2006 appointing two Directors are both mala fide to suit the convenience of Federal Bank, ultra vires the power of the RBI and the Central Government and, therefore, bad in law, illegal and void. Similarly, the other submission of the writ petitioners was that the subsequent framing of scheme of amalgamation on 9th January, 2006 and the decision to sanction the amalgamation taken on 24th January, 2006 are motivated and pre-planned decisions for the benefit of the Federal Bank, mala fide and ultra vires the powers of the Central Government and the RBI. It was further submitted that both these decisions are not justified on facts and have been arrived at without taking into consideration the relevant materials. As far as the first decision imposing the moratorium is concerned, it was submitted that there were no good reasons to impose the same and, as far as the decision to amalgamate is concerned, it was submitted that the said decision was arrived at without considering the proposals of four other banks which were better placed and had made better offers. As against these submissions of the writ petitioners, the stand of the RBI and the Central Government was that the Bank was in serious financial difficulties and therefore, the moratorium had to be imposed. The moratorium was fully justified on the facts of the case. The decision to amalgamate the appellant Bank with the Federal Bank was arrived at in full compliance with the statutory requirements and after considering relevant materials on record as well as the  Page 3 of 15 suggestions and objections from the appellant-Bank and all concerned, and after examining the proposals from the four other banks. It was, therefore, submitted that there is no reason to interfere with the decisions arrived at by the RBI and the Central Government which essentially were for benefit of the depositors. It was submitted that the interest of the employees was taken care of and the interest of the shareholders obviously came last. According to the High Court the following two questions were to be adjudicated: ""(A) Whether the decision dated 7th January, 2006 of the Central Government imposing moratorium and to appoint two directors was mala fide, ultra vires the powers of the Central Government and the RBI, bad in law and void and unjustified on facts? (B) Whether the notification dated 9th January, 2006 containing the proposed scheme of amalgamation and the decision to sanction the amalgamation dated 24th January, 2006 were mala fide, ultra vires the powers of the Central Government and the RBI and unjustified on facts?"" Taking note of the factual background the High Court held that the inference drawn by RBI was a positive inference and cannot be termed to be perverse. The High Court felt that it is the discretion of the decision maker where two views are possible and if the regulatory body arrived at a conclusion on the basis of facts and figures before it and points out that it has been warning the Bank for last over three years it will not be proper for the High Court to substitute its judgment for that of the RBI. Therefore, it was held that the decision of the RBI to impose the moratorium was neither unjustified nor against the provisions of Section 45(1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (in short the ’Act’). It was noted that the RBI is an expert body to regulate the banking activities and its judgment based on the factual scenario cannot be substituted by the High Court, may be because another view of the matter was possible. The High Court held that the allegation of mala fides was not substantiated. It was also of the view that while dealing with the question of mala fides, the following questions were also to be dealt with: ""(i) The first one is non-consideration of any scheme for reconstruction before going for amalgamation. (ii) The second is with respect to proposing amalgamation with Federal Bank on 9th January, 2006 itself. (iii) The third facet is not considering the proposal of other banks. (iv) The fourth is in respect to an adequate opportunity under Section 45(6) and (7) of the Act."" After considering the rival submissions, the High Court  Page 4 of 15 held that the allegations were mala fides and were not established. Accordingly, the writ petitions were dismissed. The stands taken before the High Court were re-iterated by learned counsel appearing for the appellant and the respondents. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the undue and unseemly haste with which the order of moratorium dated 7.1.2006 was passed is a clear indication of mala fides. Moreover, full and correct facts were not placed by the RBI before the Central Government, in particular, facts regarding bank balances with the RBI and other banks and cash at hand amounting to Rs.36.62 crores were not placed before the Central Government. Actual figure of those liquid assets were Rs.119 crores as against total deposits of Rs.217.43 crores which is 55% against required 25% as per RBI norms. This was indicative of the bank’s strong liquidity position. Total assets of the bank as on 31.3.2005 were Rs.235.44 crores as against total liabilities of Rs.220.45 crores. Therefore, the assets were exceeding the liabilities by Rs.14.99 crores. Even as on 31.12.2005, the assets were exceeding the liabilities by Rs.17.70 crores. The net loss in the year 2004-05 on which great stress was laid by the RBI and the Central Government was on account of notional/book entry loss with respect to additional provision for Non Performing Assets (in short the ’NPAs’) and depreciation in the value of Government securities. In respect of Urban Cooperative Banks, the RBI has relaxed provisional norms up to 5 years in respect of depreciation in the value of Government securities. However, the same was denied to the Bank. Majority advances of the banks were given to the priority sector namely Agricultural advances to which Securitisation Act is not applicable. Therefore, relaxation was necessary to be given. The RBI had granted permission to the Bank to open three new Branches after being satisfied that the Bank was in a sound financial position. Several awards were given to the Bank for exercising banking services. There was no complaint from any depositor, customer or shareholder and the Bank has not defaulted in payment of taxes or other government dues. When objections were called for by the RBI regarding amalgamation within a span of 15 days in January, 2006, out of the total objections received by RBI, 97.49% of the customers/depositors objected to moratorium and/or amalgamation of the Bank and have opted for independent entity of the Bank. The factual scenario indicates that the proposal for amalgamation with the Federal Bank was circulated and in a pre-determined manner the proposal was ultimately approved on 24.1.2006. The draft scheme of amalgamation was sent to the Central Government to be operative w.e.f. 27.1.2006. When the appellant-Bank approached the High Court on 24.1.2006 and the copy of the writ petition was served on the RBI and the Central Government, the Notification of amalgamation w.e.f. 25.1.2006 was issued on 24.1.2006 itself so that it could be argued before the High Court that the appellant Bank was no longer in existence on 25.1.2006. The exercise of power under Section 45 of the Act was done solely for the purpose of favoring the Federal Bank. Though Section 36(AB) of the Act empowers the RBI to appoint Additional Directors there is no provision which empowers RBI to direct that no decision of the Board of Directors would be valid  Page 5 of 15 unless it is approved by the Directors appointed by the RBI. The entire exercise was pre-conceived under the garb of exercise of statutory authority. There was a systematic plan to amalgamate the appellant-Bank with the Federal Bank. The entire proceedings are thus vitiated by malice in law. The rejection of the proposal of Saraswat Bank is vitiated on account of misunderstanding of Section 56(zb) of the Act and on account of a failure to consider the interest of shareholders whose interest would continue to be of paramount importance. On account of heavy floods there was temporary disruption of banking activities and this aspect has not been considered. The fact that Federal Banks’ Board Meeting was preponed from 11.1.2006 to 8.1.2006 is a pointer to the fact that they were very much in know of things to gain under advantage. The data given by the RBI relating to some other amalgamation i.e. in cases of Global Trust Bank and Nedgundi Bank have no relevance as in those cases there were large scale complaints of fraud. In response, learned counsel for the respondent No.4 i.e. Federal Bank submitted as follows: The procedure, process and yardsticks envisaged under Section 45 of the Act for the amalgamation of a financially unviable bank with a stronger bank, cannot be the same as are applicable to a tender process. It is submitted that when acting under Section 45 of the Act, the primary consideration must be of public interest. Under the said provision, the RBI has the statutory duty and responsibility to act swiftly and decisively to protect interests of depositors and public confidence in the banking system. In contrast, when awarding a tender, it is primarily commercial considerations that must be the selection process. It is, therefore, submitted that it is in public interest not to interfere on commercial consideration with a decision made under Section 45 so long as it safeguards depositors’ interests and public confidence in the banking system in an emergent situation. The respondent No.4-Federal Bank is a financially strong bank with high net worth, large capital funds and huge amount of deposits with more than adequate capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (in short the ’CRAR’). Its net worth is about Rs.897 crores and its capital is about Rs.85 crores It has deposits to the tune of Rs.16,448 crores and its CRAR at 11.34%, exceeds the Reserve Bank of India requirement of 9%. It has a very low percentage of NPA with its Gross NPAs being 5.17% and Net NPA being 1.41%. As of 31st December, 2005 Federal Bank has recorded a profit of Rs.174.48 crores. The contrast on each of these parameters with the appellant-Bank is striking. On each parameter, the performance of the appellant-Bank is abysmal in comparison to Federal Bank. It is also pertinent to note that Section 45 of the Act does not contemplate or require the consent of either the transferor or the transferee bank, although both are given an opportunity to lodge their objections/suggestions to the draft scheme, before a final decision is taken. It was submitted that Federal Bank was not privy to any information from RBI regarding the status of the appellant Bank or any proposal to impose a moratorium at any time  Page 6 of 15 prior to 7.1.2006 when for the first time the order of moratorium and the RBI’s press release was placed on RBI’s website. It was also submitted that allegations of complicity based on the advancement of the date of Federal Bank’s Board Meeting from 11.1.2006 to 8.1.2006 are completely unfounded. It was submitted that Federal Bank had indeed vide its Notice dated 29.12.2005 originally scheduled the said Board Meeting for 11.1.2006 at Kochi, but this date was found to be inconvenient to several directors. Instead, 8.1.2006 was found to be a more convenient date for the meeting, since firstly many of the directors were congregating at Kochi for the wedding of the son of one of Directors on that date, and secondly, one other director, an NRI was scheduled to attend a meeting at the PMO on 7.1.2006. The said director would also have found it convenient to attend the Board Meeting, if it were to be held on 8.1.2006. In view thereof, for bona fide reasons and in good faith, the said Board meeting was rescheduled for 8.1.2006 vide notice dated 4.1.2006. Certain aspects which have been noted by the High Court to dismiss the appellant’s writ petition need to be noted to test how for the conclusions are correct. The first is whether there were ""good reasons"" for the RBI to apply to the Central Government for the moratorium which led to the impugned order dated 24th January, 2006, the concept of ""good reasons"" contemplated under Section and as to how the RBI justifies its decision on the basis of the yardstick applied by it. As far as the appellant bank is concerned, its case is that it is a small commercial bank and the only year in which it had made losses was for the financial year 2004-05. That was because of the value of the Government securities going down and the provisioning norms being made more stringent by the RBI. According to the RBI’s application to the Central Government, the net worth of the petitioner bank had become negative and so also CRAR had become negative and was at 5.83. As against this stand of the RBI, it was pointed out on behalf of the appellant-Bank that Annexure-I to RBI’s application under Section 45(1) dated 4th January, 2006 contained the key financial positions of the Bank. Clause 8 thereof dealt with the NPAs. It was pointed that the net NPAs had gone down from 10.59% to 8.32%. It was also pointed out that the Bank had done good resource mobilization in the meantime and its paid up capital had gone up from Rs.1.52 crore to Rs.1.82 crore. In para 5 of the letter, the RBI wrote to the Additional Secretary, Ministry of Finance that infusing fresh capital did not appear to be feasible. There was reluctance on the part of the shareholders and directors to merge with the stronger Bank. It was therefore imperative to make immediate arrangement to protect the interest of the depositors to merge with another bank. It is for this purpose that the moratorium was proposed under Section 45(1) In the counter affidavit filed before the High Court, it was stated on behalf of RBI that in June 1998, the Chairman of the appellant Bank was advised that old private sector banks having present net worth of Rs.5 lakhs should attain the level of Rs.50 crores within a period of 3 years On 12th January, 1999, the appellant -Bank sent the plan to augment resources  Page 7 of 15 up to Rs.20.08 crores over the period of 5 years. At on 31st March, 2002 its net worth stood at only Rs.6.62 crores and its paid up capital as on 31st March, 2005 was Rs.1.82 crore. It was further stated that as per the Bank’s Balance Sheet as on 31st March, 2005, it had reported the net loss of Rs.5.97 crores. In view of the deteriorating financial position, further meetings were held on 12th August, 2005, 26th August, 2005 and 12th September, 2005 to point out the major concerns of RBI vis. low paid up capital of Rs.182 crore, high level of gross NPAs (18.04%) and net loss of Rs.5.97 crores. On 14th October, 2005 the bank was asked to submit a detailed plan for capital augmentation. It is on the background that the moratorium was imposed on 7th January, 2006. Appellants’ stand was that since deposits with the Bank were Rs.92 crores, it was irrational to insist that it should have capital funds of Rs.50 crores. It was however pointed out that the Bank was consistently increased its capital and it stood at Rs.2.95 crores by 5th January, 2006 which included Rs.1.13 crore in the form of share application money. It was nothing but a part of share capital. Again, as far as NPAs are concerned, they had gone down from 14.10% to 9% and, as far as loss of Rs.5.97 crores is concerned, it is because of the change in the provisioning norms. High Court noted that the Bank had paid up capital of Rs.1.82 crores only, high gross NPAs at 18.04% and net loss of Rs.3.97 crores. It was in these circumstances that the RBI had to decide as to whether the depositors of the Bank required any protection. RBI had been monitoring the financial position of the Bank since June 1998 and since December 2003 the Bank had been placed under monthly monitoring as provided under Section 27 of the Act. According to High Court, expression ""good reasons"" under Section 45(1), primarily relates to interest of the depositors and the interest of the Bank. This is because the primary objective of the Act is protection of the interest of depositors as against the primary objective of the Company Law which is to safeguard the interest of shareholders. This is what is specifically stated in the Objects and Reasons of the Act. On these facts, the RBI was of the view that an appropriate action was necessary. It could not be said that the decision was lacking in the absence of good reasons. It is difficult to say that it was taken for the benefit of the Federal Bank since these reasons go back to December 2003 when Federal Bank was not in picture. It has been submitted that a small bank like the appellant cannot be expected to have the Capital Adequacy of Rs.50 crores as advised in June 1998 and which was later on revised to Rs.300 crores by circular dated 20th February 2004. Reference is made to Section 11(3)(i) of the Act which provides that if a banking company has places of its business in more than one State, it is required to have the aggregate value of its paid-up capital and reserves at not less than Rs.5 lakhs. If that is the expectation, the RBI cannot insist on the requirement of Rs.50 crores and then go on increasing it further. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in Assam Co. Ltd. v. State of Assam (2001 (4) SCC 202), which lays down that a delegate cannot over-ride the Act either by exceeding the authority or by making provision which is inconsistent with the Act. On the other hand, stand of RBI is that the language of Section 11(3)(i) is that in the case of such a banking company, the aggregate value of paid-up capital and reserves shall not be less than Rs.5 lakhs. Therefore, insistence of Rs.50 crores or a higher amount cannot be said  Page 8 of 15 to be erroneous. With globalisation, finance and banking in rural areas also have to improve and it is from that point of view that the RBI had expected the above referred enhancement. That was expected from all similarly situated banks and not merely from the appellant-Bank alone. Reference is made to the expectations under the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, 1988 and the first Narasimham Committee Report on Financial System, 1991 which recommended on the basis of the Basle Committee that India also must conform to the international standards of capital adequacy in a phased manner. Second Narsimham Committee Report on Banking Sector Reforms of 1998 led RBI to issue guidelines to revise the minimum paid-up capital for the private sector banks. The actual scenario shows that when the paid-up capital of the Bank is so low, namely Rs.1.82 crore, its gross NPAs are at higher level (8.04%), its net worth had turned negative and the net loss is Rs.5.97 crores. There was nothing wrong on the part of the RBI to expect an appropriate plan of capital augmentation. The Bank has not been able to do that and it was quite likely that it would land into difficulties. The phrase ""good reasons"" in sub-section (1) of Section 45 is a term of wide amplitude and it will not be correct to restrict it only to the actions mentioned under sub-section (2) of Section 45 of the Act as is contended by the appellant. The provision is concerned with preparing a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation which would become necessary where the RBI is satisfied about the existence of any of the four grounds mentioned in Section 45(4). Apart from public interest and the interest of the banking system, which are provided in sub-clause (a) and (d) thereof, Section 45(4) provides for the necessary action in the interest of the depositors or with a view to secure proper management of the bank which are grounds (b) and (c) in that sub-section. Precursor to the framing of the scheme is the imposition of the moratorium which is provided in sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 45. Existence of court proceedings, mentioned in section 45(2), would certainly be one of the good reasons to impose moratorium, but that certainly cannot be the only one. Considering that object of the Act is protection of the interest of the depositors, such an interpretation of the concept of ""good reasons"" will have to be adopted, and not a narrow one. It has been contended that there was a negative impact when moratorium was imposed, and there were long queues at four branches of the appellant Bank on 8th January 2006. The RBI arranged to send an amount of Rs.2 crores to the Bank from its Current Account to meet the depositors’ demands. The manager of the Appellant Bank’s branch at Dadar has made an affidavit to state that he had not asked for an amount of Rs.2 crores and yet it was sent by RBI. The branch manager has further stated that depositors were unhappy with the decision of RBI. These are all disputed questions as rightly noted by the High Court. As far as the views of the depositors are concerned, they are bound to vary from person to person and no definite conclusion can be drawn merely on the bank manager’s affidavit that people were angry against RBI. Besides, no depositor has questioned legality of the action. It can be said that the action of the RBI is a pre-emptive action which it took considering the then financial position of the appellant Bank and to prevent further difficulties which were likely. It is not that when there is a run on the bank then only RBI must intervene or that it must intervene only when there are good number of court proceedings against the concerned bank. The RBI has to take into account the totality of the circumstances and has to form  Page 9 of 15 its opinion accordingly. The ultimate question is whether the inference drawn by the RBI is a possible inference or is something which can be said to be a perverse one. Even if two views are possible since the regulating body has arrived at a conclusion on the basis of the facts and figures before it, and it has pointed out that it has been warning the appellant Bank for last over 3 years, it will not be proper for the Courts to substitute their judgment for that of RBI. In the circumstances, it cannot hold that the decision of RBI to impose the moratorium was unjustified or against the provisions of section 45(1) or such that one can call it a perverse one and interfere with it. The RBI is an expert body to regulate the banking activities. The moratorium has been challenged on the ground of malafides also. This challenge along with the challenge to amalgamation also on the basis of malafides needs to be considered. As far as the challenge to the appointment of two directors on the Board of Directors of the appellant Bank is concerned, the RBI has the necessary power under Section 36AB of the Act. In the circumstances, it cannot be faulted for appointing the two directors. That brings into focus the question as to whether the decision of RBI to recommend a scheme for amalgamation on 9th January 2006 and the decision of the Government to sanction the amalgamation on 24th January 2006 could be said to be mala fide or bad in law. As far as this question is concerned, it contains many sub-questions which are as follows: (i) The first one is non-consideration of any scheme for reconstruction before going for amalgamation. (ii) The second is with respect to proposing amalgamation with Federal Bank on 9th January 2006 itself. (iii) The third facet is not considering the proposal of four other banks. (iv) The fourth is with respect to an adequate opportunity under Section 45(6) and (7) of the Act. Now, as far as the first two questions of non consideration of reconstruction and proposing merger with Federal Bank, the RBI has noted that the Bank was in difficulties from 1990 and particularly from December 2003 when it was placed under monthly monitoring. RBI in its application for moratorium to the Central Government dated 4th January 2006 had clearly stated that during the discussion with the appellant-Bank, major shareholders and directors had shown total reluctance to merge into the stronger bank. In view thereof, it was imperative that immediate arrangement to protect the interest of the depositors was to be made through its merger with a bank under Section 45 of the Act. RBI had, therefore, made an effort and called upon the appellant-Bank, that if possible, to explore the possibility of merger with another stronger bank. It had also made an effort to impress that there should be infusion of fresh capital. That was not coming. There could be a reconstruction by bringing in more money or by narrowing the size of the appellant-Bank which did not appear to be feasible. The only option left was that of amalgamation. When a moratorium is imposed, RBI was duty bound to prepare a scheme either of reconstruction or of amalgamation under Section 45(4) with any other banking institution. Thus, RBI had to give a scheme. Federal Bank had responded immediately and unconditionally. The fact that the appellant   15 Bank was put under moratorium was advertised on web site on 7th January 2006 itself. It is at that stage that Federal Bank promptly gave its proposal on 8th January 2006. The Federal Bank gave three reasons in its letter to RBI which were as follows: (i) Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. has 32 branches situated in Western Maharashtra and Belgaum area of Karanataka. Our presence in this area is very minimal and adding up of the branches of Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. will enable us to have significant presence in the area. (ii) Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. has mot of the branches in the agricultural heartland which would enable us to augment our credit disbursal to agricultural sector. (iii). Small size of Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. ensures that there will not be any difficulty in the merger process between our bank and them. Thereafter it stated as follows: We also inform our unconditional acceptance to make full payment to depositors and that we will not demand any regulatory forbearance."" Thus, the Federal Bank was ready to honour full liabilities of the depositors and did not ask for any concessions. Therefore, on the basis of a standard scheme, the opinion of the appellant-Bank was sought on 9th January 2006 with respect to merger in Federal Bank. The scheme was described as a ""cut and paste scheme"" and of RBI’s action as a regulator in the interest of the depositors was highlighted. It appears that the action of the RBI was based on the finding about the negative net worth and CRAR of the Appellant-Bank, its inability to infuse fresh capital and the continued existence of a high level of NPAs. It has been rightly pointed out that once it was decided to amalgamate by reason of Section 45 of the Act, the RBI had to move with utmost expedition. This is of paramount importance to prevent erosion of the confidence of the depositors. Once such confidence is lost it becomes difficult to revive the confidence and the credibility. This Court had occasion to deal with need for expedition in Joseph Kuruvilla Vellukunnel v. Reserve Bank of India and Ors. (1962 (Supp.) 3 SCR 632) and Reserve Bank of India and Ors. v. Timex Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. and Ors. (1992 (2) SCC 344). It is not in dispute that there were long queues and on 8.1.2006 the one branch of the appellant-Bank actually faced cash shortage and had to draw its funds with the RBI protecting the interest of the depositors because during such period there are severe restrictions on the ability of the depositors to operate their bank accounts. Therefore, with a view to protect the interest of the depositors, the RBI has to act expeditiously to identify another bank prepared to take over the appellant-Bank and keeping in view the background principles governing merger and amalgamation RBI had to act with expedition. The factual scenario does not show that there was any undue haste or mala fides involved. Under Section 45 of the Act, the primary consideration is public interest. There is an underlying object of acting swiftly and decisively to protest interests of depositors and ensure   of 15 public confidence in the banking system. The emergent situation which warrants action with expedition cannot be lost sight of while deciding the legality of the action. It is brought on record that Federal Banks’ strength lay on the fact that it is a strong bank with huge net worth, large capital funds and huge amount of deposits with more than adequate CRAR. Its net worth is about Rs.897 crores, capital is around Rs.85 crores, and deposits to the tune of Rs.16,448 crores. Its CRAR (11.34%) exceeds the RBI requirement (9%) and percentage of NPAs (Gross and Net) is (5.17% and 1.41% respectively). For the accounting period ending 31st December, 2005 its profit is Rs.174 Crores. As observed by this Court in Bari Doab Bank Ltd. v. Union of India and Ors. (1997 (6) SCC 417) the provisions of Section 45 of the Act provide adequate opportunity of a representation and no additional opportunity is required to be given. The objection filed by the appellant-Bank was duly considered. In fact, certain objections were raised and comments of the RBI on them were forwarded to the Central Government along with the final recommendations. The RBI was of the view that the proposal received from the Federal Bank was best under the circumstances and, therefore, the same appears to have been accepted. At this juncture it is to be noted that offer of Federal Bank was an unconditional offer, whereby it proposed to take over the responsibility of any regulatory forbearance. Three reasons given by the Federal Bank to take over the appellant’s Bank were considered cogent reasons and, therefore, RBI’s decision cannot be faulted. As rightly contended the offers received from the City Bank, Standard Chartered Bank were neither comprehensive nor unconditional. In fact, they were not concluded offers, since they were both dependent upon a request for due diligence and in certain instances regulatory forbearances. Ratnakar Bank’s offer was not accepted as it was itself an ailing bank. Learned counsel for the appellants has highlighted that Sarastwat Bank’s offer was an equally good offer if not better and should have been accepted. It has been pointed out by learned counsel for the respondents that Saraswat Bank is a Multi State Co-operative Bank and its functioning is governed by Multi State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002 (in short ’2002 Act’). The legal opinion available to the RBI was that it was not feasible or permissible to amalgamate a commercial bank with a cooperative Bank by reason of the provisions of the Act as well as 2002 Act. The RBI was of the view that such amalgamation is not possible under Sections 17 and 18 of the 2002 Act as also Section 56 (zb) of the Act. It was pointed out that Saraswat Bank cannot be considered to be a banking company for the purpose of Section 45(4) to 45(15) of the Act. In order to be a banking company within the meaning of the Act, the entity in question must be a company. Section 56(zb) of the Act excludes the applicability of Section 45(4) to 45(15) so far as cooperative banks are concerned. It was pointed out that even if it is conceded for the sake of argument that legally amalgamation is permissible it could have taken a very long time to get requisite clearance from several other agencies under the 2002 Act and could not have gone through expeditiously. It is also pointed out that an amalgamation of Multi State Cooperative Bank is subject to far less regulatory control of the RBI especially in relation to non banking matters. There is no dispute that the application made by   of 15 Saraswat Bank was duly considered by the RBI. The scope of Judicial review in administrative matters has been the subject matter of consideration before this Court in several cases. There should be judicial restraint while making judicial review in administrative matters. Where irrelevant aspects have been eschewed from consideration and no relevant aspect has been ignored and the administrative decisions have nexus with the facts on record, there is no scope for interference. The duty of the court is (a) to confine itself to the question of legality; (b) to decide whether the decision making authority exceeded its powers (c) committed an error of law (d) committed breach of the rules of natural justice and (e) reached a decision which no reasonable Tribunal would have reached or (f) abused its powers. Administrative action is subject to control by judicial review in the following manner: (i) Illegality: This means the decision maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give effect to it. (ii) Irrationality, namely, Wednesbury unreasonableness. (iii) Procedural impropriety. One of the points that falls for determination is the scope for judicial interference in matters of administrative decisions. Administrative action is stated to be referable to broad area of Governmental activities in which the repositories of power may exercise every class of statutory function of executive, quasi legislative and quasi-judicial nature. It is trite law that exercise of power, whether legislative or administrative, will be set aside if there is manifest error in the exercise of such power or the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary (See State of U.P. and Ors. v. Renusagar Power Co. and Ors. (AIR 1988 SC 1737). At one time, the traditional view in England was that the executive was not answerable where its action was attributable to the exercise of prerogative power. Professor De Smith in his classical work ""Judicial Review of Administrative Action"" 4th Edition at pages 285-287 states the legal position in his own terse language that the relevant principles formulated by the Courts may be broadly summarized as follows. The authority in which discretion is vested can be compelled to exercise that discretion, but not to exercise it in any particular manner. In general, discretion must be exercised only by the authority to which it is committed. That authority must genuinely address itself to the matter before it; it must not act under the dictates of another body or disable itself from exercising discretion in each individual case. In the purported exercise of its discretion, it must not do what it has been forbidden to do, nor must it do what it has not been authorized to do. It must act in good faith, must have regard to all relevant considerations and must not be influenced by irrelevant considerations, must not seek to promote purposes alien to the letter or to the spirit of the legislation that gives it power to act, and must not act arbitrarily or capriciously. These several principles can conveniently be grouped in two main categories: (i) failure to exercise a discretion, and (ii) excess or abuse of discretionary power. The two classes are not, however, mutually exclusive.  Page 13 of 15 Thus, discretion may be improperly fettered because irrelevant considerations have been taken into account, and where an authority hands over its discretion to another body it acts ultra vires. The present trend of judicial opinion is to restrict the doctrine of immunity from judicial review to those classes of cases which relate to deployment of troupes, entering into international treaties, etc. The distinctive features of some of these recent cases signify the willingness of the Courts to assert their power to scrutinize the factual basis upon which discretionary powers have been exercised. One can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first ground is ’illegality’ the second ’irrationality’, and the third ’procedural impropriety’. These principles were highlighted by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984 (3) All.ER.935), (commonly known as CCSU Case). If the power has been exercised on a non-consideration or non-application of mind to relevant factors, the exercise of power will be regarded as manifestly erroneous. If a power (whether legislative or administrative) is exercised on the basis of facts which do not exist and which are patently erroneous, such exercise of power will stand vitiated. (See commissioner of Income-tax v. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. (AIR 1984 SC 1182) . The effect of several decisions on the question of jurisdiction has been summed up by Grahame Aldous and John Alder in their book ""Applications for Judicial Review, Law and Practice"" thus: ""There is a general presumption against ousting the jurisdiction of the courts, so that statutory provisions which purport to exclude judicial review are construed restrictively. There are, however, certain areas of governmental activity, national security being the paradig, which the courts regard themselves as incompetent to investigate, beyond an initial decision as to whether the government’s claim is bona fide. In this kind of non-justiciable area judicial review is not entirely excluded, but very limited. It has also been said that powers conferred by the Royal Prerogative are inherently unreviewable but since the speeches of the House of Lords in council of civil Service Unions v. Minister for the civil Service this is doubtful. Lords Diplock, Scaman and. Roskili appeared to agree that there is no general distinction between powers, based upon whether their source is statutory or prerogative but that judicial review can be limited by the subject matter of a particular power, in that case national security. May prerogative powers are in fact concerned with sensitive, non justiciable areas, for example, foreign affairs, but some are reviewable in principle, including the prerogatives relating to the civil service where national security is not involved. Another non\027justiciable power is the Attorney General’s prerogative to decide whether to institute legal proceedings on behalf of the public interest.""  Page 14 of 15 (Also see Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (LR (1968) AC 997). The court will be slow to interfere in such matters relating to administrative functions unless decision is tainted by any vulnerability enumerated above; like illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. Whether action falls within any of the categories has to be established. Mere assertion in that regard would not be sufficient. The famous case commonly known as ""The Wednesbury’s case"" is treated as the landmark so far as laying down various basic principles relating to judicial review of administrative or statutory direction. Before summarizing the substance of the principles laid down therein we shall refer to the passage from the judgment of Lord Greene in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corpn. (KB at p. 229: All ER p. 682). It reads as follows: ""\005\005It is true that discretion must be exercised reasonably. Now what does that mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology used in relation to exercise of statutory discretions often use the word ’unreasonable’ in a rather comprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is frequently used as a general description of the things that must not be done. For instance, a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law. He must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is said, to be acting ’unreasonably’ . Similarly, there may be something so absurd that no sensible person could even dream that it lay within the powers the authority. . . . In another, it is taking into consideration extraneous matters. It is unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith; and in fact, all these things run into one another."" Lord Greene also observed (KB p.230: All ER p.683) ""\005..it must be proved to be unreasonable in the sense that the court considers it to be a decision that no reasonable body can come to. It is not what the court considers unreasonable The effect of the legislation is not to set up the court as an arbiter of the correctness of one view over another."" (emphasis supplied) Therefore, to arrive at a decision on ""reasonableness"" the Court has to find out if the administrator has left out relevant factors or taken into account irrelevant factors. The decision of the administrator must have been within the four corners of the law, and not one which no sensible person could have reasonably arrived at, having regard to the above principles, and must have been a bona fide one. The decision could be  Page 15 of 15 one of many choices open to the authority but it was for that authority to decide upon the choice and not for the Court to substitute its view. The principles of judicial review of administrative action were further summarized in 1985 by Lord Diplock in CCSU case as illegality, procedural impropriety and irrationality. He said more grounds could in future become available, including the doctrine of proportionality which was a principle followed by certain other members of the European Economic Community. Lord Diplock observed in that case as follows: ""\005\005.Judicial review has I think, developed to a stage today when, without reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first ground I would call ’illegality’, the second ’irrationality’ and the third ’procedural impropriety’. That is not to say that further development on a case\027by\027case basis may not in course of time add further grounds. I have in mind particularly the possible adoption in the future of the principle of ’proportionality’ which is recognized in the administrative law of several of our fellow members of the European Economic Community."" Lord Diplock explained ""irrationality"" as follows: ""By ’irrationality’ I mean what can by now be succinctly referred to as Wednesbury unreasonableness’. It applies to a decision which is to outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it."" In other words, to characterize a decision of the administrator as ""irrational"" the Court has to hold, on material, that it is a decision ""so outrageous"" as to be in total defiance of logic or moral standards. Adoption of ""proportionality"" into administrative law was left for the future. These principles have been noted in aforesaid terms in Union of India and Anr. v. C. Ganayutham (1997 [7] SCC 463). In essence, the test is to see whether there is any infirmity in the decision making process and not in the decision itself. (See Indian Railways Construction Co. Ltd. v. Ajay Kumar (2003 (4) SCC 579). Looked at from the aforesaid angle, the judgment of the High Court does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference. The appeal is dismissed.","J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (C) No. 7188 of 2006) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. The present appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 5.4.2006 passed by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No.337/2006 questioning Notification dated 7th January, 2006 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance imposing a moratorium in respect of the appellant-Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""Bank"") for a period of three months from the date of order upto and inclusive of 6th April, 2006. Amongst others, the said Bank was directed not to grant any loan or advances or incur liability without the permission in writing of the Reserve Bank of India (in short the ’RBI’’). Further, withdrawal of sums not exceeding 5,000/- by a Savings Bank or Current Account holder was permitted with a further relaxation of amount not exceeding Rs.10,000/- or the actual balance whichever is less in the event of certain difficulties such as medical treatment, higher education and obligatory expenses like marriage etc. Challenge was also made to the appointment of two Directors on the Board of Directors of the Bank. Further Challenge was made to the Notification dated 9.1.2006 proposing a scheme of amalgamation of the Bank with Federal Bank, another private sector commercial bank and to the order dated 24.1.2006 sanctioning amalgamation of Bank with Federal Bank. It is to be noted that along with the said writ petition filed by the Bank, another writ petition (WP(C) No. 160/2006) was filed by one Mr. Sunil Mahadev Chavan. The background facts in which the writ petitions were filed are essentially as follows: Appellant Bank was founded sometimes in the year 1920 and is having a banking license given by the RBI. It has some 32 branches situated principally in districts of Kolhapur and Sangli of Maharashtra and the adjoining Belgaum District of Karnataka. It has around 1,75,000 depositors in the rural   of 15 areas of these three districts. It was carrying on its activities smoothly, and it incurred losses only once and that was in the financial year 2004-05. That was also for the reasons which were beyond its control, viz (i) the value of the government securities, wherein it had made deposits, went down, and (ii) the provisioning norms set up by the RBI were made more stringent by it. It was on this background that it was shocked to receive the order of moratorium in the morning of 8th January, 2006. It led to unnecessary long queue at its Dadar branch, Mumbai, though there was no run on the bank any time in the past or even on that day as such. Thereafter, the issuance of the moratorium and the decision of the RBI to take further steps was duly advertised. The RBI appointed two directors of its own on the Board of Directors of the appellant-Bank on 7th January, 2006. The RBI then notified the proposed scheme of amalgamating the appellant-Bank with the Federal Bank on 9th January, 2006. The appellant-Bank objected to it by filing its objections on 23rd January, 2006, yet a decision was taken by the RBI and the Central Government on 24th January, 2006 sanctioning amalgamation of the appellant-Bank with the Federal Bank. An interim order was passed by the High Court in W.P.337/2006 by which operation of the order dated 24.6.2006 was stayed and status quo was directed to be maintained. The order was challenged by the RBI and Federal Bank before this Court. By Order dated 30.1.2006 this Court directed that the petitions were to be heard and decided early by the High Court. However, the interim order was left undisturbed. Before the High Court the principal submissions of the writ petitioners were two-fold, namely that the order dated 7th January, 2006 imposing moratorium and then the order dated 7th January, 2006 appointing two Directors are both mala fide to suit the convenience of Federal Bank, ultra vires the power of the RBI and the Central Government and, therefore, bad in law, illegal and void. Similarly, the other submission of the writ petitioners was that the subsequent framing of scheme of amalgamation on 9th January, 2006 and the decision to sanction the amalgamation taken on 24th January, 2006 are motivated and pre-planned decisions for the benefit of the Federal Bank, mala fide and ultra vires the powers of the Central Government and the RBI. It was further submitted that both these decisions are not justified on facts and have been arrived at without taking into consideration the relevant materials. As far as the first decision imposing the moratorium is concerned, it was submitted that there were no good reasons to impose the same and, as far as the decision to amalgamate is concerned, it was submitted that the said decision was arrived at without considering the proposals of four other banks which were better placed and had made better offers. As against these submissions of the writ petitioners, the stand of the RBI and the Central Government was that the Bank was in serious financial difficulties and therefore, the moratorium had to be imposed. The moratorium was fully justified on the facts of the case. The decision to amalgamate the appellant Bank with the Federal Bank was arrived at in full compliance with the statutory requirements and after considering relevant materials on record as well as the  Page 3 of 15 suggestions and objections from the appellant-Bank and all concerned, and after examining the proposals from the four other banks. It was, therefore, submitted that there is no reason to interfere with the decisions arrived at by the RBI and the Central Government which essentially were for benefit of the depositors. It was submitted that the interest of the employees was taken care of and the interest of the shareholders obviously came last. According to the High Court the following two questions were to be adjudicated: ""(A) Whether the decision dated 7th January, 2006 of the Central Government imposing moratorium and to appoint two directors was mala fide, ultra vires the powers of the Central Government and the RBI, bad in law and void and unjustified on facts? (B) Whether the notification dated 9th January, 2006 containing the proposed scheme of amalgamation and the decision to sanction the amalgamation dated 24th January, 2006 were mala fide, ultra vires the powers of the Central Government and the RBI and unjustified on facts?"" Taking note of the factual background the High Court held that the inference drawn by RBI was a positive inference and cannot be termed to be perverse. The High Court felt that it is the discretion of the decision maker where two views are possible and if the regulatory body arrived at a conclusion on the basis of facts and figures before it and points out that it has been warning the Bank for last over three years it will not be proper for the High Court to substitute its judgment for that of the RBI. Therefore, it was held that the decision of the RBI to impose the moratorium was neither unjustified nor against the provisions of Section 45(1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (in short the ’Act’). It was noted that the RBI is an expert body to regulate the banking activities and its judgment based on the factual scenario cannot be substituted by the High Court, may be because another view of the matter was possible. The High Court held that the allegation of mala fides was not substantiated. It was also of the view that while dealing with the question of mala fides, the following questions were also to be dealt with: ""(i) The first one is non-consideration of any scheme for reconstruction before going for amalgamation. (ii) The second is with respect to proposing amalgamation with Federal Bank on 9th January, 2006 itself. (iii) The third facet is not considering the proposal of other banks. (iv) The fourth is in respect to an adequate opportunity under Section 45(6) and (7) of the Act."" After considering the rival submissions, the High Court  Page 4 of 15 held that the allegations were mala fides and were not established. Accordingly, the writ petitions were dismissed. The stands taken before the High Court were re-iterated by learned counsel appearing for the appellant and the respondents. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the undue and unseemly haste with which the order of moratorium dated 7.1.2006 was passed is a clear indication of mala fides. Moreover, full and correct facts were not placed by the RBI before the Central Government, in particular, facts regarding bank balances with the RBI and other banks and cash at hand amounting to Rs.36.62 crores were not placed before the Central Government. Actual figure of those liquid assets were Rs.119 crores as against total deposits of Rs.217.43 crores which is 55% against required 25% as per RBI norms. This was indicative of the bank’s strong liquidity position. Total assets of the bank as on 31.3.2005 were Rs.235.44 crores as against total liabilities of Rs.220.45 crores. Therefore, the assets were exceeding the liabilities by Rs.14.99 crores. Even as on 31.12.2005, the assets were exceeding the liabilities by Rs.17.70 crores. The net loss in the year 2004-05 on which great stress was laid by the RBI and the Central Government was on account of notional/book entry loss with respect to additional provision for Non Performing Assets (in short the ’NPAs’) and depreciation in the value of Government securities. In respect of Urban Cooperative Banks, the RBI has relaxed provisional norms up to 5 years in respect of depreciation in the value of Government securities. However, the same was denied to the Bank. Majority advances of the banks were given to the priority sector namely Agricultural advances to which Securitisation Act is not applicable. Therefore, relaxation was necessary to be given. The RBI had granted permission to the Bank to open three new Branches after being satisfied that the Bank was in a sound financial position. Several awards were given to the Bank for exercising banking services. There was no complaint from any depositor, customer or shareholder and the Bank has not defaulted in payment of taxes or other government dues. When objections were called for by the RBI regarding amalgamation within a span of 15 days in January, 2006, out of the total objections received by RBI, 97.49% of the customers/depositors objected to moratorium and/or amalgamation of the Bank and have opted for independent entity of the Bank. The factual scenario indicates that the proposal for amalgamation with the Federal Bank was circulated and in a pre-determined manner the proposal was ultimately approved on 24.1.2006. The draft scheme of amalgamation was sent to the Central Government to be operative w.e.f. 27.1.2006. When the appellant-Bank approached the High Court on 24.1.2006 and the copy of the writ petition was served on the RBI and the Central Government, the Notification of amalgamation w.e.f. 25.1.2006 was issued on 24.1.2006 itself so that it could be argued before the High Court that the appellant Bank was no longer in existence on 25.1.2006. The exercise of power under Section 45 of the Act was done solely for the purpose of favoring the Federal Bank. Though Section 36(AB) of the Act empowers the RBI to appoint Additional Directors there is no provision which empowers RBI to direct that no decision of the Board of Directors would be valid  Page 5 of 15 unless it is approved by the Directors appointed by the RBI. The entire exercise was pre-conceived under the garb of exercise of statutory authority. There was a systematic plan to amalgamate the appellant-Bank with the Federal Bank. The entire proceedings are thus vitiated by malice in law. The rejection of the proposal of Saraswat Bank is vitiated on account of misunderstanding of Section 56(zb) of the Act and on account of a failure to consider the interest of shareholders whose interest would continue to be of paramount importance. On account of heavy floods there was temporary disruption of banking activities and this aspect has not been considered. The fact that Federal Banks’ Board Meeting was preponed from 11.1.2006 to 8.1.2006 is a pointer to the fact that they were very much in know of things to gain under advantage. The data given by the RBI relating to some other amalgamation i.e. in cases of Global Trust Bank and Nedgundi Bank have no relevance as in those cases there were large scale complaints of fraud. In response, learned counsel for the respondent No.4 i.e. Federal Bank submitted as follows: The procedure, process and yardsticks envisaged under Section 45 of the Act for the amalgamation of a financially unviable bank with a stronger bank, cannot be the same as are applicable to a tender process. It is submitted that when acting under Section 45 of the Act, the primary consideration must be of public interest. Under the said provision, the RBI has the statutory duty and responsibility to act swiftly and decisively to protect interests of depositors and public confidence in the banking system. In contrast, when awarding a tender, it is primarily commercial considerations that must be the selection process. It is, therefore, submitted that it is in public interest not to interfere on commercial consideration with a decision made under Section 45 so long as it safeguards depositors’ interests and public confidence in the banking system in an emergent situation. The respondent No.4-Federal Bank is a financially strong bank with high net worth, large capital funds and huge amount of deposits with more than adequate capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (in short the ’CRAR’). Its net worth is about Rs.897 crores and its capital is about Rs.85 crores It has deposits to the tune of Rs.16,448 crores and its CRAR at 11.34%, exceeds the Reserve Bank of India requirement of 9%. It has a very low percentage of NPA with its Gross NPAs being 5.17% and Net NPA being 1.41%. As of 31st December, 2005 Federal Bank has recorded a profit of Rs.174.48 crores. The contrast on each of these parameters with the appellant-Bank is striking. On each parameter, the performance of the appellant-Bank is abysmal in comparison to Federal Bank. It is also pertinent to note that Section 45 of the Act does not contemplate or require the consent of either the transferor or the transferee bank, although both are given an opportunity to lodge their objections/suggestions to the draft scheme, before a final decision is taken. It was submitted that Federal Bank was not privy to any information from RBI regarding the status of the appellant Bank or any proposal to impose a moratorium at any time  Page 6 of 15 prior to 7.1.2006 when for the first time the order of moratorium and the RBI’s press release was placed on RBI’s website. It was also submitted that allegations of complicity based on the advancement of the date of Federal Bank’s Board Meeting from 11.1.2006 to 8.1.2006 are completely unfounded. It was submitted that Federal Bank had indeed vide its Notice dated 29.12.2005 originally scheduled the said Board Meeting for 11.1.2006 at Kochi, but this date was found to be inconvenient to several directors. Instead, 8.1.2006 was found to be a more convenient date for the meeting, since firstly many of the directors were congregating at Kochi for the wedding of the son of one of Directors on that date, and secondly, one other director, an NRI was scheduled to attend a meeting at the PMO on 7.1.2006. The said director would also have found it convenient to attend the Board Meeting, if it were to be held on 8.1.2006. In view thereof, for bona fide reasons and in good faith, the said Board meeting was rescheduled for 8.1.2006 vide notice dated 4.1.2006. Certain aspects which have been noted by the High Court to dismiss the appellant’s writ petition need to be noted to test how for the conclusions are correct. The first is whether there were ""good reasons"" for the RBI to apply to the Central Government for the moratorium which led to the impugned order dated 24th January, 2006, the concept of ""good reasons"" contemplated under Section and as to how the RBI justifies its decision on the basis of the yardstick applied by it. As far as the appellant bank is concerned, its case is that it is a small commercial bank and the only year in which it had made losses was for the financial year 2004-05. That was because of the value of the Government securities going down and the provisioning norms being made more stringent by the RBI. According to the RBI’s application to the Central Government, the net worth of the petitioner bank had become negative and so also CRAR had become negative and was at 5.83. As against this stand of the RBI, it was pointed out on behalf of the appellant-Bank that Annexure-I to RBI’s application under Section 45(1) dated 4th January, 2006 contained the key financial positions of the Bank. Clause 8 thereof dealt with the NPAs. It was pointed that the net NPAs had gone down from 10.59% to 8.32%. It was also pointed out that the Bank had done good resource mobilization in the meantime and its paid up capital had gone up from Rs.1.52 crore to Rs.1.82 crore. In para 5 of the letter, the RBI wrote to the Additional Secretary, Ministry of Finance that infusing fresh capital did not appear to be feasible. There was reluctance on the part of the shareholders and directors to merge with the stronger Bank. It was therefore imperative to make immediate arrangement to protect the interest of the depositors to merge with another bank. It is for this purpose that the moratorium was proposed under Section 45(1) In the counter affidavit filed before the High Court, it was stated on behalf of RBI that in June 1998, the Chairman of the appellant Bank was advised that old private sector banks having present net worth of Rs.5 lakhs should attain the level of Rs.50 crores within a period of 3 years On 12th January, 1999, the appellant -Bank sent the plan to augment resources  Page 7 of 15 up to Rs.20.08 crores over the period of 5 years. At on 31st March, 2002 its net worth stood at only Rs.6.62 crores and its paid up capital as on 31st March, 2005 was Rs.1.82 crore. It was further stated that as per the Bank’s Balance Sheet as on 31st March, 2005, it had reported the net loss of Rs.5.97 crores. In view of the deteriorating financial position, further meetings were held on 12th August, 2005, 26th August, 2005 and 12th September, 2005 to point out the major concerns of RBI vis. low paid up capital of Rs.182 crore, high level of gross NPAs (18.04%) and net loss of Rs.5.97 crores. On 14th October, 2005 the bank was asked to submit a detailed plan for capital augmentation. It is on the background that the moratorium was imposed on 7th January, 2006. Appellants’ stand was that since deposits with the Bank were Rs.92 crores, it was irrational to insist that it should have capital funds of Rs.50 crores. It was however pointed out that the Bank was consistently increased its capital and it stood at Rs.2.95 crores by 5th January, 2006 which included Rs.1.13 crore in the form of share application money. It was nothing but a part of share capital. Again, as far as NPAs are concerned, they had gone down from 14.10% to 9% and, as far as loss of Rs.5.97 crores is concerned, it is because of the change in the provisioning norms. High Court noted that the Bank had paid up capital of Rs.1.82 crores only, high gross NPAs at 18.04% and net loss of Rs.3.97 crores. It was in these circumstances that the RBI had to decide as to whether the depositors of the Bank required any protection. RBI had been monitoring the financial position of the Bank since June 1998 and since December 2003 the Bank had been placed under monthly monitoring as provided under Section 27 of the Act. According to High Court, expression ""good reasons"" under Section 45(1), primarily relates to interest of the depositors and the interest of the Bank. This is because the primary objective of the Act is protection of the interest of depositors as against the primary objective of the Company Law which is to safeguard the interest of shareholders. This is what is specifically stated in the Objects and Reasons of the Act. On these facts, the RBI was of the view that an appropriate action was necessary. It could not be said that the decision was lacking in the absence of good reasons. It is difficult to say that it was taken for the benefit of the Federal Bank since these reasons go back to December 2003 when Federal Bank was not in picture. It has been submitted that a small bank like the appellant cannot be expected to have the Capital Adequacy of Rs.50 crores as advised in June 1998 and which was later on revised to Rs.300 crores by circular dated 20th February 2004. Reference is made to Section 11(3)(i) of the Act which provides that if a banking company has places of its business in more than one State, it is required to have the aggregate value of its paid-up capital and reserves at not less than Rs.5 lakhs. If that is the expectation, the RBI cannot insist on the requirement of Rs.50 crores and then go on increasing it further. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in Assam Co. Ltd. v. State of Assam (2001 (4) SCC 202), which lays down that a delegate cannot over-ride the Act either by exceeding the authority or by making provision which is inconsistent with the Act. On the other hand, stand of RBI is that the language of Section 11(3)(i) is that in the case of such a banking company, the aggregate value of paid-up capital and reserves shall not be less than Rs.5 lakhs. Therefore, insistence of Rs.50 crores or a higher amount cannot be said  Page 8 of 15 to be erroneous. With globalisation, finance and banking in rural areas also have to improve and it is from that point of view that the RBI had expected the above referred enhancement. That was expected from all similarly situated banks and not merely from the appellant-Bank alone. Reference is made to the expectations under the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, 1988 and the first Narasimham Committee Report on Financial System, 1991 which recommended on the basis of the Basle Committee that India also must conform to the international standards of capital adequacy in a phased manner. Second Narsimham Committee Report on Banking Sector Reforms of 1998 led RBI to issue guidelines to revise the minimum paid-up capital for the private sector banks. The actual scenario shows that when the paid-up capital of the Bank is so low, namely Rs.1.82 crore, its gross NPAs are at higher level (8.04%), its net worth had turned negative and the net loss is Rs.5.97 crores. There was nothing wrong on the part of the RBI to expect an appropriate plan of capital augmentation. The Bank has not been able to do that and it was quite likely that it would land into difficulties. The phrase ""good reasons"" in sub-section (1) of Section 45 is a term of wide amplitude and it will not be correct to restrict it only to the actions mentioned under sub-section (2) of Section 45 of the Act as is contended by the appellant. The provision is concerned with preparing a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation which would become necessary where the RBI is satisfied about the existence of any of the four grounds mentioned in Section 45(4). Apart from public interest and the interest of the banking system, which are provided in sub-clause (a) and (d) thereof, Section 45(4) provides for the necessary action in the interest of the depositors or with a view to secure proper management of the bank which are grounds (b) and (c) in that sub-section. Precursor to the framing of the scheme is the imposition of the moratorium which is provided in sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 45. Existence of court proceedings, mentioned in section 45(2), would certainly be one of the good reasons to impose moratorium, but that certainly cannot be the only one. Considering that object of the Act is protection of the interest of the depositors, such an interpretation of the concept of ""good reasons"" will have to be adopted, and not a narrow one. It has been contended that there was a negative impact when moratorium was imposed, and there were long queues at four branches of the appellant Bank on 8th January 2006. The RBI arranged to send an amount of Rs.2 crores to the Bank from its Current Account to meet the depositors’ demands. The manager of the Appellant Bank’s branch at Dadar has made an affidavit to state that he had not asked for an amount of Rs.2 crores and yet it was sent by RBI. The branch manager has further stated that depositors were unhappy with the decision of RBI. These are all disputed questions as rightly noted by the High Court. As far as the views of the depositors are concerned, they are bound to vary from person to person and no definite conclusion can be drawn merely on the bank manager’s affidavit that people were angry against RBI. Besides, no depositor has questioned legality of the action. It can be said that the action of the RBI is a pre-emptive action which it took considering the then financial position of the appellant Bank and to prevent further difficulties which were likely. It is not that when there is a run on the bank then only RBI must intervene or that it must intervene only when there are good number of court proceedings against the concerned bank. The RBI has to take into account the totality of the circumstances and has to form  Page 9 of 15 its opinion accordingly. The ultimate question is whether the inference drawn by the RBI is a possible inference or is something which can be said to be a perverse one. Even if two views are possible since the regulating body has arrived at a conclusion on the basis of the facts and figures before it, and it has pointed out that it has been warning the appellant Bank for last over 3 years, it will not be proper for the Courts to substitute their judgment for that of RBI. In the circumstances, it cannot hold that the decision of RBI to impose the moratorium was unjustified or against the provisions of section 45(1) or such that one can call it a perverse one and interfere with it. The RBI is an expert body to regulate the banking activities. The moratorium has been challenged on the ground of malafides also. This challenge along with the challenge to amalgamation also on the basis of malafides needs to be considered. As far as the challenge to the appointment of two directors on the Board of Directors of the appellant Bank is concerned, the RBI has the necessary power under Section 36AB of the Act. In the circumstances, it cannot be faulted for appointing the two directors. That brings into focus the question as to whether the decision of RBI to recommend a scheme for amalgamation on 9th January 2006 and the decision of the Government to sanction the amalgamation on 24th January 2006 could be said to be mala fide or bad in law. As far as this question is concerned, it contains many sub-questions which are as follows: (i) The first one is non-consideration of any scheme for reconstruction before going for amalgamation. (ii) The second is with respect to proposing amalgamation with Federal Bank on 9th January 2006 itself. (iii) The third facet is not considering the proposal of four other banks. (iv) The fourth is with respect to an adequate opportunity under Section 45(6) and (7) of the Act. Now, as far as the first two questions of non consideration of reconstruction and proposing merger with Federal Bank, the RBI has noted that the Bank was in difficulties from 1990 and particularly from December 2003 when it was placed under monthly monitoring. RBI in its application for moratorium to the Central Government dated 4th January 2006 had clearly stated that during the discussion with the appellant-Bank, major shareholders and directors had shown total reluctance to merge into the stronger bank. In view thereof, it was imperative that immediate arrangement to protect the interest of the depositors was to be made through its merger with a bank under Section 45 of the Act. RBI had, therefore, made an effort and called upon the appellant-Bank, that if possible, to explore the possibility of merger with another stronger bank. It had also made an effort to impress that there should be infusion of fresh capital. That was not coming. There could be a reconstruction by bringing in more money or by narrowing the size of the appellant-Bank which did not appear to be feasible. The only option left was that of amalgamation. When a moratorium is imposed, RBI was duty bound to prepare a scheme either of reconstruction or of amalgamation under Section 45(4) with any other banking institution. Thus, RBI had to give a scheme. Federal Bank had responded immediately and unconditionally. The fact that the appellant   15 Bank was put under moratorium was advertised on web site on 7th January 2006 itself. It is at that stage that Federal Bank promptly gave its proposal on 8th January 2006. The Federal Bank gave three reasons in its letter to RBI which were as follows: (i) Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. has 32 branches situated in Western Maharashtra and Belgaum area of Karanataka. Our presence in this area is very minimal and adding up of the branches of Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. will enable us to have significant presence in the area. (ii) Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. has mot of the branches in the agricultural heartland which would enable us to augment our credit disbursal to agricultural sector. (iii). Small size of Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. ensures that there will not be any difficulty in the merger process between our bank and them. Thereafter it stated as follows: We also inform our unconditional acceptance to make full payment to depositors and that we will not demand any regulatory forbearance."" Thus, the Federal Bank was ready to honour full liabilities of the depositors and did not ask for any concessions. Therefore, on the basis of a standard scheme, the opinion of the appellant-Bank was sought on 9th January 2006 with respect to merger in Federal Bank. The scheme was described as a ""cut and paste scheme"" and of RBI’s action as a regulator in the interest of the depositors was highlighted. It appears that the action of the RBI was based on the finding about the negative net worth and CRAR of the Appellant-Bank, its inability to infuse fresh capital and the continued existence of a high level of NPAs. It has been rightly pointed out that once it was decided to amalgamate by reason of Section 45 of the Act, the RBI had to move with utmost expedition. This is of paramount importance to prevent erosion of the confidence of the depositors. Once such confidence is lost it becomes difficult to revive the confidence and the credibility. This Court had occasion to deal with need for expedition in Joseph Kuruvilla Vellukunnel v. Reserve Bank of India and Ors. (1962 (Supp.) 3 SCR 632) and Reserve Bank of India and Ors. v. Timex Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. and Ors. (1992 (2) SCC 344). It is not in dispute that there were long queues and on 8.1.2006 the one branch of the appellant-Bank actually faced cash shortage and had to draw its funds with the RBI protecting the interest of the depositors because during such period there are severe restrictions on the ability of the depositors to operate their bank accounts. Therefore, with a view to protect the interest of the depositors, the RBI has to act expeditiously to identify another bank prepared to take over the appellant-Bank and keeping in view the background principles governing merger and amalgamation RBI had to act with expedition. The factual scenario does not show that there was any undue haste or mala fides involved. Under Section 45 of the Act, the primary consideration is public interest. There is an underlying object of acting swiftly and decisively to protest interests of depositors and ensure   of 15 public confidence in the banking system. The emergent situation which warrants action with expedition cannot be lost sight of while deciding the legality of the action. It is brought on record that Federal Banks’ strength lay on the fact that it is a strong bank with huge net worth, large capital funds and huge amount of deposits with more than adequate CRAR. Its net worth is about Rs.897 crores, capital is around Rs.85 crores, and deposits to the tune of Rs.16,448 crores. Its CRAR (11.34%) exceeds the RBI requirement (9%) and percentage of NPAs (Gross and Net) is (5.17% and 1.41% respectively). For the accounting period ending 31st December, 2005 its profit is Rs.174 Crores. As observed by this Court in Bari Doab Bank Ltd. v. Union of India and Ors. (1997 (6) SCC 417) the provisions of Section 45 of the Act provide adequate opportunity of a representation and no additional opportunity is required to be given. The objection filed by the appellant-Bank was duly considered. In fact, certain objections were raised and comments of the RBI on them were forwarded to the Central Government along with the final recommendations. The RBI was of the view that the proposal received from the Federal Bank was best under the circumstances and, therefore, the same appears to have been accepted. At this juncture it is to be noted that offer of Federal Bank was an unconditional offer, whereby it proposed to take over the responsibility of any regulatory forbearance. Three reasons given by the Federal Bank to take over the appellant’s Bank were considered cogent reasons and, therefore, RBI’s decision cannot be faulted. As rightly contended the offers received from the City Bank, Standard Chartered Bank were neither comprehensive nor unconditional. In fact, they were not concluded offers, since they were both dependent upon a request for due diligence and in certain instances regulatory forbearances. Ratnakar Bank’s offer was not accepted as it was itself an ailing bank. Learned counsel for the appellants has highlighted that Sarastwat Bank’s offer was an equally good offer if not better and should have been accepted. It has been pointed out by learned counsel for the respondents that Saraswat Bank is a Multi State Co-operative Bank and its functioning is governed by Multi State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002 (in short ’2002 Act’). The legal opinion available to the RBI was that it was not feasible or permissible to amalgamate a commercial bank with a cooperative Bank by reason of the provisions of the Act as well as 2002 Act. The RBI was of the view that such amalgamation is not possible under Sections 17 and 18 of the 2002 Act as also Section 56 (zb) of the Act. It was pointed out that Saraswat Bank cannot be considered to be a banking company for the purpose of Section 45(4) to 45(15) of the Act. In order to be a banking company within the meaning of the Act, the entity in question must be a company. Section 56(zb) of the Act excludes the applicability of Section 45(4) to 45(15) so far as cooperative banks are concerned. It was pointed out that even if it is conceded for the sake of argument that legally amalgamation is permissible it could have taken a very long time to get requisite clearance from several other agencies under the 2002 Act and could not have gone through expeditiously. It is also pointed out that an amalgamation of Multi State Cooperative Bank is subject to far less regulatory control of the RBI especially in relation to non banking matters. There is no dispute that the application made by   of 15 Saraswat Bank was duly considered by the RBI. The scope of Judicial review in administrative matters has been the subject matter of consideration before this Court in several cases. There should be judicial restraint while making judicial review in administrative matters. Where irrelevant aspects have been eschewed from consideration and no relevant aspect has been ignored and the administrative decisions have nexus with the facts on record, there is no scope for interference. The duty of the court is (a) to confine itself to the question of legality; (b) to decide whether the decision making authority exceeded its powers (c) committed an error of law (d) committed breach of the rules of natural justice and (e) reached a decision which no reasonable Tribunal would have reached or (f) abused its powers. Administrative action is subject to control by judicial review in the following manner: (i) Illegality: This means the decision maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give effect to it. (ii) Irrationality, namely, Wednesbury unreasonableness. (iii) Procedural impropriety. One of the points that falls for determination is the scope for judicial interference in matters of administrative decisions. Administrative action is stated to be referable to broad area of Governmental activities in which the repositories of power may exercise every class of statutory function of executive, quasi legislative and quasi-judicial nature. It is trite law that exercise of power, whether legislative or administrative, will be set aside if there is manifest error in the exercise of such power or the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary (See State of U.P. and Ors. v. Renusagar Power Co. and Ors. (AIR 1988 SC 1737). At one time, the traditional view in England was that the executive was not answerable where its action was attributable to the exercise of prerogative power. Professor De Smith in his classical work ""Judicial Review of Administrative Action"" 4th Edition at pages 285-287 states the legal position in his own terse language that the relevant principles formulated by the Courts may be broadly summarized as follows. The authority in which discretion is vested can be compelled to exercise that discretion, but not to exercise it in any particular manner. In general, discretion must be exercised only by the authority to which it is committed. That authority must genuinely address itself to the matter before it; it must not act under the dictates of another body or disable itself from exercising discretion in each individual case. In the purported exercise of its discretion, it must not do what it has been forbidden to do, nor must it do what it has not been authorized to do. It must act in good faith, must have regard to all relevant considerations and must not be influenced by irrelevant considerations, must not seek to promote purposes alien to the letter or to the spirit of the legislation that gives it power to act, and must not act arbitrarily or capriciously. These several principles can conveniently be grouped in two main categories: (i) failure to exercise a discretion, and (ii) excess or abuse of discretionary power. The two classes are not, however, mutually exclusive.  Page 13 of 15 Thus, discretion may be improperly fettered because irrelevant considerations have been taken into account, and where an authority hands over its discretion to another body it acts ultra vires. The present trend of judicial opinion is to restrict the doctrine of immunity from judicial review to those classes of cases which relate to deployment of troupes, entering into international treaties, etc. The distinctive features of some of these recent cases signify the willingness of the Courts to assert their power to scrutinize the factual basis upon which discretionary powers have been exercised. One can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first ground is ’illegality’ the second ’irrationality’, and the third ’procedural impropriety’. These principles were highlighted by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984 (3) All.ER.935), (commonly known as CCSU Case). If the power has been exercised on a non-consideration or non-application of mind to relevant factors, the exercise of power will be regarded as manifestly erroneous. If a power (whether legislative or administrative) is exercised on the basis of facts which do not exist and which are patently erroneous, such exercise of power will stand vitiated. (See commissioner of Income-tax v. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. (AIR 1984 SC 1182) . The effect of several decisions on the question of jurisdiction has been summed up by Grahame Aldous and John Alder in their book ""Applications for Judicial Review, Law and Practice"" thus: ""There is a general presumption against ousting the jurisdiction of the courts, so that statutory provisions which purport to exclude judicial review are construed restrictively. There are, however, certain areas of governmental activity, national security being the paradig, which the courts regard themselves as incompetent to investigate, beyond an initial decision as to whether the government’s claim is bona fide. In this kind of non-justiciable area judicial review is not entirely excluded, but very limited. It has also been said that powers conferred by the Royal Prerogative are inherently unreviewable but since the speeches of the House of Lords in council of civil Service Unions v. Minister for the civil Service this is doubtful. Lords Diplock, Scaman and. Roskili appeared to agree that there is no general distinction between powers, based upon whether their source is statutory or prerogative but that judicial review can be limited by the subject matter of a particular power, in that case national security. May prerogative powers are in fact concerned with sensitive, non justiciable areas, for example, foreign affairs, but some are reviewable in principle, including the prerogatives relating to the civil service where national security is not involved. Another non\027justiciable power is the Attorney General’s prerogative to decide whether to institute legal proceedings on behalf of the public interest.""  Page 14 of 15 (Also see Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (LR (1968) AC 997). The court will be slow to interfere in such matters relating to administrative functions unless decision is tainted by any vulnerability enumerated above; like illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. Whether action falls within any of the categories has to be established. Mere assertion in that regard would not be sufficient. The famous case commonly known as ""The Wednesbury’s case"" is treated as the landmark so far as laying down various basic principles relating to judicial review of administrative or statutory direction. Before summarizing the substance of the principles laid down therein we shall refer to the passage from the judgment of Lord Greene in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corpn. (KB at p. 229: All ER p. 682). It reads as follows: ""\005\005It is true that discretion must be exercised reasonably. Now what does that mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology used in relation to exercise of statutory discretions often use the word ’unreasonable’ in a rather comprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is frequently used as a general description of the things that must not be done. For instance, a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law. He must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is said, to be acting ’unreasonably’ . Similarly, there may be something so absurd that no sensible person could even dream that it lay within the powers the authority. . . . In another, it is taking into consideration extraneous matters. It is unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith; and in fact, all these things run into one another."" Lord Greene also observed (KB p.230: All ER p.683) ""\005..it must be proved to be unreasonable in the sense that the court considers it to be a decision that no reasonable body can come to. It is not what the court considers unreasonable The effect of the legislation is not to set up the court as an arbiter of the correctness of one view over another."" (emphasis supplied) Therefore, to arrive at a decision on ""reasonableness"" the Court has to find out if the administrator has left out relevant factors or taken into account irrelevant factors. The decision of the administrator must have been within the four corners of the law, and not one which no sensible person could have reasonably arrived at, having regard to the above principles, and must have been a bona fide one. The decision could be  Page 15 of 15 one of many choices open to the authority but it was for that authority to decide upon the choice and not for the Court to substitute its view. The principles of judicial review of administrative action were further summarized in 1985 by Lord Diplock in CCSU case as illegality, procedural impropriety and irrationality. He said more grounds could in future become available, including the doctrine of proportionality which was a principle followed by certain other members of the European Economic Community. Lord Diplock observed in that case as follows: ""\005\005.Judicial review has I think, developed to a stage today when, without reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first ground I would call ’illegality’, the second ’irrationality’ and the third ’procedural impropriety’. That is not to say that further development on a case\027by\027case basis may not in course of time add further grounds. I have in mind particularly the possible adoption in the future of the principle of ’proportionality’ which is recognized in the administrative law of several of our fellow members of the European Economic Community."" Lord Diplock explained ""irrationality"" as follows: ""By ’irrationality’ I mean what can by now be succinctly referred to as Wednesbury unreasonableness’. It applies to a decision which is to outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it."" In other words, to characterize a decision of the administrator as ""irrational"" the Court has to hold, on material, that it is a decision ""so outrageous"" as to be in total defiance of logic or moral standards. Adoption of ""proportionality"" into administrative law was left for the future. These principles have been noted in aforesaid terms in Union of India and Anr. v. C. Ganayutham (1997 [7] SCC 463). In essence, the test is to see whether there is any infirmity in the decision making process and not in the decision itself. (See Indian Railways Construction Co. Ltd. v. Ajay Kumar (2003 (4) SCC 579). Looked at from the aforesaid angle, the judgment of the High Court does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference. The appeal is dismissed."

BALASUBRAMANYAN,"JUDGMENT: J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP(C) No.13997 of 2005) P.K. BALASUBRAMANYAN, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. This appeal by the State of Maharashtra and the Officers of the State Excise Department challenges an interim order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench, in a Writ Petition filed by the respondents herein. Respondent No.1 is a partnership firm and respondent No.2 is a partner therof. Respondent No.1 is engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of Indian made foreign liquor (hereinafter described as ""IMFL"") and holder of a wholesale licence under the State Government in Form PLL as per the Maharashtra Distillation of Spirit and Manufacture of Potable Liquor Rules, 1966. The said Rules are made under the Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949. Respondent No.1 did not own a distillery and was not manufacturing rectified spirit and extra neutral alcohol which it required for manufacture of IMFL. Respondent No. 1 had to purchase rectified spirit and extra neutral alcohol from distilleries owned by others. For possession and use of rectified spirit including the extra neutral alcohol, license was required in Form R.S.II prescribed under the Bombay Rectified Spirit Rules, 1951. The manufacture and sale of IMFL is supposed to take place under the supervision of the staff of the State Excise Department as provided in Rule 12(2) of the Bombay Rectified Spirit Rules, 1951. As per Rule 17 (12) of the Maharashtra Distillation of Spirit and Manufacture of Potable Liquor Rules, 1966 and as per condition No. 1 of the PLL license obtained thereunder, Respondent No.1 as licensee, had to pay the cost of the supervisory staff to the State in terms of Section 58A of the Bombay Prohibition Act. 3. As it is elsewhere, in the State of Maharashtra also, under Section 12 of the Bombay Prohibition Act, manufacture of liquor, construction or working of a distillery or brewery, import, export, transport, possession, sale or purchase of liquor are banned. Though, under Section 13 of the Act, the bottling of liquor for sale, consumption or use of liquor is prohibited; under Section 11, the State has taken upon itself the right to permit any of the aforesaid activities in the manner and to the extent provided for, by the provisions of the Act or any Rules,   of 6 Regulations or Orders made in that behalf. Under Section 49 of the Act, the State has the exclusive privilege of importing, exporting, transporting, manufacturing, bottling, selling, buying, possessing or using any intoxicant. For consideration, the State farms out the right to the concerned licensee. The State has made rules in terms of Section 143 of the Act prescribing fees including rent or consideration payable in respect of any privilege, license, permit, pass or authorization granted or issued under the Act. 4. In view of the relevant provisions in the Bombay Rectified Spirit Rules, 1951, the Bombay Rectified Spirit (Transport in Bond) Rules 1951 are made applicable for rectified spirit. The issue of a transport pass is contemplated for the transport of rectified spirit from the distillery to the factory of the user subject to payment of the fee prescribed under Rule 5(2) of the Bombay Rectified Spirit (Transport in Bond) Rules 1951. According to the State, the first respondent was to pay the fee at the rate of Rs.2 per litre for rectified spirit and Rs.3 per litre for extra neutral alcohol obtained by it for manufacture of IMFL. The respondents filed Writ Petition No. 2417 of 2004 in the High Court challenging the notification dated 12.7.1999, impugning rule 5 of the Bombay Rectified Spirit (Transport in Bond) Rules 1951 and the fee prescribed imposed on them under the Bombay Rectified Spirit (Transport in Bond) Rules 1951. The challenge was mainly based on a decision of the Bombay High Court in Vam Organic Chemicals Limited Vs. State of Maharashtra, Writ Petition No. 2275 of 2000. It was their plea that the decision in Vam Organic Chemicals Limited covered the position regarding the fee sought to be collected from the Respondent No.1 and the demand was liable to be quashed for the reasons stated in Vam Organic Chemicals Limited. The respondents also sought an interim order of stay of the demand pending disposal of the Writ Petition. They pointed out that in a number of other cases including a case of their own relating to a previous demand, interim orders of stay had been granted and that even in the petition for special leave to appeal against the decision in Vam Organic Chemicals Ltd. (supra) being SLP (C) No. 12180 of 2001, filed in the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court has ordered Vam Organic Chemicals Limited, a licensee similarly situated, only to file an undertaking that in case the appeal is allowed by the Supreme Court, Vam Organic Chemicals Limited would satisfy the liability as per law and as determined by the Supreme Court within the time fixed by the Supreme Court. The prayer was opposed by the State. The High Court granted an interim order staying the recovery of the fee on the strength of the decision in Vam Organic Chemicals Limited and the interim order granted by this Court in the appeal from that decision. 5. In its counter affidavit, the State had indicated that the position of the first respondent who does not manufacture rectified spirit for its own consumption was different from the case of Vam Organic Chemicals Limited and that the decision therein or the interim order made in appeal therefrom, does not enable the respondents herein to contend that an interim order as sought for by them should be granted by the Court. It was also submitted by the State that there was a stay as regards earlier years and if during the pendency of the  Page 3 of 6 Writ Petition the liability to pay the fee now challenged is kept stayed or suspended, in case the Writ Petition were to be dismissed, the accumulated liability of respondent No.1 would be huge and the interests of the State would remain unprotected and in such a situation, the balance of convenience was not in favour of the grant of an interim order of stay, that too unconditional, as has been done by that Court in some cases. The High Court declined to accept the distinction sought to be made by the State between the present case and the case of Vam Organic Chemicals Limited and granted a stay of recovery, merely on an undertaking by the respondents. The appellants have challenged that order of the Division Bench of the High Court dated 20.7.2004 in this appeal. 6. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the case of Vam Organic Chemicals Limited was one where the licensee was a manufacturer of rectified spirit and such manufactured rectified spirit was being used by the manufacturer himself. Learned counsel submitted that the view taken by the High Court in that decision was not correct and that there was every chance of this Court allowing the appeal. But learned counsel submitted that even assuming that the decision in Vam Organic Chemicals Limited case was correct, the same would not cover the case of the respondents since the first respondent did not have a license to manufacture rectified spirit and respondent No.1 was not a licensee which manufactured rectified spirit and consumed it for its own purpose of manufacturing IMFL. Learned counsel submitted that the fact that the first respondent purchased rectified spirit or extra neutral alcohol from others and transported it to its premises for the purpose of manufacturing IMFL was a clear distinguishing feature and the first respondent had necessarily to pay the fee under the Bombay Rectified Spirit (Transport in Bond) Rules 1951. The State had the power to make the relevant Rules and to impose the impugned fee. There was no prima facie case made out by the respondents for the grant of an unconditional order of stay in respect of the fee to be paid by the first respondent. Learned counsel reminded the Court of the observations of this Court that a Government cannot run on securities and that in cases involving revenue, interim orders should be passed with care and caution and only on appropriate conditions. Learned counsel submitted that the right to trade in IMFL was a mere privilege granted to the licensee by the State. 7. Learned counsel for respondents, on the other hand, submitted that the case put forward by the respondents was squarely covered by the decision in Vam Organic Chemicals Limited and there was no justification in interfering with the interim order passed by the High Court especially in the context of the order passed by this Court in the appeal from the decision in Vam Organic Chemicals Limited. Learned counsel submitted that the undertaking to be given by the respondents was adequate to protect the interests of the State. It is submitted that the fee impugned was not an impost on potable alcohol, but on rectified spirit and the State has no competence to impose such a levy. Learned counsel submitted that various Writ Petitions were pending in the High Court and their final disposal was being delayed only because of the attempt of the State to  Page 4 of 6 stall their hearing. There was no justification in filing an appeal only against the interim order in their case when similar orders have been passed in various other writ petitions filed in the High Court. 8. In reply, learned counsel for the State submitted that substantial amounts are outstanding from such licensees and it would be appropriate if this Court passes an order that protects the interests of both sides. The State can then move the High Court for vacation of the orders in similar cases that are distinguishable from the case of Vam Organic Chemicals Limited. 9. Prima facie, we find some merit in the argument that the decision in Vam Organic Chemicals Limited may be distinguishable from cases where the licensee himself does not manufacture the rectified spirit. Here, rectified spirit is not manufactured by the first respondent and such spirit is not being used captively in its own premises for manufacture of IMFL. Respondent No.1 is purchasing rectified spirit or extra neutral alcohol from other manufactures and getting it transported to its own premises for manufacturing and bottling IMFL. This factual distinction apart, we have to keep in mind that the right to trade in liquor is only a privilege farmed out by the State. Article 47 of the Constitution of India clearly casts a duty on the State at least to reduce the consumption of liquor in the State gradually leading to prohibition itself. It appears to be right to point out that the time has come for the States and the Union Government to seriously think of taking steps to achieve the goal set by Article 47 of the Constitution of India. It is a notorious fact, of which we can take judicial notice, that more and more of the younger generation in this country is getting addicted to liquor. It has not only become a fashion to consume it but it has also become an obsession with very many. Surely, we do not need an indolent nation. Why the State in the face of Article 47 of the Constitution of India should encourage, that too practically unrestrictedly, the trade in liquor is something that it is difficult to appreciate. The only excuse for the State for not following the mandate of Article 47 of the Constitution is that huge revenue is generated by this trade and such revenue is being used for meeting the financial needs of the State. What is more relevant here is to notice that the monopoly in the trade is with the State and it is only a privilege that a licensee has in the matter of manufacturing and vending liquor. 10. It is pointed out by learned counsel for the appellants that even in the conditions attached to the license, there is an undertaking by the licensee to pay the fees as demanded. It is his submission that there was no reason to water down that obligation by way of an interim order when an attempt is made to challenge the very imposition of the fee which a licensee had agreed to pay in the first instance. We see some force in the submission, but have to balance it with the plea that the State has no power to impose such a levy. We have also to take note of the fact that after all, any amount paid to the State, could be adjusted either towards future liability or directed to be refunded by the State in case the challenge of the licensee succeeds in the Writ Petition when it is finally heard and decided. The only purpose for which the State undertakes liquor trade, notwithstanding the mandate of Article 47 of the Constitution of India, is the revenue that it generates.  Page 5 of 6 This aspect also cannot be lost sight of while considering the balance of convenience in cases where a liquor licensee seeks an interim order staying the fulfillment of his obligation to pay all the fees or other charges demanded from him as such a licensee. There is also merit in the submission that in view of the long years it takes for a Writ Petition to be decided finally, the licensee himself would find it an onerous burden to pay the fees for years together in case his challenge to the levy is ultimately rejected. We are therefore satisfied that the High Court was not justified in passing in practical terms, an unconditional interim order of stay as sought for by the respondents. The High Court should have paid a little more attention to the interests of the State and the consequences arising out of its order staying the payment of the fee merely on an undertaking by the licensee to pay it in case at a future point of time he is found liable to pay the same. It is trite that Government cannot run on undertakings. It has, therefore, become necessary to interfere with the order of the High Court, though normally, this Court would be reluctant, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, to interfere with interim orders made in pending writ petitions. 11. Then the question is what can be an appropriate order in the case on hand. We feel that the interests of both would be protected if we were to order that the licensee is to pay 50 per cent of the license fee payable and that it should give an undertaking to pay the balance 50 per cent in case ultimately the Writ Petition is decided against it, within the time fixed by the High court. This, as we see it, would balance the equities and afford protection to the interests of the State and the interests of the licensee. It would save the licensee from meeting the entire liability here and now pending disposal of his challenge to the levy and at the same time would not make his obligation too onerous, in case ultimately, he is found not entitled to succeed in his challenge in the Writ Petition. This would also enable the Government to realize a part of the revenue which alone appears to be the motive in permitting the trade in liquor notwithstanding the mandate of Article 47 of the Constitution of India. Thus, on a balancing of the interests of both parties in the background of the nature of the trade and the directive principle of State Policy in that behalf, we are satisfied that the order of the High Court calls for interference. 12. We therefore allow this appeal and setting aside the order of the High Court order that if the respondents pay one-half of the license fee payable by the respondents and as demanded of them and give an undertaking that they will pay the balance 50% of the levy within the time fixed by the High Court, if the writ petition were to be dismissed, the recovery of the licence fee payable as per the impugned notification will be kept in abeyance until the disposal of the writ petition by the High Court. The respondents are given three months time from today to file a modified undertaking and to deposit 50 per cent of the license fee payable for the Excise Year 2005-2006. The respondents would be liable to pay 50 per cent of the license fee for the subsequent years on or before the thirty-first of December of that year and to file undertakings in the subsequent years until the Writ Petition is heard and finally decided by the High Court. If  Page 6 of 6 the respondents fail to make the deposit and to file the undertaking as indicated above, the appellants will be free to take all steps that are permissible under law for recovery of the entire fee due from the respondents as may be demanded from them in accordance with the relevant rules. In case the respondents succeed in their challenge in the writ petition, the State will be liable to refund the amount paid with interest thereon at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of payment till the date of refund. The amount will be refunded within two months of the allowing of the writ petition unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, regarding the adjustm","JUDGMENT: J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP(C) No.13997 of 2005) P.K.

Page 5 of 6 This aspect also cannot be lost sight of while considering the balance of convenience in cases where a liquor licensee seeks an interim order staying the fulfillment of his obligation to pay all the fees or other charges demanded from him as such a licensee. There is also merit in the submission that in view of the long years it takes for a Writ Petition to be decided finally, the licensee himself would find it an onerous burden to pay the fees for years together in case his challenge to the levy is ultimately rejected. We are therefore satisfied that the High Court was not justified in passing in practical terms, an unconditional interim order of stay as sought for by the respondents. The High Court should have paid a little more attention to the interests of the State and the consequences arising out of its order staying the payment of the fee merely on an undertaking by the licensee to pay it in case at a future point of time he is found liable to pay the same. It is trite that Government cannot run on undertakings. It has, therefore, become necessary to interfere with the order of the High Court, though normally, this Court would be reluctant, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, to interfere with interim orders made in pending writ petitions. 11. Then the question is what can be an appropriate order in the case on hand. We feel that the interests of both would be protected if we were to order that the licensee is to pay 50 per cent of the license fee payable and that it should give an undertaking to pay the balance 50 per cent in case ultimately the Writ Petition is decided against it, within the time fixed by the High court. This, as we see it, would balance the equities and afford protection to the interests of the State and the interests of the licensee. It would save the licensee from meeting the entire liability here and now pending disposal of his challenge to the levy and at the same time would not make his obligation too onerous, in case ultimately, he is found not entitled to succeed in his challenge in the Writ Petition. This would also enable the Government to realize a part of the revenue which alone appears to be the motive in permitting the trade in liquor notwithstanding the mandate of Article 47 of the Constitution of India. Thus, on a balancing of the interests of both parties in the background of the nature of the trade and the directive principle of State Policy in that behalf, we are satisfied that the order of the High Court calls for interference. 12. We therefore allow this appeal and setting aside the order of the High Court order that if the respondents pay one-half of the license fee payable by the respondents and as demanded of them and give an undertaking that they will pay the balance 50% of the levy within the time fixed by the High Court, if the writ petition were to be dismissed, the recovery of the licence fee payable as per the impugned notification will be kept in abeyance until the disposal of the writ petition by the High Court. The respondents are given three months time from today to file a modified undertaking and to deposit 50 per cent of the license fee payable for the Excise Year 2005-2006. The respondents would be liable to pay 50 per cent of the license fee for the subsequent years on or before the thirty-first of December of that year and to file undertakings in the subsequent years until the Writ Petition is heard and finally decided by the High Court. If  Page 6 of 6 the respondents fail to make the deposit and to file the undertaking as indicated above, the appellants will be free to take all steps that are permissible under law for recovery of the entire fee due from the respondents as may be demanded from them in accordance with the relevant rules. In case the respondents succeed in their challenge in the writ petition, the State will be liable to refund the amount paid with interest thereon at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of payment till the date of refund. The amount will be refunded within two months of the allowing of the writ petition unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, regarding the adjustm"
25,Appeal (crl.) 229 of 2003,Ghapoo Yadav & Ors.,State of M.P.,17/02/2003,SHIVARAJ V. PATIL & ARIJIT PASAYAT,"J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (CRL.) NO.4782/2002) ARIJIT PASAYAT J. Leave granted. Appellants (hereinafter referred to as ’the accused’ by their respective names) question legality of the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court dated 18.4.2001, upholding their conviction for offences punishable under Sections 148 and 302 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short ’the IPC’) and the sentence of rigorous imprisonment for three years and fine of Rs.2,000/- with default stipulation, and imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.5,000/- with default stipulation respectively. Factual scenario as described by the prosecution is essentially as follows: Lekhram (PW-2) and Gopal (hereinafter referred to as ’the deceased’) were sons of Ramlal (PW-1). Accused Gapoo Yadav is the father of accused Janku, Kewal and Mangal Singh. Accused Sunder is the nephew of accused Gapoo. Deceased, the witnesses and the accused belonged to the same village and there was land dispute between them. On the request made by Ramlal (PW-1), measurement of the land was done by the revenue authority. On the basis of the said measurement, it was found that land belonging to accused Mangal Singh was in the possession of Ramlal (PW-1) and over the said land a berry tree existed. Though, initially the tree was in possession of Ramlal, after measurement he parted with possession thereof. Said tree was cut by the family members of Ramlal (PW-1) a day prior to the incident for which deceased had altercation with the accused persons. On the date of incident i.e. 9.6.1986 there were altercations between the accused persons and the deceased, his brother Lekhram and father Ramlal. Accused Janku enquired from the deceased as to why they were cutting the tree. Lekhram responded that it was cut three days prior to the incident as the tree belonged to them and was planted by their family members. Deceased claimed that he had not cut the tree. This led to altercations and scuffles amongst them and the accused persons assaulted deceased, which   of 4 resulted a fracture of his leg. When Ramlal and Lekhram went to save him, the accused persons ran towards them threateningly. Ramlal and Lekhram fled away from the place of incident, and returned later on with the other villagers. They took the deceased who was then grasping for breath on a cot to Maharajpur Police Station. Information was given by the deceased to the police at 8.45 p.m. He was sent for treatment and was examined by Dr. R.K. Chaturvedi (PW-3). On examination he found 7 injuries on his body. His dying declaration was recorded. Later on, deceased took his last breath on 10.6.1986 at 2.00 a.m. Dr. Chaturvedi sent the intimation of death to the Police Station. Though initially case was registered under Section 307 IPC, same was converted to one under Section 302 IPC. Port mortem was conducted by Dr. D.N. Adhikari (PW-6). Investigation was undertaken and on completion thereof charge sheet was filed indicating alleged commission of offences punishable under Sections 147, 148 and 302 read with Section 149 IPC. The case was committed to the Court of Sessions, and finally charges were framed under Sections 148 and 302 read with Section 149 IPC. Accused persons pleaded innocence and claimed false implication. On consideration of the evidence on record, the Trial Court found that the accused persons were guilty and accordingly convicted and sentenced them as aforenoted. It is to be noted that apart from the evidence of the two eye witnesses, reliance was also placed on the dying declaration (Ex.P-1) recorded by Dr. Chaturvedi (PW-3). In appeal, the conviction and consequential sentences imposed were upheld. Though, in support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellants attacked the findings recorded, ultimately he confined his arguments to the question relating to nature of the offence. He further conceded that if the factual findings as recorded are affirmed then Sections 148 and 149 would have application. In our view, the approach is well founded because the Trial Court and the High Court having analysed the evidence in detail, concluded that accused persons were culprits. It was the stand of the learned counsel for the appellants that the injuries sustained by the deceased were in course of sudden quarrel, without pre-meditation and without cruel intents and, therefore, Section 302 IPC was not applicable. According to him, Section 302 IPC cannot be applied even if the prosecution case is accepted in toto, and Exception 4 to Section 300 is clearly applicable. In response, learned counsel appearing for the State of Madhya Pradesh submitted that it is a case to which Section 302 has clear application, and the courts below have rightly applied it along with Sections 148 and 149 IPC. The question is about applicability of Exception 4 to Section 300, IPC. For bringing in its operation it has to be established that the act was committed without premeditation, in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel without the offender having taken undue advantage and not having acted in a cruel or unusual manner. The Fourth Exception of Section 300, IPC covers acts  Page 3 of 4 done in a sudden fight. The said exception deals with a case of prosecution not covered by the first exception, after which its place would have been more appropriate. The exception is founded upon the same principle, for in both there is absence of premeditation. But, while in the case of Exception 1 there is total deprivation of self-control, in case of Exception 4, there is only that heat of passion which clouds men’s sober reason and urges them to deeds which they would not otherwise do. There is provocation in Exception 4 as in Exception 1; but the injury done is not the direct consequence of that provocation. In fact Exception 4 deals with cases in which notwithstanding that a blow may have been struck, or some provocation given in the origin of the dispute or in whatever way the quarrel may have originated, yet the subsequent conduct of both parties puts them in respect of guilt upon equal footing. A ’sudden fight’ implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. The homicide committed is then clearly not traceable to unilateral provocation, nor in such cases could the whole blame be placed on one side. For if it were so, the Exception more appropriately applicable would be Exception 1. There is no previous deliberation or determination to fight. A fight suddenly takes place, for which both parties are more or less to be blamed. It may be that one of them starts it, but if the other had not aggravated it by his own conduct it would not have taken the serious turn it did. There is then mutual provocation and aggravation, and it is difficult to apportion the share of blame which attaches to each fighter. The help of Exception 4 can be invoked if death is caused (a) without premeditation, (b) in a sudden fight; (c) without the offender’s having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner; and (d) the fight must have been with the person killed. To bring a case within Exception 4 all the ingredients mentioned in it must be found. It is to be noted that the ’fight’ occurring in Exception 4 to Section 300, IPC is not defined in the IPC. It takes two to make a fight. Heat of passion requires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this case, the parties have worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal altercation in the beginning. A fight is a combat between two and more persons whether with or without weapons. It is not possible to enunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts of each case. For the application of Exception 4, it is not sufficient to show that there was a sudden quarrel and there was no premeditation. It must further be shown that the offender has not taken undue advantage or acted in cruel or unusual manner. The expression ’undue advantage’ as used in the provision means ’unfair advantage’. In the case at hand, out of the seven injuries, only injury No.2 was held to be of grievous nature, which was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death of the deceased. The infliction of the injuries, and their nature proves the intention of the accused appellants, but causing of such injuries cannot be termed to be either in a cruel or unusual manner for not availing the benefit of Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC. After the injuries were inflicted the injured has fallen down, but there is no material to show that thereafter any injury was inflicted when he was in helpless condition. The assaults were made at random. Even the previous altercations were verbal and not physicals. It is not the case of the prosecution that the  Page 4 of 4 accused appellants had come prepared and armed for attacking the deceased. The previous disputes over land do not appear to have assumed characteristics of physical combat. This goes to show that in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel followed by a fight the accused persons had caused injuries on the deceased, but had not acted in cruel or unusual manner. That being so, Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC is clearly applicable. The fact situation bears great similarity to those in Sukhbir Singh v. State of Haryana (2002 (3) SCC 327). Appellants are to be convicted under Section 304 Part I, IPC and custodial sentence of 10 years and fine as was imposed by the Trial Court would meet the ends of justice.

These civil appeals and transfer applications involve a common question as regards the legal right of regularization of the Respondents in services, although appointed for a fixed period in a project and, thus, are being disposed of by this common judgment. We would notice the factual matrix of the matter from Civil Appeal No. 7051 of 2002. The First Respondent was appointed as an Assistant Computer Instructor. Mehar Chand Polytechnic, Jalandhar, undertook a Community Polytechnic Project, a scheme issued by the Ministry of Human Resources Development, Government of India. The Central Government issued ""provisional norms"" for implementing the scheme. Specific amounts by way of both recurring and non-recurring expenses used to be granted by the Central Government. Under the head ’non-recurring’ expenses, a sum of Rs. Ten lacs was earmakred for acquisition of tools and equipments for five extension centres. As regards recurring nature of expenditure, Instructor were to be appointed on a consolidated amount of Rs.1,500/- or Rs.2,000/- as the case may be. The total amount of recurring expenditure was fixed at Rs. Seven lacs only. In the circular letter, it was, inter alia, stated : ""The expenditure shown above are at the maximum limit and the actual expenditure on each item should be limited to the bare minimum. The payment of salary/honorarium should also be limited considering the nature of duties and responsibilities entrusted and no regular staff should be appointed till the final guideline document is approved and necessary instructions are intimated. Engagement of Part-time/Full-Time staff should be based on the actual requirement."" It was directed that the total wages payable to the employees should   of 9 not exceed 2/3rd of the amount of the grant. It was further stated that even deputation should not be encouraged. By a circular letter dated 07.04.1998, the Technical Teachers’ Training Institute, inter alia, issued the following directions to the Principal of the Polytechnic : ""2. Those who have been taken on deputation from the Polytechnic to Community Polytechnic, their salaries can be protected but total wage salaries of whole CP Scheme should not in any circumstances exceed 2/3rd of the allotted recurring grant. As such CPs must be careful in taking the person on deputation and in no circumstances, two persons \026 Project Officer and Asstt. Project Officer or both should not be taken on deputation. 3. As already indicated, as per the guidelines of Govt. of India which have already been circulated, persons can be taken on deputation or on contract/tenure basis. But certain cases have come to the notice of undersigned where CP have appointed PO or APO or both on scale basis. As this is a plan and project scheme of GOI, taking the person on the scale is not permissible as per the instructions of GOI, MHRD and also this is not permissible to give them revised scales as per the 5th Pay Commission of Central Government or 4th Pay Commission of respective State Government. As such, it is intimated that under no circumstances, you should give the revised scales to the persons working under CP/CDRT Scheme unless clear-cut guidelines are issued by GOI, MHRD."" ""Please refer to your application dated 31.7.1992 for the post of Asstt. Computer Instructor at this wing. Indisputably, no post was created. The objective of the project was not to provide employment but to give some input to the people at the rural level by educating them so as to enable them to utilize their lands more beneficially. The project although lasted for a long time, but visualized to be of limited duration, by reason thereof no substantive appointment was to be given. The project was to be manned by a few persons on a temporary basis. The First Respondent herein was appointed in the said project in terms of the said policy decision of the Central Government. One of the appointment letters issued to the First Respondent reads as under : You are hereby offered the post of Asstt. Computer Instructor on purely temporary basis w.e.f. 3.8.1992 on a consolidated salary of Rs.1500/- per month for a period of one year i.e. upto 31.7.1993. 3. Your services can be terminated by giving 15 days notice on either side."" It is not the case of the Respondents that prior to issuance of the said offer of appointment any vacancy existed or the same was notified to the Employment Exchange. It is furthermore not their case that they were recruited in terms of the statutory rules and/or upon compliance of the  Page 3 of 9 requirements envisaged under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. It is also not their case that prior to their appointments any advertisement was issued enabling the eligible candidates to file applications therefor or the vacancies were notified to the Employment Exchange. They made a representation for grant of scale of pay, which was rejected. A writ petition was filed before the Punjab & Haryana High Court. An interim order was passed directing the Central Government to put them on a regular scale of pay. While considering the matter, the officials of the Directorate of Technical Education, Punjab, sought for an information as to whether the Respondents had obtained a certificate in computer training from a recognized institute. A resolution to the said effect was taken by the appropriate committee. Pursuant to the said resolution, the said Respondent was asked as to whether she possessed the requisite qualification, to which she stated that she had obtained a certificate from M/s Babbage Institute of Computer Studies, which although was registered with the Registrar of Firms and Societies but was not recognized by any competent authority. The High Court by reason of the impugned judgment allowed the writ petition directing the appellant to create suitable posts as also consider the question of regularization of her services to the said post within three months, directing : ""\005The petitioner has been in position since the year 1992. The post is still needed. In this situation, we consider it appropriate to direct that the petitioner’s case for regularization on the post held by her shall be considered within three months. The respondents shall fix an appropriate scale of pay and place her in that scale. The emoluments shall not be below Rs.5500/- per month as mentioned above."" A limited noticed was issued by this Court confined only to the question as to whether the High Court could direct for regularization of services of the Respondent. Mr. Sunil Gupta, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants, submitted that in view of the fact that the Respondent was appointed in a project, the High Court could not have directed regularization of her services. Such a direction, the learned counsel contended, is contrary to the decisions of this Court in Delhi Development Horticulture Employees’ Union v. Delhi Administration, Delhi and Others [(1992) 4 SCC 99], State of Himachal Pradesh v. Nodha Ram and Others [AIR 1997 SC 1445] as also a recent Constitution Bench decision in Secretary, State of Karnataka and Others v. Umadevi and Others [(2006) 4 SCC 1]. Mr. T.L. Iyer, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents, on the other hand, urged that keeping view the fact that the scheme was in operation since 1979, and the number of such Community Polytechnics has gone up throughout India, the Union of India, being a model employer, could not have taken recourse to arbitrary exercise of power by imposing such harsh conditions of service. Putting of long years of service, according to the learned counsel, itself would be sufficient for directing regularization of service. Public employment is a facet of right to equality envisaged under Article 16 of the Constitution of India. The State although is a model employer, its right to create posts and recruit people therefor emanates from the statutes or statutory rules and/or rules framed under the proviso  Page 4 of 9 appended to Article 309 of the Constitution of India. The recruitment rules are framed with a view to give equal opportunity to all the citizens of India entitled for being considered for recruitment in the vacant posts. The Parliament for giving effect to the provisions of the Article 16 of the Constitution enacted the Employment Exchanges (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959. The statutes and the statutory rules framed by the Union of India and other States also invariably require issuance of a public notices so as to enable all eligible candidates to file applications thereof. The Constitution and/or statutes or statutory rules do not make any distinction between post and posts. The recruitment process for all posts is the same. In a large number of cases, this Court noticed that the holders of public posts had been making recruitments in total violation of the recruitment process. In regard to the question of regularization also, different orders had been passed by different benches. Some benches pointed out that the equality doctrine enshrined in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India had been grossly violated by the authorities, and the provisions of recruitment rules were given a complete go by. Even the beneficent provisions of the reservation applicable to the backward classes of people had not been adhered to. This Court also noticed a growing tendency of giving backdoor appointments to a large section of employees on ad hoc basis or on daily wages. With a view to give a quietus to the controversies arising out of differences in opinion expressed in different decisions, in Secretary, State of Karnataka and Others v. Umadevi and Others [(2006) 4 SCC 44], a three Judge Bench of this Court thought it fit to refer the matter for authoritative pronouncements by a Constitution Bench, stating : ""1. Apart from the conflicting opinions between the three-Judge Bench decisions in Ashwani Kumar v. State of Bihar; State of Haryana v. Piara Singh; and Dharwad District PWD Literate Daily Wage Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka on the one hand and State of H.P. v. Suresh Kumar Verma; State of Punjab v. Surinder Kumar; and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka on the other, which have been brought out in one of the judgments under appeal of the Karnataka High Court in State of Karnataka v. H. Ganesh Rao, decided on 1.6.2001 the learned Additional Solicitor General urged that the scheme for regularization is repugnant to Articles 16(4), 309, 320 and 335 of the Constitution and, therefore, these cases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned Judges (Constitution Bench). 2. On the other hand, Mr. M.C. Bhandare, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for the employees urged that such a scheme for regularization is consistent with the provisions of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. 3. Mr. V. Lakshmi Narayan, learned counsel appearing in CCs Nos.109-498 of 2003, has filed the GO dated 19.7.2002 and submitted that the orders have already been implemented. 4. After having found that there is conflict of opinion between the three-Judge Bench decisions of this Court, we are of the view that  Page 5 of 9 these cases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned Judges. 5. Let these matters be placed before the Hon’ble the Chief Justice for appropriate orders."" The Constitution Bench of this Court while answering some of the said questions in no uncertain terms held that any appointment made in violation of the statute or in derogation of the equality clause contained in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution would be void and of no effect. It was opined that such persons who had obtained such illegal appointments were not entitled to claim regularization. We may at this juncture notice that way back in 1992, a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Delhi Development Horticulture Employees’ Union (supra) observed as under : ""The above figures show that if the resources used for the Jawahar Rozgar Yojna were in their entirety to be used for providing full employment throughout the year, they would have given employment only to a small percentage of the population in need of income, the remaining vast majority being left with no income whatsoever. No fault could, therefore, be found with the limited object of the scheme given the limited resources at the disposal of the State. Those employed under the scheme, therefore, could not ask for more than what the scheme intended to give them. To get an employment under such scheme and to claim on the basis of the said employment, a right to regularisation, is to frustrate the scheme itself. No court can be a party to such exercise. It is wrong to approach the problems of those employed under such schemes with a view to providing them with full employment and guaranteeing equal pay for equal work. These concepts, in the context of such schemes are both unwarranted and misplaced. They will do more harm than good by depriving the many of the little income that they may get to keep them from starvation. They would benefit a few at the cost of the many starving poor for whom the schemes are meant. That would also force the State to wind up the existing schemes and forbid them from introducing the new ones, for want of resources. This is not to say that the problems of the unemployed deserve no consideration or sympathy. This is only to emphasise that even among the unemployed a distinction exists between those who live below and above the poverty line, those in need of partial and those in need of full employment, the educated and uneducated, the rural and urban unemployed etc."" Yet again in Nodha Ram (supra) in regard to the status of the temporary employees employed in the Government project, it was held : ""It is seen that when the project is completed and closed due to non-availability of funds, the employees have to go along with its closure. The High Court was not right in giving the direction to regularise them or to continue them in other places. No vested right is created in temporary employment. Directions cannot be given to regularise their services in the absence of any existing vacancies nor can directions be given to  Page 6 of 9 the State to create posts in a non-existent establishment. The Court would adopt pragmatic approach in giving directions. The directions would amount to creating of posts and continuing them despite non-availability of the work. We are of the considered view that the directions issued by the High Court are absolutely illegal warranting our interference. The order of the High Court is, therefore, set side."" Strong reliance has been placed by Mr. Iyer in Jacob M. Puthuparambil and Others etc. v. Kerala Water Authority and Others [(1991) 1 SCC 28], for the proposition that even if statutory rules do not operate in the field, direction for regularization is permissible in law. Jacob (supra) was decided in a different fact situation. In that case the employees concerned were working in the erstwhile Public Health Engineering Department. Upon creation of the Kerala Water and Waste Water Authority constituted under Section 3(1) of the Ordinance 14 of 1984 repealed and replaced by Act 14 of 1986, their services were transferred. The cases of regularization of the employees appointed during different periods came up for consideration in the light of Rule 9(a)(i) of the Kerala State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1958 and the Resolution adopted by the Authority in terms thereof. The contention of the employees therein was that they were having been appointed in terms of the Rule 9(1) of the Rules and their names having been called for from the Employment Exchange, the services of those who possessed requisite qualifications, could not be terminated. Clause (iii) of Rule 9 provided for regularization of service of any person appointed under clause (i) of sub-rule (a). A resolution had also been passed by the Authority recommending to the State regularization of the service of the employees recruited in the erstwhile PHED and still working in the Kerala Water Authority. It is in the aforementioned backdrop this Court directed regularization of those who possessed the requisite qualifications. In this case, neither a policy decision was taken by the Central Government nor their existed any rules in this behalf. Although this Court is not directly concerned as to whether such a policy decision could have been taken in view of the provisions contained in Article 309 of the Constitution of India, we may notice that in A. Uma Rani v. Registrar, Cooperative Societies and Others [(2004) 7 SCC 112], this Court opined : ""No regularization is, thus, permissible in exercise of the statutory power conferred under Article 162 of the Constitution if the appointments have been made in contravention of the statutory rules."" Reliance has also been placed by Mr. Iyer on Karnataka State Private College Stop-Gap Lecturers Association etc. v. State of Karnataka and Others [(1992) 2 SCC 29], wherein this Court issued some directions; but while doing so it did not take into consideration the relevant constitutional provisions. It may, however, be noticed that even therein it was opined : ""\005A temporary or ad hoc employee may not have a claim to become permanent without facing selection or being absorbed in accordance with rules but no discrimination can be made for same job on basis of method of recruitment. Such injustice is abhorrent to the constitutional scheme.  Page 7 of 9 Reliance placed by the learned counsel on the said decision is, therefore, misplaced. Reliance has also been placed on State of Haryana and Others v. Piara Singh and Others [(1992) 4 SCC 118]. We need not dilate on the said decision as the same was considered by the Constitution Bench in Umadevi, supra opining that the direction made therein to some extent is inconsistent with the conclusion, stating : ""With respect, the direction made in paragraph 50 of Piara Singh is to some extent inconsistent with the conclusion in paragraph 45 therein. With great respect, it appears to us that the last of the directions clearly runs counter to the constitutional scheme of employment recognized in the earlier part of the decision. Really, it cannot be said that this decision has laid down the law that all ad hoc, temporary or casual employees engaged without following the regular recruitment procedure should be made permanent."" Baseruddin M. Madari and Others v. State of Karnataka and Others [(1995) Supp. 4 SCC 111], whereupon again reliance has again been placed by the Senior Counsel, this Court following the decision in Karnataka State Private College Stop-Gap Lecturers’ Association (supra) did not lay down any law that services of all ad hoc employees are required to be regularized. The Constitution Bench in Umadevi (supra) in regard to the temporary employees clearly opined : ""\005There is no fundamental right in those who have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or on contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in service. As has been held by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a regular appointment could be made only by making appointments consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The right to be treated equally with the other employees employed on daily wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal treatment with those who were regularly employed. That would be treating unequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on to claim a right to be absorbed in service even though they have never been selected in terms of the relevant recruitment rules. The arguments based on Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution are therefore overruled. It was further observed : ""\005The rule of law compels the State to make appointments as envisaged by the Constitution and in the manner we have indicated earlier. In most of these cases, no doubt, the employees had worked for some length of time but this has also been brought about by the pendency of proceedings in tribunals and courts initiated at the instance of the employees. Moreover, accepting an argument of this nature would mean that the State would be permitted to perpetuate an illegality in the matter of public employment and that would be a negation of the constitutional scheme adopted by us, the people of India. It is therefore not possible to accept the argument that there must be a  Page 8 of 9 direction to make permanent all the persons employed on daily wages. When the court is approached for relief by way of a writ, the court has necessarily to ask itself whether the person before it had any legal right to be enforced. Considered in the light of the very clear constitutional scheme, it cannot be said that the employees have been able to establish a legal right to be made permanent even though they have never been appointed in terms of the relevant rules or in adherence of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution."" The respondents did not have legal right to be absorbed in service. They were appointed purely on temporary basis. It has not been shown by them that prior to their appointments, the requirements of the provisions of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution had been complied with. Admittedly, there did not exist any sanctioned post. The project undertaken by the Union of India although continued for some time was initially intended to be a time bound one. It was not meant for generating employment. It was meant for providing technical education to the agriculturalists. In absence of any legal right in the respondents, the High Court, thus, in our considered view, could not have issued a writ of or in the nature of mandamus. In Umadevi (supra), it was stated : ""There have been decisions which have taken the cue from the Dharwad case and given directions for regularization, absorption or making permanent, employees engaged or appointed without following the due process or the rules for appointment. The philosophy behind this approach is seen set out in the recent decision in The Workmen v. Bhurkunda Colliery of Central Coalfields Ltd., though the legality or validity of such an approach has not been independently examined. But on a survey of authorities, the predominant view is seen to be that such appointments did not confer any right on the appointees and that the Court cannot direct their absorption or regularization or re-engagement or making them permanent"" It was further opined : See also State of U.P. v. Neeraj Awasthi and Others [(2006) 1 SCC 667]. Yet again in National Fertilizers Ltd. & Ors. v. Somvir Singh [(2006) 6 SCALE 101], it was held : ""Regularization, furthermore, is not a mode of appointment. If appointment is made without following the Rules, the same being a nullity the question of confirmation of an employee upon the expiry of the purported period of probation would not arise\005"" ""It is true that the Respondents had been working for a long time. It may also be true that they had not been paid wages on a regular scale of pay. But, they did not hold any post. They were, therefore, not entitled to be paid salary on a regular scale of pay. Furthermore, only because the Respondents have worked for some time, the same  Page 9 of 9 by itself would not be a ground for directing regularization of their services in view of the decision of this Court in Uma Devi (supra)."" For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgments cannot be sustained. In view of the fact that limited notice was issued in Civil Appeal Nos.7051 and 7052 of 2002 arising out of S.L.P. (Civil) Nos.11597 and 22493 of 2001, we set aside only that part of the judgment whereby and whereunder the Appellants had been directed to create posts and regularize the services of the Respondents therein. The impugned judgments of the High Court to the aforementioned extent are set aside. In view of our findings aforementioned, the transfer cases are also disposed on the same terms. The appeals are, thus, allowed, to the extent mentioned hereinabove. The parties shall, however, pay and bear their own costs.","J U D G M E N T W I T H CIVIL APPEAL NOS.7052/2002, 6028-30/2004,7505-06/2004 & 2922/2005 AND CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 3436/2006, 3438/2006 & 3437/2006 [Arising out of SLP (Civil) Nos.7925/2004, 8133/2004 & 8154/2004] AND T.C. (Civil) NOS.65-71/2004 T.C. (Civil) No. OF 2006 [Arising out of T.P. (CIVIL) NO.850/2005] S.B. SINHA, J : Delay condoned in S.L.Ps. Leave granted in S.L.Ps. These civil appeals and transfer applications involve a common question as regards the legal right of regularization of the Respondents in services, although appointed for a fixed period in a project and, thus, are being disposed of by this common judgment. We would notice the factual matrix of the matter from Civil Appeal No. 7051 of 2002. The First Respondent was appointed as an Assistant Computer Instructor. Mehar Chand Polytechnic, Jalandhar, undertook a Community Polytechnic Project, a scheme issued by the Ministry of Human Resources Development, Government of India. The Central Government issued ""provisional norms"" for implementing the scheme. Specific amounts by way of both recurring and non-recurring expenses used to be granted by the Central Government. Under the head ’non-recurring’ expenses, a sum of Rs. Ten lacs was earmakred for acquisition of tools and equipments for five extension centres. As regards recurring nature of expenditure, Instructor were to be appointed on a consolidated amount of Rs.1,500/- or Rs.2,000/- as the case may be. The total amount of recurring expenditure was fixed at Rs. Seven lacs only. In the circular letter, it was, inter alia, stated : ""The expenditure shown above are at the maximum limit and the actual expenditure on each item should be limited to the bare minimum. The payment of salary/honorarium should also be limited considering the nature of duties and responsibilities entrusted and no regular staff should be appointed till the final guideline document is approved and necessary instructions are intimated. Engagement of Part-time/Full-Time staff should be based on the actual requirement."" It was directed that the total wages payable to the employees should   of 9 not exceed 2/3rd of the amount of the grant. It was further stated that even deputation should not be encouraged. By a circular letter dated 07.04.1998, the Technical Teachers’ Training Institute, inter alia, issued the following directions to the Principal of the Polytechnic : ""2. Those who have been taken on deputation from the Polytechnic to Community Polytechnic, their salaries can be protected but total wage salaries of whole CP Scheme should not in any circumstances exceed 2/3rd of the allotted recurring grant. As such CPs must be careful in taking the person on deputation and in no circumstances, two persons \026 Project Officer and Asstt. Project Officer or both should not be taken on deputation. 3. As already indicated, as per the guidelines of Govt. of India which have already been circulated, persons can be taken on deputation or on contract/tenure basis. But certain cases have come to the notice of undersigned where CP have appointed PO or APO or both on scale basis. As this is a plan and project scheme of GOI, taking the person on the scale is not permissible as per the instructions of GOI, MHRD and also this is not permissible to give them revised scales as per the 5th Pay Commission of Central Government or 4th Pay Commission of respective State Government. As such, it is intimated that under no circumstances, you should give the revised scales to the persons working under CP/CDRT Scheme unless clear-cut guidelines are issued by GOI, MHRD."" ""Please refer to your application dated 31.7.1992 for the post of Asstt. Computer Instructor at this wing. Indisputably, no post was created. The objective of the project was not to provide employment but to give some input to the people at the rural level by educating them so as to enable them to utilize their lands more beneficially. The project although lasted for a long time, but visualized to be of limited duration, by reason thereof no substantive appointment was to be given. The project was to be manned by a few persons on a temporary basis. The First Respondent herein was appointed in the said project in terms of the said policy decision of the Central Government. One of the appointment letters issued to the First Respondent reads as under : You are hereby offered the post of Asstt. Computer Instructor on purely temporary basis w.e.f. 3.8.1992 on a consolidated salary of Rs.1500/- per month for a period of one year i.e. upto 31.7.1993. 3. Your services can be terminated by giving 15 days notice on either side."" It is not the case of the Respondents that prior to issuance of the said offer of appointment any vacancy existed or the same was notified to the Employment Exchange. It is furthermore not their case that they were recruited in terms of the statutory rules and/or upon compliance of the  Page 3 of 9 requirements envisaged under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. It is also not their case that prior to their appointments any advertisement was issued enabling the eligible candidates to file applications therefor or the vacancies were notified to the Employment Exchange. They made a representation for grant of scale of pay, which was rejected. A writ petition was filed before the Punjab & Haryana High Court. An interim order was passed directing the Central Government to put them on a regular scale of pay. While considering the matter, the officials of the Directorate of Technical Education, Punjab, sought for an information as to whether the Respondents had obtained a certificate in computer training from a recognized institute. A resolution to the said effect was taken by the appropriate committee. Pursuant to the said resolution, the said Respondent was asked as to whether she possessed the requisite qualification, to which she stated that she had obtained a certificate from M/s Babbage Institute of Computer Studies, which although was registered with the Registrar of Firms and Societies but was not recognized by any competent authority. The High Court by reason of the impugned judgment allowed the writ petition directing the appellant to create suitable posts as also consider the question of regularization of her services to the said post within three months, directing : ""\005The petitioner has been in position since the year 1992. The post is still needed. In this situation, we consider it appropriate to direct that the petitioner’s case for regularization on the post held by her shall be considered within three months. The respondents shall fix an appropriate scale of pay and place her in that scale. The emoluments shall not be below Rs.5500/- per month as mentioned above."" A limited noticed was issued by this Court confined only to the question as to whether the High Court could direct for regularization of services of the Respondent. Mr. Sunil Gupta, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants, submitted that in view of the fact that the Respondent was appointed in a project, the High Court could not have directed regularization of her services. Such a direction, the learned counsel contended, is contrary to the decisions of this Court in Delhi Development Horticulture Employees’ Union v. Delhi Administration, Delhi and Others [(1992) 4 SCC 99], State of Himachal Pradesh v. Nodha Ram and Others [AIR 1997 SC 1445] as also a recent Constitution Bench decision in Secretary, State of Karnataka and Others v. Umadevi and Others [(2006) 4 SCC 1]. Mr. T.L. Iyer, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents, on the other hand, urged that keeping view the fact that the scheme was in operation since 1979, and the number of such Community Polytechnics has gone up throughout India, the Union of India, being a model employer, could not have taken recourse to arbitrary exercise of power by imposing such harsh conditions of service. Putting of long years of service, according to the learned counsel, itself would be sufficient for directing regularization of service. Public employment is a facet of right to equality envisaged under Article 16 of the Constitution of India. The State although is a model employer, its right to create posts and recruit people therefor emanates from the statutes or statutory rules and/or rules framed under the proviso  Page 4 of 9 appended to Article 309 of the Constitution of India. The recruitment rules are framed with a view to give equal opportunity to all the citizens of India entitled for being considered for recruitment in the vacant posts. The Parliament for giving effect to the provisions of the Article 16 of the Constitution enacted the Employment Exchanges (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959. The statutes and the statutory rules framed by the Union of India and other States also invariably require issuance of a public notices so as to enable all eligible candidates to file applications thereof. The Constitution and/or statutes or statutory rules do not make any distinction between post and posts. The recruitment process for all posts is the same. In a large number of cases, this Court noticed that the holders of public posts had been making recruitments in total violation of the recruitment process. In regard to the question of regularization also, different orders had been passed by different benches. Some benches pointed out that the equality doctrine enshrined in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India had been grossly violated by the authorities, and the provisions of recruitment rules were given a complete go by. Even the beneficent provisions of the reservation applicable to the backward classes of people had not been adhered to. This Court also noticed a growing tendency of giving backdoor appointments to a large section of employees on ad hoc basis or on daily wages. With a view to give a quietus to the controversies arising out of differences in opinion expressed in different decisions, in Secretary, State of Karnataka and Others v. Umadevi and Others [(2006) 4 SCC 44], a three Judge Bench of this Court thought it fit to refer the matter for authoritative pronouncements by a Constitution Bench, stating : ""1. Apart from the conflicting opinions between the three-Judge Bench decisions in Ashwani Kumar v. State of Bihar; State of Haryana v. Piara Singh; and Dharwad District PWD Literate Daily Wage Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka on the one hand and State of H.P. v. Suresh Kumar Verma; State of Punjab v. Surinder Kumar; and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka on the other, which have been brought out in one of the judgments under appeal of the Karnataka High Court in State of Karnataka v. H. Ganesh Rao, decided on 1.6.2001 the learned Additional Solicitor General urged that the scheme for regularization is repugnant to Articles 16(4), 309, 320 and 335 of the Constitution and, therefore, these cases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned Judges (Constitution Bench). 2. On the other hand, Mr. M.C. Bhandare, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for the employees urged that such a scheme for regularization is consistent with the provisions of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. 3. Mr. V. Lakshmi Narayan, learned counsel appearing in CCs Nos.109-498 of 2003, has filed the GO dated 19.7.2002 and submitted that the orders have already been implemented. 4. After having found that there is conflict of opinion between the three-Judge Bench decisions of this Court, we are of the view that  Page 5 of 9 these cases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned Judges. 5. Let these matters be placed before the Hon’ble the Chief Justice for appropriate orders.""

But on a survey of authorities, the predominant view is seen to be that such appointments did not confer any right on the appointees and that the Court cannot direct their absorption or regularization or re-engagement or making them permanent"" It was further opined : See also State of U.P. v. Neeraj Awasthi and Others [(2006) 1 SCC 667]. Yet again in National Fertilizers Ltd. & Ors. v. Somvir Singh [(2006) 6 SCALE 101], it was held : ""Regularization, furthermore, is not a mode of appointment. If appointment is made without following the Rules, the same being a nullity the question of confirmation of an employee upon the expiry of the purported period of probation would not arise\005"" ""It is true that the Respondents had been working for a long time. It may also be true that they had not been paid wages on a regular scale of pay. But, they did not hold any post. They were, therefore, not entitled to be paid salary on a regular scale of pay. Furthermore, only because the Respondents have worked for some time, the same  Page 9 of 9 by itself would not be a ground for directing regularization of their services in view of the decision of this Court in Uma Devi (supra)."" For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgments cannot be sustained. In view of the fact that limited notice was issued in Civil Appeal Nos.7051 and 7052 of 2002 arising out of S.L.P. (Civil) Nos.11597 and 22493 of 2001, we set aside only that part of the judgment whereby and whereunder the Appellants had been directed to create posts and regularize the services of the Respondents therein. The impugned judgments of the High Court to the aforementioned extent are set aside. In view of our findings aforementioned, the transfer cases are also disposed on the same terms. The appeals are, thus, allowed, to the extent mentioned hereinabove. The parties shall, however, pay and bear their own costs."
27,Appeal (civil) 4228-4229 of 1999,"W.P.I.L. Ltd., Ghaziabad","Commissioner of Central Excise, Meerut, U.P.",22/02/2005,Ruma Pal & Arijit Pasayat & C.K. Thakker,"JUDGMENT: JUDGMENT Thakker, J. These appeals have been filed by the appellant against an Order in Original Nos. 123-29 of 1996 passed by the Assistant Commissioner, Central Excise, Division I, Ghaziabad, confirmed by the Commissioner (Appeals), Customs & Central Excise, Ghaziabad and also confirmed by the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi (‘CEGAT’ for short). The case of the appellant is that it is the manufacturer of power driven pumps and parts thereof designed for handling water. The power driven pumps as well as parts thereof which are used for manufacture of pumps have been exempted from levy of excise duty since 1978. Various notifications had been issued from time to time granting exemption to both, i.e. power driven pumps and also parts of power driven pumps which were used in the manufacture of the power driven pumps. Parts of power driven pumps which were not utilized for manufacture of power driven pumps within the factory were, however, outside the purview of exemption and they were subjected to levy of excise duty. According to the appellant, with a view to reducing special exemption notifications and consolidating various exemption notifications, in 1994, the Government rescinded 389 notifications with effect from March 1, 1994 and re-issued a consolidated notification incorporating earlier notifications vide Notification No.46/94 dated March 1, 1994. In the said notification, power driven pumps were shown as an exempted item. Due to inadvertence, however, parts of power driven pumps used in manufacture of pumps within the factory which were all along exempted from 1978 were omitted. But there was no change in the Government policy in 1994 which was in vogue since 1978. The omission was, therefore, brought to the notice of the Government by the industries. The Government was also satisfied and amended the notification No.46/94 dated March 1, 1994 by issuing another notification No.95/94 on April 25, 1994 correcting the mistake and clarifying the position that parts of power driven pumps which were used in manufacture of power driven pumps would also be exempted. According to the appellant, the notification No.95/94 dated April 25, 1994 was thus merely clarificatory in nature and an obvious error or omission which remained while issuing notification No.46/94 on March 1, 1994 was rectified by the subsequent notification No.95/94 on April 25, 1994 and hence it was retrospective in operation. The resultant effect, according to the appellant, was that parts of power driven pumps which were to be utilized for manufacturing power driven pumps within the factory would continue to be exempted from payment of excise duty. Unfortunately, however, show cause notices were issued by the Assistant Collector, Central Excise, Division I, Ghaziabad on October 3, 1994 and October 24, 1994 alleging therein that the appellant had cleared the parts of power driven pumps for use within the factory for the manufacture of   of 5 submersible power driven pumps during the period between 1st March, 1994 and 21st April, 1994 without payment of duty which was subjected to central excise duty. The said item was exempted with effect from April 25, 1994 and the appellant was, therefore, liable to pay excise duty for the intervening period, i.e. 1st March, 1994 and 21st April, 1994. The appellant submitted a reply on October 31, 1994 inter alia contending that it was not liable to pay excise duty. No suppression of facts or mis declaration was alleged against the appellant and the demand was barred by limitation. It was also stated that notification No.95/94 dated April 25, 1994 was retrospective in nature and exemption ought to be considered and granted from March 1, 1994. There was, therefore, no liability on the part of the appellant to pay any amount. The Assistant Commissioner, Central Excise, Division I, Ghaziabad, by an order dated March 31, 1996 confirmed the demand against the appellant and directed it to pay the amount mentioned in the said order. Being aggrieved by that order, the appellant preferred appeals, but the Appellate Authority also confirmed the order passed by the Assistant Commissioner and dismissed the appeals. The appellant preferred appeal before the CEGAT which was also dismissed confirming the orders passed by the authorities below. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. Mr. A.K. Ganguli, learned senior advocate for the appellant submitted that power driven pumps as well as parts thereof had been exempted from payment of excise duty since 1978. It was the consistent practice of the Department and the policy had never been changed. It was also submitted that there was no change of policy even in 1994. What was done by the Government was to reduce the number of special exemption notifications. About 400 such notifications were rescinded with effect from March 1, 1994 and a consolidated notification was issued incorporating earlier notifications by notification No.46/94 on March 1, 1994. In view of the policy since 1978, which was not changed, in 1994, by rescinding several notifications and issuing a consolidated notification exempted items were not made subject matter of payment of excise duty and no demand could be made from the appellant. The Central Government was satisfied about the legitimate grievance voiced by the industries and, accordingly, a notification was issued on April 25, 1994. The subsequent notification was, therefore, merely clarificatory in nature and has to be given retrospective effect. No demand could be made for payment of excise duty for the period between March 1, 1994 and April 21/25, 1994. Mr. Pathak, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the respondent, on the other hand, submitted that the authorities below were right in holding that by notification dated March 1, 1994, parts of power driven pumps were not exempted and the exemption was granted by notification dated April 25, 1994 and hence demand for payment of excise duty for the period between issuance of two notifications was legal, valid and well-founded. It was also argued that the subsequent notification granted benefit in respect of parts of power driven pumps and was not clarificatory in nature. The benefit of the said notification, therefore, could be claimed by the industries only from the date of issuance of notification and not for any period prior to that date. He, therefore, prayed for dismissal of the appeals. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, in our opinion, the submission made on behalf of the appellant is well-founded and must be accepted. In this connection, our attention was invited by the learned counsel for the appellant to various notifications issued by the Central Government from time to time. One such notification was No.57/78 issued on March 1, 1978. It reads as under  Page 3 of 5 ""Power Driven Pumps In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, the Central Government hereby exempts power driven pumps falling under Item No.30A of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 (1 of 1944), and specified in the Table annexed hereto from the whole of the duty of excise leviable thereon. TABLE Power driven pumps primarily designed for handling water, namely : (i) Centrifugal pumps (horizontal or vertical pumps); (ii) Deep tube-well turbine pumps ; (iii) Submersible pumps; and (iv) Asial flow and mixed flow vertical pumps. [vide M.F.(D.R.) Notification No.57/78-C.E., dated 1-3-1978]"" Similar notification was issued on February 10, 1986 being Excise Notification NO.79/1986 as several other notifications. By Excise Notification No.155/86 dated March 1, 1986 relating to specified goods under Chapter 84, it was stated; ""SPECIFIED GOODS [CHAPTER 84] In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-rule (1) of rule 8 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, the Central Government hereby exempts the goods specified in column (3) of the Table hereto annexed and falling under the Heading No. or sub-heading No. of the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 (5 of 1986) specified in the corresponding entry in column (2) of the table, from so much of the duty of excise leviable thereon which is specified in the said Schedule as in the excess of the amount calculated at the rate specified in the corresponding entry in column (4) of the said Table.

(ii) Other power driven pumps Ten per cent ad valorem"" The contention of the appellant, in our opinion, therefore, is well-founded that both power driven pumps as well as parts of power driven pumps used for manufacturing of pumps within the factory were exempted from payment of excise duty. We are also satisfied that notifications were rescinded and consolidated notification was issued on March 1, 1994 with a view to reduce number of notifications. No demand hence could have been made against the appellant in respect of parts of power driven pumps by issuing show cause notices. The submission of the appellant is well-founded that the Government was satisfied about the policy which was in vogue not to impose excise duty on parts of power driven pumps used in the factory premises for manufacture of power driven pumps and to clarify the position, the subsequent notification dated April 25, 1994 was issued. This is also clear if one reads at both the notifications Nos. 46/94 dated March 1, 1994 and 56/94 dated April 25, 1994. They read thus : ""TABLE S. Chapter Description of goods Rate Conditions No. heading No. or sub-heading No. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) 1. 84.13 Power driven pumps primarily Nil designed for handling water, namely : (a) Centrifugal pumps (horizontal or vertical pumps); (b) Deep tube-well turbine pumps; (c) Submersible pumps; (d) Axial flow and mixed flow vertical pumps.

No. 4 above."" (Notification No.95/94-CE, dated 25.4.1994) In our opinion, therefore, the authorities were in error in upholding the demand and in directing the appellant to pay excise duty. The learned counsel for the appellant is also right in relying upon a decision of this Court in Collector of Central Excise, Shillong v. Wood Craft Products Ltd., [1995] 3 SCC 454. In that case, this Court held that a clarificatory notification would take effect retrospectively. Such a notification merely clarifies the position and makes explicit what was implicit. Clarificatory notifications have been issued to end the dispute between the parties. In view of the consistent policy of the Government of exempting parts of power driven pumps utilized by the factory within the factory premises, it could not be said that while issuing notification No.46/94 of March 1, 1994, the exemption in respect of said item which was operative was either withdrawn or revoked. The action was taken only with a view to rescinding several notifications and by issuing a composite notification. The policy remained as it was and in view of demand being made by the Department, a representation was made by the industries and on being satisfied, the Central Government issued a clarificatory notification No.95/94 on April 25, 1994. It was not a new notification granting exemption for the first time in respect of parts of power driven pumps to be used in the factory for manufacture of pumps but clarified the position and made the position explicit which was implicit. For the foregoing reasons, in our opinion, the appeals deserve to be allowed and are allowed accordingly. Deposit, if any, made by the appellant in pursuance of the order passed by the authorities below will be refunded to it. In the facts and circumstances of the case, however, there shall be no order as to costs","JUDGMENT: JUDGMENT Thakker, J.

28,Appeal (civil) 4838 of 1999,Vellikannu,R. Singaperumal & Anr.,06/05/2005,ASHOK BHAN & A.K. MATHUR,"J U D G M E N T A.K. MATHUR, J. This appeal is directed against the judgment of the learned Single Judge of Judicature at Madras whereby the learned Single Judge by his order dated 6th March, 1997 has allowed the Second Appeal No. 773 of 1983 filed by the respondent-1st Defendant herein. Brief facts which are necessary for disposal of this appeal are; That an Original Suit NO. 87/1978 was filed in the Court of the District Munsif, Melur by the plaintiff-appellant (herein). The schedule properties are the self-acquired properties of late Ramasami Konar and the first defendant was the only son of Ramasami Konar and the plaintiff is the wife of the first defendant. Wife of Ramasami Konar was already divorced and married with some other person and was residing separately. It is alleged that the first defendant in the suit married the plaintiff appellant and both were residing as husband and wife. On 10th October, 1972 the first defendant murdered his father, Ramasami Konar and was convicted under Section 302 IPC for life imprisonment. The conviction of the first defendant was confirmed by the High Court but the High Court recommended the Government to reduce the sentence to the period already undergone. The first defendant was released in July, 1975. Since the first defendant murdered his father, he was not entitled to succeed to the estate of his deceased father and as such the claim of the plaintiff was that she alone was entitled to all the properties left by the deceased Ramasami Konar. According to the plaintiff, the first defendant must be deemed to have predeceased as provided under Section 25 read with Section 27 of the Hindu Succession Act. She claimed to be the widow of the first defendant and claimed to be the owner of all the properties left by Ramasami Konar as coparcener. After the release of the first defendant from the prison, first defendant lived with the plaintiff for some time but after some time she was driven out of the house. Second defendant is already impleaded in the suit as tenant claiming under first defendant. Plaintiff, therefore, prayed that she may be granted the relief of declaration as she is entitled to inherit the entire estate of the deceased Ramasami Konar. As against this it was contended by the first defendant that the suit was not maintainable as the plaintiff is not the legal heir of Ramasami Konar. It was alleged that all the properties acquired by the Ramasami, were joint family properties and the   of 10 first defendant has acquired the same by survivorship. The Trial Court by Order dated 31st March, 1980 held that all the properties are joint family properties of the deceased Ramasami Konar and first defendant. The second defendant is a cultivating tenant. The first defendant having murdered his father is not entitled to claim any right under Section 6 read with Sections 25 & 27 of the Act but as per proviso to Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act plaintiff is entitled to a decree for half share and accordingly it was granted to the plaintiff. This matter was taken up in appeal by defendant No. 1. The Lower Appellate Court also confirmed the finding of the Trial Court but modified the decree that it may be treated as preliminary decree. The Lower Court also held that first defendant must be treated as non existent. The plaintiff became a Class I heir under Schedule 1 of the Hindu Succession Act and she was entitled to a share in the property. The appeal was dismissed. Aggrieved against this, the first defendant preferred a second appeal before the High Court. The High Court at the time of admission of the Second Appeal, framed following substantial questions of law. ""1. Whether Ex.A.2 judgment in the Criminal case is conclusive on the question of exclusion from inheritance in the present proceedings? and 2. Whether the exclusion from inheritance would cover enlargement of interest by survivorship, in the light of Section 6 of Hindu Succession Act ?"" So far as the question No. 1 is concerned, the High Court held that the judgment of the Criminal Court can be taken into consideration. But the main question which was addressed by the High Court was whether the plaintiff can inherit the properties from the estate of her deceased father-in-law, Ramasami Konar and what is the effect of Section 25, Section 27 read with Section 6 and Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act. It was not disputed that the properties of the Ramasami Konar were joint family properties in which the defendant No. 1 was also one of the member and the parties are governed by the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law. The learned Single Judge of the High Court after hearing the parties and considering the relevant law on the subject in detail, came to the conclusion that the view taken by both the Courts below cannot be sustained. It was held by the learned Single Judge that plaintiff cannot claim as a widow of the son of Ramasamy Konar. It was observed that plaintiff cannot claim one half share in the property being coparcenary property under Proviso to Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act . It was also observed that she is entitled to half share so long as the deceased father and son had not partitioned the property. The first defendant/ respondent No 1 herein cannot be said to have inherited any share from the victim (Ramasamy Konar) and the Plaintiff can claim as a widow only if there is a succession to the estate of the victim. If there is no succession, the deeming provision that the first defendant shall be deemed to have died before the victim (his father) also will not apply and she cannot claim as a widow of his pre-deceased son. It was also held that Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act will also not apply. The principle of justice, equity and public policy will apply and the plaintiff cannot be treated as a fresh stock of descent and defendant No.1 shall be treated as a non-existent as if he never existed. Therefore, the plaintiff also cannot claim as his  Page 3 of 10 widow. It was also observed that since plaintiff claims as a widow of the defendant No. 1 and he is disqualified, same disqualification equally applies to her for she cannot claim through murderer husband. Learned single Judge allowed the appeal of the defendant No. 1/respondent No. 1 (herein) and judgment and decree of the Courts below were set aside. The suit was dismissed. Hence the present appeal. Learned counsel for the appellant tried to persuade us that appellant being the sole female survivor of the Joint Hindu Property as her husband stands disqualified, she under proviso to Section 6 of the Act, is entitled to the whole of the estate as a sole survive member of the coparcenary property read with Section 8 of the Act as a Class I heir. As against this, learned counsel for the respondent-defendant has submitted that this disqualification which was attached to the son equally applies in the case of the wife as she is claiming the estate because of her marriage with the respondent and if he is disqualified, then she is also equally disqualified to claim any property being a coparcener from the estate of her deceased father in law. In order to appreciate the rival contention, it would be relevant to reproduce provisions of the Hindu Succession Act. Sections 6, 8, 25 and 27 of the Act which read as under: ""Section 6. Devolution of interest in coparcenary property- When a male Hindu dies after the commencement of this Act, having at the time of his death an interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary property, his interest in the property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary and not in accordance with this Act: Provided that, if the deceased had left him surviving a female relative specified in Class I of the Schedule or a male relative specified in that class who claims through such female relative, the interest of the deceased in the Mitakshara coparcenary property shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, as the case may be, under this Act and not by survivorship. Explanation 1.- For the purposes of this section, the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to be the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had taken place immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he was entitled to claim partition or not.. Explanation 2.- Nothing contained in ;the proviso to this section shall be construed as enabling a person who has separated himself from the coparcenary before the death of the deceased of any of his heirs to claim on intestacy a share in the interest referred to therein."" Section 8.- General rules of succession in the case of males.- The property of a male Hindu dying intestate shall devolve according to the provisions of this Chapter : (a) firstly, upon the heirs, being the relatives specified in class I of the Schedule; (b) secondly, if there is no heir of class I, then upon the heirs, being the relatives specified in class II of the Schedule;  Page 4 of 10 (c) thirdly, if there is no heir of any of the two classes, then upon the agnates of the deceased; and (d) lastly, if there is no agnate, then upon the cognates of the deceased. Section 25.- Murderer disqualified. \026 A person who commits murder or abets the commission of murder shall be disqualified from inheriting the property of the person murdered, or any other property in furtherance of the succession to which he or she committed or abetted the commission of the murder. Section 27.- Succession when heir disqualified - If any person is disqualified from inheriting any property under this Act, it shall devolve as if such person had died before the intestate."" As per Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, if a male Hindu dies after commencement of this Act, an interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary and not in accordance with the Act. So far as the present case is concerned, the concurrent finding of the fact is that the deceased Ramasamy Konar was governed by Mitakshara Law and the property was the coparcenary property. But he died iintestate. Therefore, as per Section 6, the property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary and not by Section 6 of the Act and at the same time there is proviso to Section which qualifies the main Section that if deceased left a surviving female relative specified in class I of the Schedule or a male relative specified in that class who claims through such female, the interest of deceased in Mitakshara coparcenary property shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, as the case may be and not by survivorship. So far as the property in question is concerned, there is a finding of the Courts below that the property is a coparcenary property and if that being so, if the defendant No. 1 had not murdered his father then perhaps a thing would have taken a different shape. But what is the effect on the succession of the property of the deceased father when son has murdered him. If he had not murdered his father he would have along with his wife would have succeed in the matter. So far as the rights of coparceners in the Mitakshara Law are concerned, son acquires by birth or adoption a vested interest in all coparcenery property whether ancestral or not and whether acquired before or after his birth or adoption, as the case may be, as a member of a joint family. This is the view which has been accepted by all the Authors of the Hindu Law. The famous principles of Mulla , 15th Edition (1982) at pages 284 and 285, the learned Author has stated thus: ""The essence of a coparcenary under the Mitakshara Law is unity of ownership. The ownership of the coparcenary property is in the whole body of coparceners. According to the true notion of an undivided family governed by the Mitakshara Law, no individual members of that family, whilst it remains un-divided, can predicate, of the joint and undivided property, that he that particular member, has a definite share, one third or one-fourth. His interest is a fluctuating interest, capable or being enlarged by  Page 5 of 10 deaths in the family, and liable to be diminished by births in the family. It is only on a partition that he becomes entitled to a definite share. The most appropriate term to describe the interest of coparcener in coparcenary property is ""undivided coparcenary interest"". The nature and extent of that interest is defined in Section 235. The rights of each coparcener until a partition takes place consist in a common possession and common enjoyment of the coparcenary property. As observed by the privy council of Katama Natchiar versus The Rajah of Shivagunga, "" there is community of interest and unity of possession between all the members of the family, and upon the death of any one of them the others may well take by survivorship that in which they had during the deceased’s lifetime a common interest and a common possession."" Likewise, S.V. Gupta, author of Hindu Law, Vol. 1, Third Edition (1981) at page 162, the learned author deals with the rights of a coparcener. He says thus: ""Until partition, coparcener is entitled to: (1) join possession and enjoyment of joint family property (2) the right to take the joint family property by survivorship, and (3) the right to demand partition of the joint family property"" At page 164, the learned author deals with the right of survivorship. He says; ""while the family remains joint, its property continues to devolve upon the coparcener for the time being by survivorship and not by succession. Consequently, on the death of a coparcener the surviving coparceners take his undivided interest in the joint family property by survivorship. There is community of interest and unity of possession between all the members of the family, and upon the death of any of them, the others may well take by survivorship that in which they had during the deceased’s life time a common interest and a common possession."" The learned Author further says : A coparcener who is disqualified by reason of a disability (such as insanity) from taking a share on partition may nevertheless take the whole property by survivorship."" At page 165, the learned Author has further said thus: By survivorship a coparcener does not obtain the share of a deceased coparcener as his representative; strictly speaking it does not pass to him the effect if merely to enlarge his share in what he already owns in the aggregate. Surviving coparceners are not therefore, the legal representatives of a deceased coparcener"". In N.R. Raghavachariar’s Hindu Law \026 Principles and precedents "" 8th Edition (1987) at 30 under the heading ’Rights of Coparceners’ it is said thus: ""The following are the rights of a coparcener :- (1)  Page 6 of 10 Right by birth (2) Right by survivorship, (3) Right to partition, (4) Right to joint possession and enjoyment, (5) Right to restrain unauthorized acts (6) Right of alienation, (7) Right to accounts and (8) Right to make self-acquisition"". While dealing with ""Right by birth’ learned Author says thus: ""Every coparcener gets an interest by birth in the coparcenary property. This right by birth relates back to the date of conception. This, however, must not be held to negative the position that coparcenary property may itself come into existence after the birth of the coparcener concerned \005"" While dealing with Right of survivorship, it is said thus: ""The system of a joint family with its incident of succession by survivorship is a peculiarity of the Hindu Law. In such a family no member has any definite share and his death of somehow ceasing to be a member of the family causes no change in the joint status of the family. Where a coparcener dies without male issue his interest in the joint family property passes to the other coparceners by survivorship and not be succession to his own heir. Even where a coparcener becomes afflicted with Lunacy subsequent to his birth, he does not lose his status as a coparcener which he has acquired by his birth, and although his lunacy may under the Hindu Law disqualify him from demanding a share in a partition in his family. Yet where all the other coparceners die and he becomes the sole surviving member of the coparcenary, he takes the whole joint family property by survivorship, and becomes a fresh stock of descent to the exclusion of the daughter of the last pre-deceased coparcener, a case of leprosy of the last surviving coparcener. The beneficial interest of each coparcener is liable to fluctuation, increasing by the death of another coparcener and decreasing by the birth of a new coparcener\005"" Therefore, it is now settled that a member of coparceners acquires a right in the property by birth. His share may fluctuate from time to time but his right by way of survivorship in copracenary property in Mitakshara Law is a settled proposition. In this connection, a reference may be made in the case of State Bank of India Vs. Ghamandi Ram reported in AIR 1969 SC 1333, it was held thus: ""According to the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law all the property of a Hindu Joint Family is held in collective ownership by all the coparceners in the quasi-corporate copacity. The textual authority of the Mitakshara Lays down in express terms that the joint famil;y property is held in trust from the joint family members then living and thereafter to be both ( See Mitakshara, Chaper I, 1-27) The incidents of coparcernership under the Mitakshara Law are: first the lineal male descendants of a person upto the third generation, acquire on birth ownership in the ancestral properties of such person; Secondly that such descendants can at any time work out their rights by asking for partition; thirdly, that till partition each member has got ownership extending over the entire property co- jointly with the rest; forthly, that as a result of such co-ownership the possession  Page 7 of 10 and enjoyment of the properties is common fifthly that no alienation of the property is possible unless it before necessity, without the concurrence of the coparceners, and sixthly; that the interest of a deceased member lapses on his death to the survivors. A coparcenary under the Mitakshara School is a creature of law and cannot arise by act of parties except in so far that on adoption the adopted son becomes a co-parcener with his adoptive father as regards the ancestral properties of the letter."" The concept of coparcener as given in the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law as already mentioned above, is that of a joint family property wherein all the members of the coparceners share equally. In this connection a reference may be made to a decision of this Court in the case of State of Maharashtra vs. Narayan Rao Sham Rao Deshmukh & Ors. reported in (1985) 2 SCC 321 in which Their Lordships have held as follows: "" A Hindu coparcenary is however, a narrower body than the joint family. Only males who acquire by birth an interest in the joint or coparcenary property can be members of the coparcenary or coparceners. A male member of a joint family and his sons, grandsons and great grandsons constitute a coparcenary. A coparcener acquires right in the coparcenary property by birth but his right can be definitely ascertained only when a partition takes place. When the family is joint, the extent of the share of a coparcener cannot be definitely predicated since it is always capable of fluctuating."" Therefore, in view of various decisions of this Court it appears that Defendant No.1 and the plaintiff who was married to Defendant No.1 were members of joint Hindu family. If the defendant- appellant had not incurred the disqualification, then they would have inherited the property as per Mitakshara School of Hindu Law. But the question is that when the sole male survivor had incurred the disqualification can he still claim the property by virtue of Mitakshara School of Hindu Law ? If he cannot get the property by way of survivorship, then the question is whether his wife who succeeds through the husband can succeed to the property? Our answer to this question is in negative. In fact, prior to the amendment of the Hindu Succession Act, Sections like 25 & 27 were not there but the murderer of his own father was disqualified on the principle of justice, equity and good conscience and as a measure of public policy. This position of law was enunciated by the Privy Council way back in 1924 in the case of Kenchava Kom Sanyellappa Hosmani & Anr. vs. Girimallappa Channappa Somasagar reported in AIR 1924 PC 209 wherein Their Lordships have held as follows: "" In their Lordships’ view it was rightly held by the two Courts below that the murderer was disqualified ; and with regard to the question whether he is disqualified wholly or only as to the beneficial interest which the Subordinate Judge discussed, founding upon the  Page 8 of 10 distinction between the beneficial and legal estate which was made by the Subordinate Judge and by the High Court of Madras in the case of Vedanayaga Mudaliar v. Vedammal , their Lordships reject, as did the High Court here, any such distinction. The theory of legal and equitable estates is no part of Hindu law, and should not be introduced into discussion. The second question to be decided is whether the title can be claimed through the murderer. If this were so, the defendants as the murderer’s sisters, would take precedence of the plaintiff, his cousin. In this matter also, their Lordships are of opinion that the Courts below were right. The murderer should be treated as non existent and not as one who forms the stock for a fresh line of descent. It may be pointed out that this view was also taken in the Madras case just cited."" Their Lordships also explained the decision in the case of Gangu vs. Chandrabhagabai reported in (1908) 32 Bom. 275 and held as follows : "" It was contended that a different ruling was to be extracted from the decision of the Bombay High Court in Gangu v. Chandrabnagabai. This is not so. In that case, the wife of a murderer was held entitled to succeed to the estate of the murdered man but that was not because the wife deduced title through her husband, but because of the principle of Hindu family law that a wife becomes a member of her husband’s gotra, an actual relation of her husband’s relations in her own right, as it is called in Hindu law a gotraja-sapinda. The decision therefore has no bearing on the present case. "" Therefore, the principle which has been enunciated by their Lordships is in no uncertain terms totally disinherit the son who has murdered his father. Their Lordships have observed as follows: "" A murderer must for the purpose of the inheritance, be treated as if he were dead when the inheritance opened and as not being a fresh stock of descent; the exclusion extends to the legal as well as beneficial estate, so that neither he can himself succeed nor can the succession be claimed through him."" This Privy Council decision made reference to the decisions of the High Courts of Madras and Bombay and their Lordships have approved the ratio contained in those decisions  Page 9 of 10 that a murderer should be totally disinherited because of the felony committed by him. This decision of the Privy Council was subsequently followed in the following cases : i. AIR (29) 1942 Madras 277 (K.Stanumurthiayya & Ors. v. K.Ramappa & Ors.) ii. AIR 1953 All. 759 ( Nakchhed Singh & Ors. vs. Bijai Bahadur Singh & Anr.) iii. AIR 1956 All. 707 (Mata Badal Singh & Ors. vs. Bijay Bahadur Singh & Ors.) iv. AIR 1982 Bomb. 68 ( Minoti vs. Sushil Mohansingh Malik & Anr.). This position of law was incorporated by way of Section 25 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 as quoted above, which clearly enunciates that a person who commits murder or abates the commission of murder shall be disqualified from inheriting the property of the person murdered, or any other property in furtherance of the succession to which he or she committed or abetted the commission of the murder. In fact, the objects and reasons also makes a reference to the Privy Council judgment (supra). The objects and reasons for enacting Section 25 read as under : "" A murderer, even if not disqualified under Hindu Law from succeeding to the estate of the person whom he has murdered, is so disqualified upon principles of justice, equity and good conscience. The murdered is not to be regarded as the stock of a fresh line of descent but should be regarded as non existent when the succession opens."" Therefore, once it is held that a person who has murdered his father or a person from whom he wants to inherit, stands totally disqualified. Section 27 of the Hindu Succession Act makes it further clear that if any person is disqualified from inheriting any property under this Act, it shall be deemed as if such person had died before the intestate. That shows that a person who has murdered a person through whom he wants to inherit the property stands disqualified on that account. That means he will be deemed to have predeceased him. The effect of Section 25 read with Section 27 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 is that a murderer is totally disqualified to succeed to the estate of deceased. The framers of the Act in the objects and reasons have made a reference to the decision of the Privy Council that the murderer is not to be regarded as the stock of a fresh line of descent but should be regarded as non-existent. That means that a person who is guilty of committing the murder cannot be treated to have any relationship whatsoever with deceased’s estate. Now, adverting to the facts of the present case, the effect of Sections 25 and 27 is that the respondent No.1 cannot inherit any property of his father as he has murdered him on the principle of justice, equity and good conscience and the fresh stock of his line of descent ceased to exist in that case. Once the son is totally disinherited then his whole stock stands disinherited i.e. wife or son. The defendant-respondent No.1 son himself is totally disqualified by virtue of Sections 25 and 27 of the Hindu Succession Act and as such the wife can have no better claim in the property of the deceased, Ramasamy Konar. Therefore, as a result of our above discussion, we are of opinion that the view taken by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Madras is correct that the plaintiff is not entitled to   10 inherit the estate of the deceased, Ramasamy Konar and the learned Single Judge has rightly set aside the orders of the two courts below. Since we cannot decide this appeal without deciding the right of the respondent No.1 as the right of the appellant flows therefrom as his wife i.e. the plaintiff. Therefore, it was necessary for us to first decide whether the respondent No.1 could succeed or inherit the estate of his deceased father. When son cannot succeed then the wife who succeeds to the property through the husband cannot also lay a claim to the property of her father-in -law. The appeal is thus dismissed. No order as to costs","J U D G M E N T A.K. MATHUR, J. This appeal is directed against the judgment of the learned Single Judge of Judicature at Madras whereby the learned Single Judge by his order dated 6th March, 1997 has allowed the Second Appeal No. 773 of 1983 filed by the respondent-1st Defendant herein. Brief facts which are necessary for disposal of this appeal are; That an Original Suit NO. 87/1978 was filed in the Court of the District Munsif, Melur by the plaintiff-appellant (herein). The schedule properties are the self-acquired properties of late Ramasami Konar and the first defendant was the only son of Ramasami Konar and the plaintiff is the wife of the first defendant. Wife of Ramasami Konar was already divorced and married with some other person and was residing separately. It is alleged that the first defendant in the suit married the plaintiff appellant and both were residing as husband and wife. On 10th October, 1972 the first defendant murdered his father, Ramasami Konar and was convicted under Section 302 IPC for life imprisonment. The conviction of the first defendant was confirmed by the High Court but the High Court recommended the Government to reduce the sentence to the period already undergone. The first defendant was released in July, 1975. Since the first defendant murdered his father, he was not entitled to succeed to the estate of his deceased father and as such the claim of the plaintiff was that she alone was entitled to all the properties left by the deceased Ramasami Konar. According to the plaintiff, the first defendant must be deemed to have predeceased as provided under Section 25 read with Section 27 of the Hindu Succession Act. She claimed to be the widow of the first defendant and claimed to be the owner of all the properties left by Ramasami Konar as coparcener. After the release of the first defendant from the prison, first defendant lived with the plaintiff for some time but after some time she was driven out of the house. Second defendant is already impleaded in the suit as tenant claiming under first defendant. Plaintiff, therefore, prayed that she may be granted the relief of declaration as she is entitled to inherit the entire estate of the deceased Ramasami Konar. As against this it was contended by the first defendant that the suit was not maintainable as the plaintiff is not the legal heir of Ramasami Konar. It was alleged that all the properties acquired by the Ramasami, were joint family properties and the   of 10 first defendant has acquired the same by survivorship. The Trial Court by Order dated 31st March, 1980 held that all the properties are joint family properties of the deceased Ramasami Konar and first defendant. The second defendant is a cultivating tenant. The first defendant having murdered his father is not entitled to claim any right under Section 6 read with Sections 25 & 27 of the Act but as per proviso to Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act plaintiff is entitled to a decree for half share and accordingly it was granted to the plaintiff. This matter was taken up in appeal by defendant No. 1. The Lower Appellate Court also confirmed the finding of the Trial Court but modified the decree that it may be treated as preliminary decree. The Lower Court also held that first defendant must be treated as non existent. The plaintiff became a Class I heir under Schedule 1 of the Hindu Succession Act and she was entitled to a share in the property. The appeal was dismissed. Aggrieved against this, the first defendant preferred a second appeal before the High Court. The High Court at the time of admission of the Second Appeal, framed following substantial questions of law. ""1. Whether Ex.A.2 judgment in the Criminal case is conclusive on the question of exclusion from inheritance in the present proceedings? and 2. Whether the exclusion from inheritance would cover enlargement of interest by survivorship, in the light of Section 6 of Hindu Succession Act ?"" So far as the question No. 1 is concerned, the High Court held that the judgment of the Criminal Court can be taken into consideration. But the main question which was addressed by the High Court was whether the plaintiff can inherit the properties from the estate of her deceased father-in-law, Ramasami Konar and what is the effect of Section 25, Section 27 read with Section 6 and Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act. It was not disputed that the properties of the Ramasami Konar were joint family properties in which the defendant No. 1 was also one of the member and the parties are governed by the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law. The learned Single Judge of the High Court after hearing the parties and considering the relevant law on the subject in detail, came to the conclusion that the view taken by both the Courts below cannot be sustained. It was held by the learned Single Judge that plaintiff cannot claim as a widow of the son of Ramasamy Konar. It was observed that plaintiff cannot claim one half share in the property being coparcenary property under Proviso to Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act . It was also observed that she is entitled to half share so long as the deceased father and son had not partitioned the property. The first defendant/ respondent No 1 herein cannot be said to have inherited any share from the victim (Ramasamy Konar) and the Plaintiff can claim as a widow only if there is a succession to the estate of the victim. If there is no succession, the deeming provision that the first defendant shall be deemed to have died before the victim (his father) also will not apply and she cannot claim as a widow of his pre-deceased son. It was also held that Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act will also not apply. The principle of justice, equity and public policy will apply and the plaintiff cannot be treated as a fresh stock of descent and defendant No.1 shall be treated as a non-existent as if he never existed. Therefore, the plaintiff also cannot claim as his  Page 3 of 10 widow. It was also observed that since plaintiff claims as a widow of the defendant No. 1 and he is disqualified, same disqualification equally applies to her for she cannot claim through murderer husband. Learned single Judge allowed the appeal of the defendant No. 1/respondent No. 1 (herein) and judgment and decree of the Courts below were set aside. The suit was dismissed. Hence the present appeal. Learned counsel for the appellant tried to persuade us that appellant being the sole female survivor of the Joint Hindu Property as her husband stands disqualified, she under proviso to Section 6 of the Act, is entitled to the whole of the estate as a sole survive member of the coparcenary property read with Section 8 of the Act as a Class I heir. As against this, learned counsel for the respondent-defendant has submitted that this disqualification which was attached to the son equally applies in the case of the wife as she is claiming the estate because of her marriage with the respondent and if he is disqualified, then she is also equally disqualified to claim any property being a coparcener from the estate of her deceased father in law. In order to appreciate the rival contention, it would be relevant to reproduce provisions of the Hindu Succession Act. Sections 6, 8, 25 and 27 of the Act which read as under: ""Section 6. Devolution of interest in coparcenary property- When a male Hindu dies after the commencement of this Act, having at the time of his death an interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary property, his interest in the property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary and not in accordance with this Act: Provided that, if the deceased had left him surviving a female relative specified in Class I of the Schedule or a male relative specified in that class who claims through such female relative, the interest of the deceased in the Mitakshara coparcenary property shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, as the case may be, under this Act and not by survivorship. Explanation 1.- For the purposes of this section, the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to be the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had taken place immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he was entitled to claim partition or not.. Explanation 2.- Nothing contained in ;the proviso to this section shall be construed as enabling a person who has separated himself from the coparcenary before the death of the deceased of any of his heirs to claim on intestacy a share in the interest referred to therein."" Section 8.- General rules of succession in the case of males.- The property of a male Hindu dying intestate shall devolve according to the provisions of this Chapter : (a) firstly, upon the heirs, being the relatives specified in class I of the Schedule; (b) secondly, if there is no heir of class I, then upon the heirs, being the relatives specified in class II of the Schedule;  Page 4 of 10 (c) thirdly, if there is no heir of any of the two classes, then upon the agnates of the deceased; and (d) lastly, if there is no agnate, then upon the cognates of the deceased. Section 25.- Murderer disqualified. \026 A person who commits murder or abets the commission of murder shall be disqualified from inheriting the property of the person murdered, or any other property in furtherance of the succession to which he or she committed or abetted the commission of the murder. Section 27.- Succession when heir disqualified - If any person is disqualified from inheriting any property under this Act, it shall devolve as if such person had died before the intestate."" As per Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, if a male Hindu dies after commencement of this Act, an interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary and not in accordance with the Act. So far as the present case is concerned, the concurrent finding of the fact is that the deceased Ramasamy Konar was governed by Mitakshara Law and the property was the coparcenary property. But he died iintestate. Therefore, as per Section 6, the property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary and not by Section 6 of the Act and at the same time there is proviso to Section which qualifies the main Section that if deceased left a surviving female relative specified in class I of the Schedule or a male relative specified in that class who claims through such female, the interest of deceased in Mitakshara coparcenary property shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, as the case may be and not by survivorship. So far as the property in question is concerned, there is a finding of the Courts below that the property is a coparcenary property and if that being so, if the defendant No. 1 had not murdered his father then perhaps a thing would have taken a different shape. But what is the effect on the succession of the property of the deceased father when son has murdered him. If he had not murdered his father he would have along with his wife would have succeed in the matter. So far as the rights of coparceners in the Mitakshara Law are concerned, son acquires by birth or adoption a vested interest in all coparcenery property whether ancestral or not and whether acquired before or after his birth or adoption, as the case may be, as a member of a joint family. This is the view which has been accepted by all the Authors of the Hindu Law. The famous principles of Mulla , 15th Edition (1982) at pages 284 and 285, the learned Author has stated thus: ""The essence of a coparcenary under the Mitakshara Law is unity of ownership. The ownership of the coparcenary property is in the whole body of coparceners.

Raghavachariar’s Hindu Law \026 Principles and precedents "" 8th Edition (1987) at 30 under the heading ’Rights of Coparceners’ it is said thus: ""The following are the rights of a coparcener :- (1)  Page 6 of 10 Right by birth (2) Right by survivorship, (3) Right to partition, (4) Right to joint possession and enjoyment, (5) Right to restrain unauthorized acts (6) Right of alienation, (7) Right to accounts and (8) Right to make self-acquisition"". While dealing with ""Right by birth’ learned Author says thus: ""Every coparcener gets an interest by birth in the coparcenary property. This right by birth relates back to the date of conception. This, however, must not be held to negative the position that coparcenary property may itself come into existence after the birth of the coparcener concerned \005"" While dealing with Right of survivorship, it is said thus: ""The system of a joint family with its incident of succession by survivorship is a peculiarity of the Hindu Law. In such a family no member has any definite share and his death of somehow ceasing to be a member of the family causes no change in the joint status of the family. Where a coparcener dies without male issue his interest in the joint family property passes to the other coparceners by survivorship and not be succession to his own heir. Even where a coparcener becomes afflicted with Lunacy subsequent to his birth, he does not lose his status as a coparcener which he has acquired by his birth, and although his lunacy may under the Hindu Law disqualify him from demanding a share in a partition in his family. Yet where all the other coparceners die and he becomes the sole surviving member of the coparcenary, he takes the whole joint family property by survivorship, and becomes a fresh stock of descent to the exclusion of the daughter of the last pre-deceased coparcener, a case of leprosy of the last surviving coparcener. The beneficial interest of each coparcener is liable to fluctuation, increasing by the death of another coparcener and decreasing by the birth of a new coparcener\005"" Therefore, it is now settled that a member of coparceners acquires a right in the property by birth. His share may fluctuate from time to time but his right by way of survivorship in copracenary property in Mitakshara Law is a settled proposition. In this connection, a reference may be made in the case of State Bank of India Vs. Ghamandi Ram reported in AIR 1969 SC 1333, it was held thus: ""According to the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law all the property of a Hindu Joint Family is held in collective ownership by all the coparceners in the quasi-corporate copacity. The textual authority of the Mitakshara Lays down in express terms that the joint famil;y property is held in trust from the joint family members then living and thereafter to be both ( See Mitakshara, Chaper I, 1-27) The incidents of coparcernership under the Mitakshara Law are: first the lineal male descendants of a person upto the third generation, acquire on birth ownership in the ancestral properties of such person; Secondly that such descendants can at any time work out their rights by asking for partition; thirdly, that till partition each member has got ownership extending over the entire property co- jointly with the rest; forthly, that as a result of such co-ownership the possession  Page 7 of 10 and enjoyment of the properties is common fifthly that no alienation of the property is possible unless it before necessity, without the concurrence of the coparceners, and sixthly; that the interest of a deceased member lapses on his death to the survivors. A coparcenary under the Mitakshara School is a creature of law and cannot arise by act of parties except in so far that on adoption the adopted son becomes a co-parcener with his adoptive father as regards the ancestral properties of the letter."" The concept of coparcener as given in the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law as already mentioned above, is that of a joint family property wherein all the members of the coparceners share equally. In this connection a reference may be made to a decision of this Court in the case of State of Maharashtra vs. Narayan Rao Sham Rao Deshmukh & Ors. reported in (1985) 2 SCC 321 in which Their Lordships have held as follows: "" A Hindu coparcenary is however, a narrower body than the joint family. Only males who acquire by birth an interest in the joint or coparcenary property can be members of the coparcenary or coparceners. A male member of a joint family and his sons, grandsons and great grandsons constitute a coparcenary. A coparcener acquires right in the coparcenary property by birth but his right can be definitely ascertained only when a partition takes place. When the family is joint, the extent of the share of a coparcener cannot be definitely predicated since it is always capable of fluctuating."" Therefore, in view of various decisions of this Court it appears that Defendant No.1 and the plaintiff who was married to Defendant No.1 were members of joint Hindu family. If the defendant- appellant had not incurred the disqualification, then they would have inherited the property as per Mitakshara School of Hindu Law. But the question is that when the sole male survivor had incurred the disqualification can he still claim the property by virtue of Mitakshara School of Hindu Law ? If he cannot get the property by way of survivorship, then the question is whether his wife who succeeds through the husband can succeed to the property? Our answer to this question is in negative. In fact, prior to the amendment of the Hindu Succession Act, Sections like 25 & 27 were not there but the murderer of his own father was disqualified on the principle of justice, equity and good conscience and as a measure of public policy. This position of law was enunciated by the Privy Council way back in 1924 in the case of Kenchava Kom Sanyellappa Hosmani & Anr. vs. Girimallappa Channappa Somasagar reported in AIR 1924 PC 209 wherein Their Lordships have held as follows: "" In their Lordships’ view it was rightly held by the two Courts below that the murderer was disqualified ; and with regard to the question whether he is disqualified wholly or only as to the beneficial interest which the Subordinate Judge discussed, founding upon the  Page 8 of 10 distinction between the beneficial and legal estate which was made by the Subordinate Judge and by the High Court of Madras in the case of Vedanayaga Mudaliar v. Vedammal , their Lordships reject, as did the High Court here, any such distinction. The theory of legal and equitable estates is no part of Hindu law, and should not be introduced into discussion. The second question to be decided is whether the title can be claimed through the murderer. If this were so, the defendants as the murderer’s sisters, would take precedence of the plaintiff, his cousin. In this matter also, their Lordships are of opinion that the Courts below were right. The murderer should be treated as non existent and not as one who forms the stock for a fresh line of descent. It may be pointed out that this view was also taken in the Madras case just cited."" Their Lordships also explained the decision in the case of Gangu vs. Chandrabhagabai reported in (1908) 32 Bom. 275 and held as follows : "" It was contended that a different ruling was to be extracted from the decision of the Bombay High Court in Gangu v. Chandrabnagabai. This is not so. In that case, the wife of a murderer was held entitled to succeed to the estate of the murdered man but that was not because the wife deduced title through her husband, but because of the principle of Hindu family law that a wife becomes a member of her husband’s gotra, an actual relation of her husband’s relations in her own right, as it is called in Hindu law a gotraja-sapinda. The decision therefore has no bearing on the present case. "" Therefore, the principle which has been enunciated by their Lordships is in no uncertain terms totally disinherit the son who has murdered his father. Their Lordships have observed as follows: "" A murderer must for the purpose of the inheritance, be treated as if he were dead when the inheritance opened and as not being a fresh stock of descent; the exclusion extends to the legal as well as beneficial estate, so that neither he can himself succeed nor can the succession be claimed through him."" This Privy Council decision made reference to the decisions of the High Courts of Madras and Bombay and their Lordships have approved the ratio contained in those decisions  Page 9 of 10 that a murderer should be totally disinherited because of the felony committed by him. This decision of the Privy Council was subsequently followed in the following cases : i. AIR (29) 1942 Madras 277 (K.Stanumurthiayya & Ors. v. K.Ramappa & Ors.) ii. AIR 1953 All. 759 ( Nakchhed Singh & Ors. vs. Bijai Bahadur Singh & Anr.) iii. AIR 1956 All. 707 (Mata Badal Singh & Ors. vs. Bijay Bahadur Singh & Ors.) iv. AIR 1982 Bomb. 68 ( Minoti vs. Sushil Mohansingh Malik & Anr.). This position of law was incorporated by way of Section 25 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 as quoted above, which clearly enunciates that a person who commits murder or abates the commission of murder shall be disqualified from inheriting the property of the person murdered, or any other property in furtherance of the succession to which he or she committed or abetted the commission of the murder. In fact, the objects and reasons also makes a reference to the Privy Council judgment (supra). The objects and reasons for enacting Section 25 read as under : "" A murderer, even if not disqualified under Hindu Law from succeeding to the estate of the person whom he has murdered, is so disqualified upon principles of justice, equity and good conscience. The murdered is not to be regarded as the stock of a fresh line of descent but should be regarded as non existent when the succession opens."" Therefore, once it is held that a person who has murdered his father or a person from whom he wants to inherit, stands totally disqualified. Section 27 of the Hindu Succession Act makes it further clear that if any person is disqualified from inheriting any property under this Act, it shall be deemed as if such person had died before the intestate. That shows that a person who has murdered a person through whom he wants to inherit the property stands disqualified on that account. That means he will be deemed to have predeceased him. The effect of Section 25 read with Section 27 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 is that a murderer is totally disqualified to succeed to the estate of deceased. The framers of the Act in the objects and reasons have made a reference to the decision of the Privy Council that the murderer is not to be regarded as the stock of a fresh line of descent but should be regarded as non-existent. That means that a person who is guilty of committing the murder cannot be treated to have any relationship whatsoever with deceased’s estate. Now, adverting to the facts of the present case, the effect of Sections 25 and 27 is that the respondent No.1 cannot inherit any property of his father as he has murdered him on the principle of justice, equity and good conscience and the fresh stock of his line of descent ceased to exist in that case. Once the son is totally disinherited then his whole stock stands disinherited i.e. wife or son. The defendant-respondent No.1 son himself is totally disqualified by virtue of Sections 25 and 27 of the Hindu Succession Act and as such the wife can have no better claim in the property of the deceased, Ramasamy Konar. Therefore, as a result of our above discussion, we are of opinion that the view taken by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Madras is correct that the plaintiff is not entitled to   10 inherit the estate of the deceased, Ramasamy Konar and the learned Single Judge has rightly set aside the orders of the two courts below. Since we cannot decide this appeal without deciding the right of the respondent No.1 as the right of the appellant flows therefrom as his wife i.e. the plaintiff. Therefore, it was necessary for us to first decide whether the respondent No.1 could succeed or inherit the estate of his deceased father. When son cannot succeed then the wife who succeeds to the property through the husband cannot also lay a claim to the property of her father-in -law. The appeal is thus dismissed. No order as to costs"
29,Appeal (crl.) 664 of 2007,Raju @ Raj Kumar,State of Rajasthan,03/05/2007,S. H. Kapadia & B. Sudershan Reddy,"J U D G M E N T CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 664 OF 2007 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Crl) No.4446 of 2006) KAPADIA, J. (1) Leave granted. (2) This criminal appeal by grant of special leave is directed against impugned judgment dated 13.1.06 delivered by Rajasthan High Court at Jaipur in D.B. Criminal Appeal No.660/04 confirming the conviction under Section 148 IPC imposed by Addl. District and Sessions Judge, Jaipur, in Session Case No.49/2001. (3) On 1.9.1989 at 9.20 pm Uttam Prakash (pw.4) lodged an FIR at Police Station Ashok Nagar, Jaipur, in which he claimed that he and his father Ram Kishan Khandelwal (since deceased) had left their house, situated at A-10, Sikar House Area, for his uncle’s house at C-10, Madan Kunj, Prithvi Raj Road, Jaipur, when at 9 pm while the deceased was sitting on the bed talking with PW.4’s aunt and uncle, 10 to 12 persons entered the room and surrounded the deceased. These 10 to 12 persons were armed with knives, swords and pick-axes. PW.4 was threatened and told not to shout. PW.4 in his FIR stated that in his presence the accused (appellant herein) stabbed his father, Ram Kishan Khandelwal. According to the FIR, when PW.4’s uncle raised an alarm the appellant herein along with others fled. Ram Kishan Khandelwal died. According to the FIR, there was enmity between Ram Kishan Khandelwal on one hand and Hanuman, Hanif, Chhitar and Ramesh Shanker on the other hand. On the basis of the said report investigation commenced. The case was registered for offences under Sections 147, 149 and 302 of Indian Penal Code (for short, ’IPC’). On the basis of the information given by the appellant herein, weapons of offence and blood soaked clothes were recovered. PW. 25, a Judicial Magistrate, conducted identification parade of the appellant herein and others. The police thereafter submitted their charge sheet, inter alia, against the appellant herein. 31 witnesses were examined. 74 documents were produced by the prosecution. During the course of the trial it was revealed that Ram Kishan Khandelwal and his family used to live at Sikar House Area in Jaipur. Hanuman and Chhitar were his neighbours. They were on inimical terms. There was property dispute. The bathroom of   of 8 Hanuman and Chhitar was demolished by Jaipur Development Authority. Hanuman and Chhitar were under the impression that the bathroom was demolished on the complaint of Ram Kishan Khandelwal. Hanuman and Chhitar sold their house to Hanif (one of the co accused). Prior to his death, Ram Kishan Khandelwal had lodged an FIR with Police Station Shastri Nagar, Jaipur, in which he had asked for police protection. Ram Kishan Khandelwal was also an accused in many criminal cases. These cases were pending. According to the prosecution, Hanuman, Chhitar and Hanif entered into a criminal conspiracy for the murder of Ram Kishan Khandelwal. According to the prosecution, however, the appellant herein along with Aziz, Iqbal, Mahendra Singh, Hamid and Firoz committed the actual murder. Therefore, according to the prosecution there were two groups of persons, the first set/group of persons entered a criminal conspiracy but the actual murder was done by Iqbal, Aziz, Raju Naik (appellant herein), Mahendra Singh, Hamid and Firoz. (4) In this case, we are concerned with the conviction of Raju Naik (appellant herein). He was charged for offences under Sections 302, 120B, 148, 149 and 460 IPC. (5) Two issues arise for determination in this criminal appeal. The first concerns the merits of the case and the second concerns an argument advanced on behalf of the appellant that the appellant has completed the sentence of three years on 8.3.2007 as he was convicted for offence under Section 148 IPC which has been disputed by the State on the ground that the appellant stood convicted under Section 302 IPC and sentenced to life imprisonment. (6) On the merits of the case, we find that there is no reason to disbelieve Uttam Prakash (pw.4), the son of Ram Kishan Khandelwal (deceased). The incident took place on 1.9.89 around 9 pm when the deceased was sitting on the bed. Uttam Prakash (pw.4) and his father, Ram Kishan Khandelwal, had gone for dinner at his uncle’s place at C-10, Madan Kunj, Prithvi Raj Road, Jaipur. When the deceased was sitting on the bed Uttam Prakash (pw.4) saw 10 to 12 persons entering the room and surrendering Ram Kishan Khandelwal. They were armed with knives, swords and pick-axes. Uttam Prakash (pw.4) saw the deceased being stabbed. Uttam Prakash (pw.4) has deposed that it was dinner time, that the deceased was sitting on the bed whereas he was in conversation with his aunt. Both the courts below have come to the conclusion, placing reliance on the post mortem report, that there was an injury on the chest of the deceased and that the knife and the clothes recovered vide Ex.P.32 had human blood. The cause of the death, as given in the post-mortem report, was syncope. There was one more witness Rattan Devi (pw.20) but she could not identify the appellant in the identification parade. However, both the courts below have come to the conclusion, on the basis of the evidence of pw.4 that the appellant herein (Raju @ Raju Kumar) was a member of the unlawful assembly; that he carried the knife; that he had entered the room where the deceased was sitting on the bed and that Ram Kishan Khandelwal (deceased) was stabbed to death by the appellant herein. In the  Page 3 of 8 circumstances, we do not find any infirmity to the extent of the conviction of the appellant herein under Section 148 IPC. (7) The question is : whether this Court in special leave petition could convict the appellant under Section 302 IPC without any appeal from the State. (8) Now coming to the second issue, we find that in this case seven out of ten accused were convicted by Additional District and Sessions Judge, No.1, (Fast Track) Jaipur City, Jaipur, for different offences. Appellant herein was charged under Section 148, 302, 120B and 460 IPC. However, he has been convicted under Section 148 IPC. According to the trial court the cause of death is syncope. According to Butterworth’s Medical Dictionary, ’Syncope’ is a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a fall in blood pressure. (9) We also quote hereinbelow paras ’65’ and ’66’ of the said judgment which read as follow: ""65. From the above decision I have reached the conclusion that out of all the accused, the accused No.(1) Abdul Aziz s/o Salamuddin, accused No.2 Raju @ Raj Kumar s/o Mali Ram, accused No.3, Durga Das @ Bhaya s/o Bhanwar Lal have committed punishable crime u/s 460, 148 and 302 of Indian Penal Code for which their crime is hereby proved and the accused No.4, Feroz @ Shreya s/o babu Khan has committed punishable crime under the Indian Penal Code Section 148, 302/149, 460 for which their crime is hereby proved and the accused No.5 Hanuman Sahai s/o Mahadev Prasad, accused No.6 Chhitar Mal s/o Mahadev Prasad, accused No.7 Mohd. Haneef s/o Abdul Hakim have committed punishable crime u/s 302/120B of the Indian Penal Code for which their crime is hereby proved and the accused No.8 Sayeed s/o Abdul Rasheed is acquitted from the allegations of punishable crime under Section 302 read with Section 149, 148, 120B and 460 of Indian Penal Code. 66. This case is a matter of murder, conspiracy to murder and co-operation in murder for which it would be justified to punish the accused with the minimum punishment and for rest of the crime the accused were heard, for which they are punished with rigorous imprisonment as mentioned below: SENTENCE Sl. NO. Name of the Accused Therefore, the accused mentioned below on being found guilty under Section as mentioned against each under Indian Penal Code are punished as below:  Page 4 of 8 Section Punishment Penalty Illegible (sic) 1. Abdul Aziz 460 Ten years 500/ 3months 2. Raju @ Raj Kumar 148 Three years 200/ 1 month 3. Durga Das @ Bhaya 302 Life Imprisonment 1000/ 6months 4. Feroz @ Sherya 460 Ten years 500/ 3months 148 Three years 200/ 1 month 302/149 Life Imprisonment 1000/ 6months 5. Hanuman Sahai 302/120B Life Imprisonment 1000/ 6months 6. Chhitar Mal - do - do - do - do 7. Mohd. Haneef - do  Page 5 of 8 - do - do - do The accused in this case are on bail, hence for getting the punishment they are being taken in the judicial custody. The punishment warrant of the accused may be prepared as per above and sent to the Central Jail, Jaipur. Punishment of all the crime will be simultaneous. In this case, the seized item of proof will be destroyed after expiry of six months of the appeal period. The file after recording of the decision may be admitted in the office. The accused with the proven crime may be provided with a copy of the decision without any cost."" (10) If one reads para ’65’ with para ’66’, we find that Abdul Aziz has been accused No.1 and he is convicted under Section 460 IPC. This is clear from para ’65’. It is in consonance with the chart in para ’66’. Similarly, the appellant (Raju @ Raj Kumar) was accused No.2 and he has been convicted under Section 148 IPC. This is clear from para ’65’. To this extent, para ’65’ is in consonance with para ’66’ (chart annexed thereto). Durga Das was accused No.3 and he has been convicted under Section 302 IPC both under paras ’65’ and ’66’. It appears from the reading of para ’65’ that accused No.1 was convicted under Section 460 IPC, accused No.2 was convicted under Section 148 IPC and accused No.3 was convicted under Section 302 IPC respectively. The word ""respectively"" is omitted. Be that as it may, the State did not go in appeal against the order of the trial court convicting Raju @ Raj Kumar (appellant herein) for convicting him under Section 302 IPC in addition to his conviction by the trial court under Section 148. Even the High Court, by the impugned judgment, has merely dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant herein upholding the conviction of Raju @ Raj Kumar under Section 148 IPC. It is argued before us, on behalf of the State, that we should convict the appellant herein under Section 302 IPC, particularly, when the reasoning given in the concurrent findings indicate that the appellant herein had stabbed the deceased in the chest with the knife. In our view, such a request cannot be granted. Offence under Section 148 IPC is distinct and separate from the offence under Section 302 IPC. The State should have filed an appeal seeking conviction of the appellant under Section 302 IPC apart from his conviction under Section 148 IPC. This has not been done in the present case. The offence of rioting with deadly weapon under Section 148 IPC is separate and distinct from the offence under Section 302 IPC. Moreover, according to the trial court, the cause of death is syncope. (11) In the case of Satbir v. Surat Singh and others \026 AIR 1997 SC 1160, the accused was sentenced under Section 302/148 IPC and, therefore, this Court took the view that separate sentence under Section 148 was not necessary.  Page 6 of 8 (12) In the case of Nanda Kishore Mohanty v. The State of Orissa \026 AIR 1961 Orissa 29, it has been held that once a charge under Section 148 IPC was framed the Magistrate must say whether the person charged is convicted or acquitted. In that case, though the petitioner was charged under Section 148 IPC, the judgment of the Magistrate was silent as to whether petitioner was guilty or not. The Additional Sessions Judge assumed that the petitioner stood convicted under Section 148 IPC altered the conviction to Section 147 IPC. In that case, the petitioner was also charged under Section 455/149 IPC and under Section 323/149 IPC. In that connection, it was held as under : ""(6) Another serious mistake committed by the Magistrate was his omission to mention expressly in his judgment as to whether he convicted the petitioner under Section 148, I. P. C., or not. Once a specific charge under that section was framed, the Magistrate must expressly say whether he convicts the accused of that offence or whether he acquits him of that offence. Though the petitioner was charged under Section 148, the judgment of the Magistrate is silent as to whether that charge was proved or not. The learned Sessions Judge also committed an error by overlooking this mistake on the part of the trying Magistrate and assuming that there was a conviction under that section by the Magistrate and that he would be justified in altering it to a conviction under Section 147, I. P.C. It is indeed unfortunate that in cases of this type where sentences of imprisonment have been passed the two lower courts should have committed such obvious mistake, presumably through negligence. (7) The net result therefore is that though the petitioner was charged under Section 148, I. P. C., the trying Magistrate has not passed any order, either of conviction or acquittal in respect of that charge and the Sessions Judge has convicted him under Section 147, I. P. C. The omission of the trying Magistrate to convict the petitioner under Section 148, I. P. C., must in the circumstances be held to mean that he was acquitted of that charge. It is immaterial whether this omission was due to oversight or any other reason. Once there is, thus, an acquittal of the petitioner of the charge under Section 148, I. P. C., the Sessions Judge has no jurisdiction to alter the conviction to one under Section 147, I. P. C. The State should have moved the High Court for setting aside the order of acquittal in respect of the charge under Section 148. But this they did not do. (8) The acquittal of the petitioner in respect of the offence under Section 148, I. P. C., will also affect his conviction under Section 455/149, I. P. C., and 323/149, I. P. C. The  Page 7 of 8 conviction for these two offences is based on the assumption that the petitioner was a member of the unlawful assembly but his acquittal in respect of the charge under Section 148, I. P. C., must necessarily lead to the inference that he was not a member of such an assembly. Hence, his conviction under Sections 455 and 323, I. P. C., read with Section 149, I. P. C., must be set aside. (9) There seems some force in the contention of the learned Standing Counsel for the State of Orissa, that the initial mistake was committed by the trying Magistrate through oversight, and he suggested that the case might be remanded to the trying Magistrate for recording a proper order either of conviction or of acquittal in respect of the charge against the petitioner under Section 148, I. P. C. But I am not satisfied that at this stage it will be proper to remand the case for the aforesaid purpose. The incident took place more than four years ago, i.e., on 6-10-1955, and the petitioner has been sufficiently harassed because the appeal was first heard by the Addl. Sessions Judge but the judgment was set aside by the High Court in Criminal Revision and the appeal was reheard by the Sessions Judge of Cuttack. It will not be proper at this belated stage to revive the whole proceeding and subject the petitioner to further harassment of a conviction by the trying Magistrate and also possibly of an appeal before the Sessions Judge. The mistake was partly that of the trying Magistrate and partly that of the prosecuting officers. The latter should have noticed the omission in the judgment of the trying Magistrate and then taken steps either by way of revision to this Court or by means of an appeal against acquittal, to get the mistake rectified. (10) For the aforesaid reasons, I would allow this revision petition, set aside the conviction and sentence passed on the petitioner by the learned Sessions Judge, and acquit him. He should be set at liberty forthwith."" (13) Before concluding we may state that one of the arguments advanced on behalf of the State was that no prejudice would be caused to the appellant if he was to be convicted under Section 302 IPC. It was contended on behalf of the State that if one goes through the entire judgment of the trial court it is clear from the reasoning that the trial court had found the appellant guilty of murder under Section 302 IPC and that the appellant has never made any grievance against the said finding. It  Page 8 of 8 is submitted on behalf of the State that even in the special leave petition, before this Court, this particular ground has not been taken by the appellant. We find no merit in this contention. We cannot convict the appellant under Section 302 IPC in the appeal preferred by the appellant herein. If we were to do so it would amount to travesty of justice. We cannot convict the accused under Section 302 without the State filing an appeal in that regard. In the present case, the State did not move the High Court in appeal against the conviction under Section 148 and nor did the State seek enhancement of punishment before the High Court in appeal. (14) For the above reasons, we find that the appellant herein was convicted under Section 148 IPC; that, he was not convicted under Section 302 IPC; that he was sentenced for three years with fine in addition, one month sentence in default of fine; and that Raju @ Raj Kumar (appellant herein) has served sentence for three years commencing from 9.3.2004 ending on 8.3.2007. We are not sure as to whether he has paid the fine of Rs.200/-, if not, he shall pay the fine forthwith. On payment of fine he should be set at liberty forthwith. If he fails to pay Rs.200/- as fine then he will have to serve the sentence of one month in default. (15) Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.","J U D G M E N T CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 664 OF 2007 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Crl) No.4446 of 2006) KAPADIA, J. (1) Leave granted. (2) This criminal appeal by grant of special leave is directed against impugned judgment dated 13.1.06 delivered by Rajasthan High Court at Jaipur in D.B. Criminal Appeal No.660/04 confirming the conviction under Section 148 IPC imposed by Addl. District and Sessions Judge, Jaipur, in Session Case No.49/2001. (3) On 1.9.1989 at 9.20 pm Uttam Prakash (pw.4) lodged an FIR at Police Station Ashok Nagar, Jaipur, in which he claimed that he and his father Ram Kishan Khandelwal (since deceased) had left their house, situated at A-10, Sikar House Area, for his uncle’s house at C-10, Madan Kunj, Prithvi Raj Road, Jaipur, when at 9 pm while the deceased was sitting on the bed talking with PW.4’s aunt and uncle, 10 to 12 persons entered the room and surrounded the deceased.

Hanuman and Chhitar were under the impression that the bathroom was demolished on the complaint of Ram Kishan Khandelwal. Hanuman and Chhitar sold their house to Hanif (one of the co accused). Prior to his death, Ram Kishan Khandelwal had lodged an FIR with Police Station Shastri Nagar, Jaipur, in which he had asked for police protection. Ram Kishan Khandelwal was also an accused in many criminal cases. These cases were pending. According to the prosecution, Hanuman, Chhitar and Hanif entered into a criminal conspiracy for the murder of Ram Kishan Khandelwal. According to the prosecution, however, the appellant herein along with Aziz, Iqbal, Mahendra Singh, Hamid and Firoz committed the actual murder. Therefore, according to the prosecution there were two groups of persons, the first set/group of persons entered a criminal conspiracy but the actual murder was done by Iqbal, Aziz, Raju Naik (appellant herein), Mahendra Singh, Hamid and Firoz. (4) In this case, we are concerned with the conviction of Raju Naik (appellant herein). He was charged for offences under Sections 302, 120B, 148, 149 and 460 IPC. (5) Two issues arise for determination in this criminal appeal. The first concerns the merits of the case and the second concerns an argument advanced on behalf of the appellant that the appellant has completed the sentence of three years on 8.3.2007 as he was convicted for offence under Section 148 IPC which has been disputed by the State on the ground that the appellant stood convicted under Section 302 IPC and sentenced to life imprisonment. (6) On the merits of the case, we find that there is no reason to disbelieve Uttam Prakash (pw.4), the son of Ram Kishan Khandelwal (deceased). The incident took place on 1.9.89 around 9 pm when the deceased was sitting on the bed. Uttam Prakash (pw.4) and his father, Ram Kishan Khandelwal, had gone for dinner at his uncle’s place at C-10, Madan Kunj, Prithvi Raj Road, Jaipur. When the deceased was sitting on the bed Uttam Prakash (pw.4) saw 10 to 12 persons entering the room and surrendering Ram Kishan Khandelwal. They were armed with knives, swords and pick-axes. Uttam Prakash (pw.4) saw the deceased being stabbed. Uttam Prakash (pw.4) has deposed that it was dinner time, that the deceased was sitting on the bed whereas he was in conversation with his aunt. Both the courts below have come to the conclusion, placing reliance on the post mortem report, that there was an injury on the chest of the deceased and that the knife and the clothes recovered vide Ex.P.32 had human blood. The cause of the death, as given in the post-mortem report, was syncope. There was one more witness Rattan Devi (pw.20) but she could not identify the appellant in the identification parade. However, both the courts below have come to the conclusion, on the basis of the evidence of pw.4 that the appellant herein (Raju @ Raju Kumar) was a member of the unlawful assembly; that he carried the knife; that he had entered the room where the deceased was sitting on the bed and that Ram Kishan Khandelwal (deceased) was stabbed to death by the appellant herein. In the  Page 3 of 8 circumstances, we do not find any infirmity to the extent of the conviction of the appellant herein under Section 148 IPC. (7) The question is : whether this Court in special leave petition could convict the appellant under Section 302 IPC without any appeal from the State. (8) Now coming to the second issue, we find that in this case seven out of ten accused were convicted by Additional District and Sessions Judge, No.1, (Fast Track) Jaipur City, Jaipur, for different offences. Appellant herein was charged under Section 148, 302, 120B and 460 IPC. However, he has been convicted under Section 148 IPC. According to the trial court the cause of death is syncope. According to Butterworth’s Medical Dictionary, ’Syncope’ is a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a fall in blood pressure. (9) We also quote hereinbelow paras ’65’ and ’66’ of the said judgment which read as follow: ""65. From the above decision I have reached the conclusion that out of all the accused, the accused No.(1) Abdul Aziz s/o Salamuddin, accused No.2 Raju @ Raj Kumar s/o Mali Ram, accused No.3, Durga Das @ Bhaya s/o Bhanwar Lal have committed punishable crime u/s 460, 148 and 302 of Indian Penal Code for which their crime is hereby proved and the accused No.4, Feroz @ Shreya s/o babu Khan has committed punishable crime under the Indian Penal Code Section 148, 302/149, 460 for which their crime is hereby proved and the accused No.5 Hanuman Sahai s/o Mahadev Prasad, accused No.6 Chhitar Mal s/o Mahadev Prasad, accused No.7 Mohd. Haneef s/o Abdul Hakim have committed punishable crime u/s 302/120B of the Indian Penal Code for which their crime is hereby proved and the accused No.8 Sayeed s/o Abdul Rasheed is acquitted from the allegations of punishable crime under Section 302 read with Section 149, 148, 120B and 460 of Indian Penal Code. 66. This case is a matter of murder, conspiracy to murder and co-operation in murder for which it would be justified to punish the accused with the minimum punishment and for rest of the crime the accused were heard, for which they are punished with rigorous imprisonment as mentioned below: SENTENCE Sl. NO. Name of the Accused Therefore, the accused mentioned below on being found guilty under Section as mentioned against each under Indian Penal Code are punished as below:  Page 4 of 8 Section Punishment Penalty Illegible (sic) 1. Abdul Aziz 460 Ten years 500/ 3months 2. Raju @ Raj Kumar 148 Three years 200/ 1 month 3. Durga Das @ Bhaya 302 Life Imprisonment 1000/ 6months 4.

Chhitar Mal - do - do - do - do 7. Mohd. Haneef - do  Page 5 of 8 - do - do - do The accused in this case are on bail, hence for getting the punishment they are being taken in the judicial custody. The punishment warrant of the accused may be prepared as per above and sent to the Central Jail, Jaipur. Punishment of all the crime will be simultaneous. In this case, the seized item of proof will be destroyed after expiry of six months of the appeal period. The file after recording of the decision may be admitted in the office. The accused with the proven crime may be provided with a copy of the decision without any cost."" (10) If one reads para ’65’ with para ’66’, we find that Abdul Aziz has been accused No.1 and he is convicted under Section 460 IPC. This is clear from para ’65’. It is in consonance with the chart in para ’66’. Similarly, the appellant (Raju @ Raj Kumar) was accused No.2 and he has been convicted under Section 148 IPC. This is clear from para ’65’. To this extent, para ’65’ is in consonance with para ’66’ (chart annexed thereto). Durga Das was accused No.3 and he has been convicted under Section 302 IPC both under paras ’65’ and ’66’. It appears from the reading of para ’65’ that accused No.1 was convicted under Section 460 IPC, accused No.2 was convicted under Section 148 IPC and accused No.3 was convicted under Section 302 IPC respectively. The word ""respectively"" is omitted. Be that as it may, the State did not go in appeal against the order of the trial court convicting Raju @ Raj Kumar (appellant herein) for convicting him under Section 302 IPC in addition to his conviction by the trial court under Section 148. Even the High Court, by the impugned judgment, has merely dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant herein upholding the conviction of Raju @ Raj Kumar under Section 148 IPC. It is argued before us, on behalf of the State, that we should convict the appellant herein under Section 302 IPC, particularly, when the reasoning given in the concurrent findings indicate that the appellant herein had stabbed the deceased in the chest with the knife. In our view, such a request cannot be granted. Offence under Section 148 IPC is distinct and separate from the offence under Section 302 IPC. The State should have filed an appeal seeking conviction of the appellant under Section 302 IPC apart from his conviction under Section 148 IPC. This has not been done in the present case. The offence of rioting with deadly weapon under Section 148 IPC is separate and distinct from the offence under Section 302 IPC. Moreover, according to the trial court, the cause of death is syncope. (11) In the case of Satbir v. Surat Singh and others \026 AIR 1997 SC 1160, the accused was sentenced under Section 302/148 IPC and, therefore, this Court took the view that separate sentence under Section 148 was not necessary.  Page 6 of 8 (12) In the case of Nanda Kishore Mohanty v. The State of Orissa \026 AIR 1961 Orissa 29, it has been held that once a charge under Section 148 IPC was framed the Magistrate must say whether the person charged is convicted or acquitted. In that case, though the petitioner was charged under Section 148 IPC, the judgment of the Magistrate was silent as to whether petitioner was guilty or not. The Additional Sessions Judge assumed that the petitioner stood convicted under Section 148 IPC altered the conviction to Section 147 IPC. In that case, the petitioner was also charged under Section 455/149 IPC and under Section 323/149 IPC. In that connection, it was held as under : ""(6) Another serious mistake committed by the Magistrate was his omission to mention expressly in his judgment as to whether he convicted the petitioner under Section 148, I. P. C., or not. Once a specific charge under that section was framed, the Magistrate must expressly say whether he convicts the accused of that offence or whether he acquits him of that offence. Though the petitioner was charged under Section 148, the judgment of the Magistrate is silent as to whether that charge was proved or not. The learned Sessions Judge also committed an error by overlooking this mistake on the part of the trying Magistrate and assuming that there was a conviction under that section by the Magistrate and that he would be justified in altering it to a conviction under Section 147, I. P.C. It is indeed unfortunate that in cases of this type where sentences of imprisonment have been passed the two lower courts should have committed such obvious mistake, presumably through negligence. (7) The net result therefore is that though the petitioner was charged under Section 148, I. P. C., the trying Magistrate has not passed any order, either of conviction or acquittal in respect of that charge and the Sessions Judge has convicted him under Section 147, I. P. C. The omission of the trying Magistrate to convict the petitioner under Section 148, I. P. C., must in the circumstances be held to mean that he was acquitted of that charge. It is immaterial whether this omission was due to oversight or any other reason. Once there is, thus, an acquittal of the petitioner of the charge under Section 148, I. P. C., the Sessions Judge has no jurisdiction to alter the conviction to one under Section 147, I. P. C. The State should have moved the High Court for setting aside the order of acquittal in respect of the charge under Section 148. But this they did not do. (8) The acquittal of the petitioner in respect of the offence under Section 148, I. P. C., will also affect his conviction under Section 455/149, I. P. C., and 323/149, I. P. C. The  Page 7 of 8 conviction for these two offences is based on the assumption that the petitioner was a member of the unlawful assembly but his acquittal in respect of the charge under Section 148, I. P. C., must necessarily lead to the inference that he was not a member of such an assembly. Hence, his conviction under Sections 455 and 323, I. P. C., read with Section 149, I. P. C., must be set aside. (9) There seems some force in the contention of the learned Standing Counsel for the State of Orissa, that the initial mistake was committed by the trying Magistrate through oversight, and he suggested that the case might be remanded to the trying Magistrate for recording a proper order either of conviction or of acquittal in respect of the charge against the petitioner under Section 148, I. P. C. But I am not satisfied that at this stage it will be proper to remand the case for the aforesaid purpose. The incident took place more than four years ago, i.e., on 6-10-1955, and the petitioner has been sufficiently harassed because the appeal was first heard by the Addl. Sessions Judge but the judgment was set aside by the High Court in Criminal Revision and the appeal was reheard by the Sessions Judge of Cuttack. It will not be proper at this belated stage to revive the whole proceeding and subject the petitioner to further harassment of a conviction by the trying Magistrate and also possibly of an appeal before the Sessions Judge. The mistake was partly that of the trying Magistrate and partly that of the prosecuting officers. The latter should have noticed the omission in the judgment of the trying Magistrate and then taken steps either by way of revision to this Court or by means of an appeal against acquittal, to get the mistake rectified. (10) For the aforesaid reasons, I would allow this revision petition, set aside the conviction and sentence passed on the petitioner by the learned Sessions Judge, and acquit him. He should be set at liberty forthwith."" (13) Before concluding we may state that one of the arguments advanced on behalf of the State was that no prejudice would be caused to the appellant if he was to be convicted under Section 302 IPC. It was contended on behalf of the State that if one goes through the entire judgment of the trial court it is clear from the reasoning that the trial court had found the appellant guilty of murder under Section 302 IPC and that the appellant has never made any grievance against the said finding. It  Page 8 of 8 is submitted on behalf of the State that even in the special leave petition, before this Court, this particular ground has not been taken by the appellant. We find no merit in this contention. We cannot convict the appellant under Section 302 IPC in the appeal preferred by the appellant herein. If we were to do so it would amount to travesty of justice. We cannot convict the accused under Section 302 without the State filing an appeal in that regard. In the present case, the State did not move the High Court in appeal against the conviction under Section 148 and nor did the State seek enhancement of punishment before the High Court in appeal. (14) For the above reasons, we find that the appellant herein was convicted under Section 148 IPC; that, he was not convicted under Section 302 IPC; that he was sentenced for three years with fine in addition, one month sentence in default of fine; and that Raju @ Raj Kumar (appellant herein) has served sentence for three years commencing from 9.3.2004 ending on 8.3.2007. We are not sure as to whether he has paid the fine of Rs.200/-, if not, he shall pay the fine forthwith. On payment of fine he should be set at liberty forthwith. If he fails to pay Rs.200/- as fine then he will have to serve the sentence of one month in default. (15) Accordingly, the appeal is allowed."
30,Appeal (civil) 13382-83 of 1996,BHAVSINGH (DEAD) BY LRS.,KESHAR SINGH AND ORS.,10/09/2003,M.B. SHAH & DR. AR. LAKSHMANAN,"JUDGMENT 2003 Supp(3) SCR 607 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHAH, J. : These appeals are filed against the judgment and order dated 11.9.1993 and order dated 21.3.1994 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur Bench at Indore, in M.P. No. 274 of 1987 and in review petition bearing MCC No. 550 of 1993. By the impugned judgment and orders, the High Court allowed the writ petition filed by respondent No. 1 (deceased) and his son, respondent no. 2, namely, Narendra Kumar and set aside the order dated 11.2.1986 passed by the competent authority - SDO holding that the appellant was entitled for a declaration that the sale transaction in question was prohibited transaction of loan as contemplated under Section 2(0 of the Madhya Pradesh Samaj Ke Kamjor Vargon Ke Krishi Bhumi Dharakon Ka Udhar Dene Walon Ke Bhumi Hadapane Sambandhi Kuchakron Se Paritran Tatha Mukti Adhiniyam, 1976 (M.P. Act No. 3 of 1977) (hereinafter referred to so ’the Act of 1977’) and was null and void under Section 7(2) of the Act. The order for handing over possession of the land in question admeasuring 9.71 acres situated in village Kanadia to the appellant Bhav Singh son of Bheraji was also set aside. The aforesaid order was passed on an application filed by the appellant claiming relief under Section 5 of the Act of 1977 contending that the transfer of the land by registered sale deed dated 20.7.1960 for a sum of Rs. 2500 was a mortgage transaction as said transfer was for the loan amount. R was his contention that at the time of said transaction, it was agreed upon by the parties that whenever the appellant re-pays the amount of Rs. 2500 possession of the land in question would be redelivered to the appellant. It was his case that despite the fact that full amount had been repaid, the respondent has not restored the possession of the land mortgaged by him. That application was allowed by the S.D.O. by order dated 29th January 1982. Being aggrieved by the said order, respondents preferred appeal before the Collector, Indore, which was dismissed on 8th December, 1982. That order was challenged by filing Misc. Petition No. 724 of 1982 before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore. The High Court allowed the said petition and set aside the order of the SDO and remanded the matter directing that the case be disposed of on merits after holding fresh enquiry. During the fresh enquiry, as stated in the order, witnesses were examined on behalf of the parties and written arguments were also submitted before the SDO. After considering the written submissions made by the parties and appreciating the evidence which was led before him, the SDO rejected the contention that the present proceedings were barred by the principles of res-judicata on the ground that in the previous proceedings initiated by the appellant under the provisions of the M.P. Anusuchit Jan Jati Rini Sahayata Adhiniyam, 1967 (hereinafter referred to as ’Debit Relief Act’),   of 6 it was held that the transfer deed was not a mortgage and was not covered by the Debt Relief Act. The contention that application was time barred was rejected taking into consideration relevant facts. No contention was raised that proper opportunity of leading evidence or cross-examining the witnesses was not given. SDO further held that there was a money lending transaction between the appellant and deceased respondent and that the aforesaid instrument was executed as a sale-deed but deceased - respondent No. 1 had assured the appellant that after the amount of loan is repaid, the land in question would be restored to him. He considered the evidence on record indicating that the appellant was to repay a sum of Rs. 2000 on account of the debt incurred by him from the respondent but because there was emergent need, he further took a loan of Rs. 500. Thus, the appellant owed a total sum of Rs. 2500, upon which the respondent was charging interest @ 1.5% per month. He also arrived at the conclusion that the market value of the land at the relevant time was much higher than Rs. 7000. Thereafter, the S.D.O. passed the impugned order holding that the transaction was null and void under Section 7(2) of the Act of 1977. That order was confirmed in appeal by the Additional Collector, Indore (MP) by judgment and order dated 27th February, 1987. He also negatived the contention that the proceedings were barred by the principles of res judicata as both the Acts are different. He also negatived the contention that S.D.O. has not made proper enquiry and, therefore, the entire proceedings were unconstitutional. That judgment and order was challenged by filing the writ petition before the High Court. The High Court arrived at the conclusion that previous application filed by the appellant under the Debt Relief Act was decided against the appellant and it was held that the transaction was of sale and not of a mortgage. In such a situation, the principles of res-judicata would be attracted otherwise there would be no finality in the matter and the purchaser of the land would be subject to harassment all the time. Learned counsel Mr. Jain appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the aforesaid findings recorded by the High Court are, on the face of it, illegal and erroneous. He pointed out that the amplitude of the ’prohibited transaction’ under the Act is much wider than what is provided under the Debt Relief Act. As against this, learned senior counsel Mr. Gambhir submitted that the High Court rightly arrived at the conclusion that the present proceedings are barred by the principles of res-judicata in view of the previous decision whereby the application filed by the appellant was rejected and it was held that the transaction between the parties was not a mortgage but outright sale. For appreciating the contention raised by the parties, we would first refer to Preamble as well as Section 2(f) of the Act 1977, which are as under : ""An Act to better economic condition of holders of agricultural land in the weaker sections of the people by providing further relief from agricultural indebtedness by nullifying the land grabbing designs resorted to in many a form by lenders of money while and after extending credit to them and matters connected therewith. Whereas a holder of agricultural land in the weaker sections of the people is quite often compelled to seek loan from private money lending agencies to meet his various obligations of urgent nature; And whereas such private agencies seldom if ever advance loan to him without security of land, his only wherewithal; And whereas due to ignorance of niceties of law or urgency of financial need or both, he falls an easy prey to them scarcely realizing the legal consequences arising out of the documents which he executes or which they get executed from him seemingly by way of security for the loan; And whereas it is necessary to relieve the holders of agricultural land in  Page 3 of 6 the weaker sections of the people from such exploitation by nullifying such past transactions of loan as also to put a stop to such transactions"". 2. Definitions. - In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, (f) ""prohibited transaction of loan"" means a transaction in which a lender of money advances loan to a holder of agricultural land against security of his interest in land, whether at the time of advancing the loan or at any time thereafter during the currency of the loan in any of the following modes, namely : (i) agreement to sell land with or without delivery of possession; (ii) outright sale of land with or without delevery of possession accompanied by separate agreement to re-sell it; (iii) outright sale of land with or without delivery of possession with a distinct oral understanding that the sale shall not be acted upon if the loan is re-paid; (iv) outright sale of land with or without delivery of possesion with a condition incorporated in the sale deed to re-sell it on re-payment of the loan; (v) transaction in any modes other than those specified in clauses (i) to (iv) affecting interest in land including a fraudulent transaction or a transaction designed to defeat the provisions of any law regulating money lending or interest, for the time being in force, and includes all those transactions in which a lender of money has, after the appointed day but on or before the date of publication of this Act in the Gazette, obtained possession of land of the holder of agricultural land through court or by force or otherwise or obtained a decree for such possession towards satisfaction of loan."" (i) the amount of principal money, From the aforequoted preamble of the Act, it is amply clear that the object of the Act is to provide further relief to the weaker sections of the people agriculturists from agricultural indebtedness by nullifying the land grabbing designs resorted to by the money lenders while and after extending credit to them. Section 2(f) defines the phrase ""prohibited transaction of loan"" and inter alia declares that a transaction of outright sale of land would also be covered by the phrase ""prohibited transaction of loan"" if there was a distinct oral understanding that the sale shall not be acted upon if the loan is repaid. Further, Section 6 provides for enquiry to be carried out by Sub-Divisional Officer on an application which may be filed by an holder of agricultural land who belongs to weaker section of the people. Sub-section (4) of Section 6 provides that, in that enquiry, for the purpose of ascertaining the true nature of transaction of loan, SDO shall collect, as far as may be, information with respect to the following facts, namely : (ii) the market value of the land at the time of transaction; (iii) adequacy of the amount of principal money as consideration for sale in the context of then market value under clause (ii); (iv) whether the consideration shown in the document was paid in whole or in part privately or before the Sub-Registrar. (v) whether possession of the land was actually delivered to the lender of money as per recitals in the said document. If not, when and in what manner the lender of money obtained possession of the land; (vi) what were the terms of the actual agreement between the lender of  Page 4 of 6 money and the holder of agricultural land including the rate of interest; (vii) the extent of urgency for the loan and the availability of other sources to the holder of agricultural land to obtain the same; (viii) payment, if any, made by the holder of agricultural land to the lender of money towards the loan; (ix) whether the lender of money is registered money lender or not; (x) any other surrounding circumstances which the Sub-Divisional Officer may deem fit to consider. Thereafter, Section 7 inter alia provides that if after enquiry, the SDO is satisfied that the transaction of loan in substance is a prohibited transaction of loan, he shall declare such transaction to be void and pass an order setting aside the transfer of land to the lender of money consequently restoring the possession of land to the holder of the agricultural land. After following the aforesaid procedure, the authorities below arrived at the conclusion that during currency of loan transaction, sale deed was executed by the appellant in favour of respondent No. 2. The SDO also arrived at the conclusion that there was a distinct oral understanding that the sale shall not be acted upon if the loan is repaid. For this purpose, SDO took into consideration that the appellant was indebted for a sum of Rs. 2000/- and thereafter he took further loan of Rs. 500 and for the said amount sale deed was executed. It is stated in the sale-deed that appellant was agriculturist and the sale consideration was Rs. 2500 but it is not mentioned that amount of Rs. 2500 was paid in cash. He arrived at the conclusion that market value of the land at the relevant time was more than Rs. 7000/-. Admittedly, the appellant belongs to Bagri community which is a Schedule Tribe. He was entitled to get the benefit under the Act, if the transfer was for the loan amount with distinct oral understandings as stated above. Therefore, it cannot be said that the order passed by the SDO which was confirmed in apeal by the Additional Collector was, in any way, erroneous on facts. The next question would be - whether the present proceedings are barred by principles of res-judicata presuming that principles of res-judicata are applicable to such proceedings. For appreciating this contention, it would be necessary to refer to the relevant provisions of the Debt Relief Act, under which previous application was filed for relieving the appellant from the debt incurred by him. Under the said Act, definition of the debt is given under Section 2(4), which reads as under : ""2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires : (4) ""Debt"" includes; (i) all liabilities owing to a creditor in cash, or kind, secured or unsecured, payable under a decree or order of a Civil Court or otherwise, and subsisting on the appointed date whether due or not due; (ii) arrears of wages or salary subsisting on the appointed date."" Section 8 of Debt Relief Act provides for filing of an application by the creditor and also the debtor. If the creditor has not filed his claim application against the debtor, sub-section (4) of Section 8 provides that debtor is discharged from his liability. Sub-section (3) empowers the debtor also to apply to the Debt Relief Court. Section 14 provides that the Court shall calculate the interest in accordance with the rate specified in  Page 5 of 6 the First Schedule or such lower rate of interest as may have been agreed between the parties. Section 14(4) also empowers the Debt Relief Court of reduce the principal amount determined under sub-section (1) in accordance with Second Schedule appended to the Act. Thereafter, the Act further provides for preparation of a scheme of repayment of the debt. Hence, it is apparent that the provisions of the Debt Relief Act and the Act of 1977 operate in different fields. Debt Relief Act provides for relief to the debtor, who belongs to Schedule Tribe by scaling down the principal amount and the rate of interest as provided under the Schedule. As against this, the Act of 1977 is of wider amplitude and even if there is outright sale transaction by a debtor, it would be considered to be prohibited transaction of ’loan’ and that can be declared null and void under the provisions of the Act. The Legislature has specifically stated in the preamble that the Act was for providing further relief to the holders of agricultural land from agricultural indebtedness by nullifying the land grabbing designs resorted to by money lenders. Therefore, it provides not only for nullifying of mortgage deeds but also outright sale of land if conditions mentioned therein are satisfied. Further, the relief which is required to be granted under the provisions of the Act of 1977 is altogether different from the relief which is granted under the Debt Relief Act. One provides for declaring the sale transaction to be null and void while other provides only for scaling down the amount of the debt and the interest. Therefore, even in the previous proceedings if it is held that the transaction was not a mortgage but a sale, that would not mean that in the present proceedings, the appellant can not prove that the sale deed was executed for the loan amount with a specific understanding that on refund of the amount, property was to be redelivered to the transferor. In this view of the matter, even though in a previous proceeding there was a specific finding that the deed was not a mortgage deed (which is a fact), the present proceeding would not be barred by the principles of res-judicata. The cause of action and reliefs in the first and second proceedings are altogether different. This is also provided under Section 3 of the Act of 1977 by giving over-riding effect to the provisions of the Act. It inter alia provides that the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force. The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that enquiry held by the SDO was defective. In our view, no such contention was raised before the Additional Collector who heard the appeal. In any set of circumstances, from the written submissions which are reproduced in the judgment and order passed by the SDO, no such contention is appeared to have been taken. Hence, this contention is without any substance. Learned counsel for the respondents lastly submitted that these appeals abate as the appellant has not brought on record all the heirs of the deceased respondent no. 1 as party-respondents. In the present case, it is admitted fact that the sale-deed were executed in favour of respondent No. 2. who is the son of deceased respondent No 1. The sale transaction was between the appellant and respondent No. 2. No doubt, it was for a loan given by respondent No. 1 but the question involved in this proceeding is for declaration of sale deed executed in favour of respondent No. 2 to be null and void and that can be granted even without bringing on record the other heirs of respondent No. 1. In the alternative, from the facts of the present case, it has been rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant that the estate is fully represented by respondent No. 2. Hence, there is no question of abatement of appeal. In this view of the matter, we have thought it fit not to issue notice to remaining legal heirs of respondent No. 1 on an application filed by the appellant. In the result, the appeals are allowed. The impugned judgments and orders passed by the High Court are set aside and quashed. The judgment and order  Page 6 of 6 passed by the SDO is restored. There shall be no order as to costs.","JUDGMENT 2003 Supp(3) SCR 607 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHAH, J. : These appeals are filed against the judgment and order dated 11.9.1993 and order dated 21.3.1994 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur Bench at Indore, in M.P. No. 274 of 1987 and in review petition bearing MCC No. 550 of 1993. By the impugned judgment and orders, the High Court allowed the writ petition filed by respondent No. 1 (deceased) and his son, respondent no. 2, namely, Narendra Kumar and set aside the order dated 11.2.1986 passed by the competent authority - SDO holding that the appellant was entitled for a declaration that the sale transaction in question was prohibited transaction of loan as contemplated under Section 2(0 of the Madhya Pradesh Samaj Ke Kamjor Vargon Ke Krishi Bhumi Dharakon Ka Udhar Dene Walon Ke Bhumi Hadapane Sambandhi Kuchakron Se Paritran Tatha Mukti Adhiniyam, 1976 (M.P. Act No. 3 of 1977) (hereinafter referred to so ’the Act of 1977’) and was null and void under Section 7(2) of the Act. The order for handing over possession of the land in question admeasuring 9.71 acres situated in village Kanadia to the appellant Bhav Singh son of Bheraji was also set aside. The aforesaid order was passed on an application filed by the appellant claiming relief under Section 5 of the Act of 1977 contending that the transfer of the land by registered sale deed dated 20.7.1960 for a sum of Rs. 2500 was a mortgage transaction as said transfer was for the loan amount. R was his contention that at the time of said transaction, it was agreed upon by the parties that whenever the appellant re-pays the amount of Rs. 2500 possession of the land in question would be redelivered to the appellant. It was his case that despite the fact that full amount had been repaid, the respondent has not restored the possession of the land mortgaged by him. That application was allowed by the S.D.O. by order dated 29th January 1982. Being aggrieved by the said order, respondents preferred appeal before the Collector, Indore, which was dismissed on 8th December, 1982. That order was challenged by filing Misc. Petition No. 724 of 1982 before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore. The High Court allowed the said petition and set aside the order of the SDO and remanded the matter directing that the case be disposed of on merits after holding fresh enquiry. During the fresh enquiry, as stated in the order, witnesses were examined on behalf of the parties and written arguments were also submitted before the SDO. After considering the written submissions made by the parties and appreciating the evidence which was led before him, the SDO rejected the contention that the present proceedings were barred by the principles of res-judicata on the ground that in the previous proceedings initiated by the appellant under the provisions of the M.P. Anusuchit Jan Jati Rini Sahayata Adhiniyam, 1967 (hereinafter referred to as ’Debit Relief Act’),   of 6 it was held that the transfer deed was not a mortgage and was not covered by the Debt Relief Act. The contention that application was time barred was rejected taking into consideration relevant facts. No contention was raised that proper opportunity of leading evidence or cross-examining the witnesses was not given. SDO further held that there was a money lending transaction between the appellant and deceased respondent and that the aforesaid instrument was executed as a sale-deed but deceased - respondent No. 1 had assured the appellant that after the amount of loan is repaid, the land in question would be restored to him. He considered the evidence on record indicating that the appellant was to repay a sum of Rs. 2000 on account of the debt incurred by him from the respondent but because there was emergent need, he further took a loan of Rs. 500. Thus, the appellant owed a total sum of Rs. 2500, upon which the respondent was charging interest @ 1.5% per month. He also arrived at the conclusion that the market value of the land at the relevant time was much higher than Rs. 7000. Thereafter, the S.D.O. passed the impugned order holding that the transaction was null and void under Section 7(2) of the Act of 1977. That order was confirmed in appeal by the Additional Collector, Indore (MP) by judgment and order dated 27th February, 1987. He also negatived the contention that the proceedings were barred by the principles of res judicata as both the Acts are different. He also negatived the contention that S.D.O. has not made proper enquiry and, therefore, the entire proceedings were unconstitutional. That judgment and order was challenged by filing the writ petition before the High Court. The High Court arrived at the conclusion that previous application filed by the appellant under the Debt Relief Act was decided against the appellant and it was held that the transaction was of sale and not of a mortgage. In such a situation, the principles of res-judicata would be attracted otherwise there would be no finality in the matter and the purchaser of the land would be subject to harassment all the time. Learned counsel Mr. Jain appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the aforesaid findings recorded by the High Court are, on the face of it, illegal and erroneous. He pointed out that the amplitude of the ’prohibited transaction’ under the Act is much wider than what is provided under the Debt Relief Act. As against this, learned senior counsel Mr. Gambhir submitted that the High Court rightly arrived at the conclusion that the present proceedings are barred by the principles of res-judicata in view of the previous decision whereby the application filed by the appellant was rejected and it was held that the transaction between the parties was not a mortgage but outright sale. For appreciating the contention raised by the parties, we would first refer to Preamble as well as Section 2(f) of the Act 1977, which are as under : ""An Act to better economic condition of holders of agricultural land in the weaker sections of the people by providing further relief from agricultural indebtedness by nullifying the land grabbing designs resorted to in many a form by lenders of money while and after extending credit to them and matters connected therewith. Whereas a holder of agricultural land in the weaker sections of the people is quite often compelled to seek loan from private money lending agencies to meet his various obligations of urgent nature; And whereas such private agencies seldom if ever advance loan to him without security of land, his only wherewithal; And whereas due to ignorance of niceties of law or urgency of financial need or both, he falls an easy prey to them scarcely realizing the legal consequences arising out of the documents which he executes or which they get executed from him seemingly by way of security for the loan; And whereas it is necessary to relieve the holders of agricultural land in  Page 3 of 6 the weaker sections of the people from such exploitation by nullifying such past transactions of loan as also to put a stop to such transactions"". 2. Definitions. - In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, (f) ""prohibited transaction of loan"" means a transaction in which a lender of money advances loan to a holder of agricultural land against security of his interest in land, whether at the time of advancing the loan or at any time thereafter during the currency of the loan in any of the following modes, namely : (i) agreement to sell land with or without delivery of possession; (ii) outright sale of land with or without delevery of possession accompanied by separate agreement to re-sell it; (iii) outright sale of land with or without delivery of possession with a distinct oral understanding that the sale shall not be acted upon if the loan is re-paid; (iv) outright sale of land with or without delivery of possesion with a condition incorporated in the sale deed to re-sell it on re-payment of the loan; (v) transaction in any modes other than those specified in clauses (i) to (iv) affecting interest in land including a fraudulent transaction or a transaction designed to defeat the provisions of any law regulating money lending or interest, for the time being in force, and includes all those transactions in which a lender of money has, after the appointed day but on or before the date of publication of this Act in the Gazette, obtained possession of land of the holder of agricultural land through court or by force or otherwise or obtained a decree for such possession towards satisfaction of loan."" (i) the amount of principal money, From the aforequoted preamble of the Act, it is amply clear that the object of the Act is to provide further relief to the weaker sections of the people agriculturists from agricultural indebtedness by nullifying the land grabbing designs resorted to by the money lenders while and after extending credit to them. Section 2(f) defines the phrase ""prohibited transaction of loan"" and inter alia declares that a transaction of outright sale of land would also be covered by the phrase ""prohibited transaction of loan"" if there was a distinct oral understanding that the sale shall not be acted upon if the loan is repaid. Further, Section 6 provides for enquiry to be carried out by Sub-Divisional Officer on an application which may be filed by an holder of agricultural land who belongs to weaker section of the people. Sub-section (4) of Section 6 provides that, in that enquiry, for the purpose of ascertaining the true nature of transaction of loan, SDO shall collect, as far as may be, information with respect to the following facts, namely : (ii) the market value of the land at the time of transaction; (iii) adequacy of the amount of principal money as consideration for sale in the context of then market value under clause (ii); (iv) whether the consideration shown in the document was paid in whole or in part privately or before the Sub-Registrar. (v) whether possession of the land was actually delivered to the lender of money as per recitals in the said document. If not, when and in what manner the lender of money obtained possession of the land; (vi) what were the terms of the actual agreement between the lender of  Page 4 of 6 money and the holder of agricultural land including the rate of interest; (vii) the extent of urgency for the loan and the availability of other sources to the holder of agricultural land to obtain the same; (viii) payment, if any, made by the holder of agricultural land to the lender of money towards the loan; (ix) whether the lender of money is registered money lender or not; (x) any other surrounding circumstances which the Sub-Divisional Officer may deem fit to consider. Thereafter, Section 7 inter alia provides that if after enquiry, the SDO is satisfied that the transaction of loan in substance is a prohibited transaction of loan, he shall declare such transaction to be void and pass an order setting aside the transfer of land to the lender of money consequently restoring the possession of land to the holder of the agricultural land. After following the aforesaid procedure, the authorities below arrived at the conclusion that during currency of loan transaction, sale deed was executed by the appellant in favour of respondent No. 2. The SDO also arrived at the conclusion that there was a distinct oral understanding that the sale shall not be acted upon if the loan is repaid. For this purpose, SDO took into consideration that the appellant was indebted for a sum of Rs. 2000/- and thereafter he took further loan of Rs. 500 and for the said amount sale deed was executed. It is stated in the sale-deed that appellant was agriculturist and the sale consideration was Rs. 2500 but it is not mentioned that amount of Rs. 2500 was paid in cash. He arrived at the conclusion that market value of the land at the relevant time was more than Rs. 7000/-. Admittedly, the appellant belongs to Bagri community which is a Schedule Tribe. He was entitled to get the benefit under the Act, if the transfer was for the loan amount with distinct oral understandings as stated above. Therefore, it cannot be said that the order passed by the SDO which was confirmed in apeal by the Additional Collector was, in any way, erroneous on facts. The next question would be - whether the present proceedings are barred by principles of res-judicata presuming that principles of res-judicata are applicable to such proceedings. For appreciating this contention, it would be necessary to refer to the relevant provisions of the Debt Relief Act, under which previous application was filed for relieving the appellant from the debt incurred by him. Under the said Act, definition of the debt is given under Section 2(4), which reads as under : ""2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires : (4) ""Debt"" includes; (i) all liabilities owing to a creditor in cash, or kind, secured or unsecured, payable under a decree or order of a Civil Court or otherwise, and subsisting on the appointed date whether due or not due; (ii) arrears of wages or salary subsisting on the appointed date."" Section 8 of Debt Relief Act provides for filing of an application by the creditor and also the debtor. If the creditor has not filed his claim application against the debtor, sub-section (4) of Section 8 provides that debtor is discharged from his liability. Sub-section (3) empowers the debtor also to apply to the Debt Relief Court. Section 14 provides that the Court shall calculate the interest in accordance with the rate specified in  Page 5 of 6 the First Schedule or such lower rate of interest as may have been agreed between the parties. Section 14(4) also empowers the Debt Relief Court of reduce the principal amount determined under sub-section (1) in accordance with Second Schedule appended to the Act. Thereafter, the Act further provides for preparation of a scheme of repayment of the debt. Hence, it is apparent that the provisions of the Debt Relief Act and the Act of 1977 operate in different fields. Debt Relief Act provides for relief to the debtor, who belongs to Schedule Tribe by scaling down the principal amount and the rate of interest as provided under the Schedule. As against this, the Act of 1977 is of wider amplitude and even if there is outright sale transaction by a debtor, it would be considered to be prohibited transaction of ’loan’ and that can be declared null and void under the provisions of the Act. The Legislature has specifically stated in the preamble that the Act was for providing further relief to the holders of agricultural land from agricultural indebtedness by nullifying the land grabbing designs resorted to by money lenders. Therefore, it provides not only for nullifying of mortgage deeds but also outright sale of land if conditions mentioned therein are satisfied. Further, the relief which is required to be granted under the provisions of the Act of 1977 is altogether different from the relief which is granted under the Debt Relief Act. One provides for declaring the sale transaction to be null and void while other provides only for scaling down the amount of the debt and the interest. Therefore, even in the previous proceedings if it is held that the transaction was not a mortgage but a sale, that would not mean that in the present proceedings, the appellant can not prove that the sale deed was executed for the loan amount with a specific understanding that on refund of the amount, property was to be redelivered to the transferor. In this view of the matter, even though in a previous proceeding there was a specific finding that the deed was not a mortgage deed (which is a fact), the present proceeding would not be barred by the principles of res-judicata. The cause of action and reliefs in the first and second proceedings are altogether different. This is also provided under Section 3 of the Act of 1977 by giving over-riding effect to the provisions of the Act. It inter alia provides that the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force. The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that enquiry held by the SDO was defective. In our view, no such contention was raised before the Additional Collector who heard the appeal. In any set of circumstances, from the written submissions which are reproduced in the judgment and order passed by the SDO, no such contention is appeared to have been taken. Hence, this contention is without any substance. Learned counsel for the respondents lastly submitted that these appeals abate as the appellant has not brought on record all the heirs of the deceased respondent no. 1 as party-respondents. In the present case, it is admitted fact that the sale-deed were executed in favour of respondent No. 2. who is the son of deceased respondent No 1. The sale transaction was between the appellant and respondent No. 2. No doubt, it was for a loan given by respondent No. 1 but the question involved in this proceeding is for declaration of sale deed executed in favour of respondent No. 2 to be null and void and that can be granted even without bringing on record the other heirs of respondent No. 1. In the alternative, from the facts of the present case, it has been rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant that the estate is fully represented by respondent No. 2. Hence, there is no question of abatement of appeal. In this view of the matter, we have thought it fit not to issue notice to remaining legal heirs of respondent No. 1 on an application filed by the appellant. In the result, the appeals are allowed. The impugned judgments and orders passed by the High Court are set aside and quashed. The judgment and order  Page 6 of 6 passed by the SDO is restored. There shall be no order as to costs."

32,,LIFE INSURANCE CORPORATION OF INDIA & ANR.,SHRI DHARAM VIR ANAND,SHRI DHARAM VIR ANAND,"M.M. PUNCHHI, G.B. PATTANAIK, A.P. MISRA","JUDGMENT: J U D G M E N T G.B.PATTANAIK, J. Leave granted. This appeal by special leave is directed against the Order of the National Consumer Disputers Redressal Commission, New Delhi dated 30th of March, 1998, dismissing the revision filed by the appellant and confirming the decision of the State Forum, who in turn affirmed the decision of District Forum. The question that arises for consideration in this appeal is whether under Clause 4B of the policy the date of the policy is the date on which the policy was issued or the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced. The aforesaid question arises under the following circumstances. The respondent took a policy of life Insurance on the life of his minor daughter Kumari Rajan Anand. The proposal was submitted on 25.3.90 and the policy was issued on 31.3.90. The policy contained a Clause, Clause 4B which reeds as follows : Claused 4-B ""Notwithstanding anything mentioned to the contrary, it is hereby declared and agreed that in the event of death of Life assured occuring as a result of intentional selfinjury, suicide or attempted suicide, insanity, accident other than an accident in a public place or murder at any time on or after the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced but before the expiry of three years from the date of this policy, the Corporation’s liability shall be Limited to the sum equal to the total amount of premiums (exclusive extra of premiums, if any), paid under the policy without Interest. Provided that in case the Life Assured shall commit suicide before the expiry of one year reckoned from the date of this policy, the provisions of the Clause under the heading ""Suicide"" printed on the back of the policy."" The insurer called upon the insured to indicate whether the policy is to be backdated and if so, the date   of 4 from which it should be dated back. The Insured indicated that the policy should be dated back to 10.5.89 and the premium for the period 10.5.89 till 25.3.1990 was accordingly paid. The policy was issued to the Insured on 25.3.90. The minor girl whose life had been insured under the policy committed suicide on 15.11.1992. The respondent thereafter lodged a claim for payment of the entire sum for which life of the deceased had been insured. The Corporation gave a reply to the respondent that his claim for the full sum assured could not be entertained as the assured had committed suicide within three years of the date of the issue of policy and Clause 4B of the policy would be attracted. The respondent then filed a complaint under Section 12 of the Consumer Disputers Act contending inter alia that the risk under the policy having commences w.e.f. 10.5.89 and the assured having committed suicide on 15.11.92, Clause 4-B will not apply and therefore, the entire sum for which the life of the minor girl had been insured should be paid to the respondent together with the Bonus and interest which accrued due. The appellant took the stand before the District Forum contending that though risk under the policy has commenced w.e.f. 10.5.89 but the date of the policy is 31.3.90 and therefore, death of the assured having occurred before expiry of three years from the date of the policy, the liability of the Corporation shall be limited to the sum equal to the total amount of premium paid under the policy as per Clause 4-B of the terms of policy. The District Forum however rejected the contention of the appellant and being of the view that the policy in the eye of law having commenced w.e.f. 10.5.89, the three years period under Clause 4_B of the policy would run from the said date and not from the date of issuance of the policy and, therefore, the Corporation cannot have a limited liability as per Clause 4-B of the policy. The said view of the District Forum was upheld in appeal by the State Forum as well as in revision by the National Forum and hence the present appeal. Mr. Salve, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that Clause 4-B itself has used the two expressions namely ""the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced"" and ""the date of the policy"" and, therefore, the said two expressions cannot have the one and the same meaning. According to Mr. Salve, the date of the policy is the date on which the policy is issued though for the purpose for given certain tax relief the Insurer has allowed the proposal to have the policy dated back w.e.f 10.5.89 and on such an interpretation being given and the assured having committed suicide before the expiry of three years of the date of the policy, Clause 4-B is squarely attracted and, therefore, the Corporation will have a limited liability. Mr. Salve, the learned Senior Counsel further contended that if the expression the date of the policy"" and the expression ""the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced"" is given one and the same meaning then in a case where a policy is dated back, the proviso in Clause 4-B will not operate and such a situation would not have been intended by the parties to the agreement. According to Mr. Salve, while construing a policy of insurance which is nothing but an agreement between the parties the commercial practice cannot be ignored and, therefore, the dating back of the policy being merely to confer certain in tax to the insured, the date of the dating back cannot be held to be the date of the policy itself. Mr. Chadha, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent on the other hand submitted that the insured having being called upon to indicate as to whether the policy  Page 3 of 4 should be dated back and if so, to indicate the date with effect form which such dating back is ti operate and the Insured having indicated the same and thereafter the entire premium from the date form which the policy commenced having been paid by the Insured and accepted by the Insurer, there is no reason to construe the date of the policy to be the date on which the policy was issued. According to Mr. Chadha, the date of the policy must be held to be the date on which the policy has commenced and on being construed in this manner the death of the assured having taken place after three years from the date of the policy, Clause 4-B will not be attracted and, therefore, the appellant Company will be liable to pay the entire sum for which the life has been insured together with interest thereon and the Forums under the Act did not commit any error in allowing the claim of the respondent. Having examined the rival submissions and having examined the policy of insurance which is nothing but a contract between parties and having considered the expressions used in Clause 4-B of the terms of policy we are persuaded to accept the submissions made by Mr. Salve, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant. In construing a particular Clause of the Contract it is only reasonable to construe that the word and the terms used therein must be given effect to. In other words one part of the Contract cannot be made otiose by giving a meaning to the policy of the contract. Then again when the same Clause of a contract uses two different expressions, ordinarily those different expressions conveying one and the same meaning. Bearing in mind the aforesaid principle of construction, if Clause 4-B of the terms of policy is scrutinized, it become crystal clear that the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced is different from the date of the policy. In the case in hand undoubtedly the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced is 10.5.89 but the date of the policy is 31st of March, 19990 on which date the policy had been issued. Even though the Insurer had given the option to the Insured indicated that the policy should be dated back to 10.5.89 and did pay the premium for that period, thereby the risk under the policy can be said to have commenced with effect from 10.5.89 but the date of the policy still remains the date on which the policy was issued i.e. 31st of March, 1990. The death of the life assured having occurred as a result of suicide committed by the assured before the expiry of three years from the date of the policy, the terms contained in Clause 4-B of the policy would be attracted and, therefore, the liability of the Corporation would be limited to the sum equal to the total amount of premium paid under the policy without interest and not the entire sum for which the life had been insured. The Forums under the Consumer Protection Act committed gross error in construing Clause 4-B of the policy and given the same meaning to the two expressions in the aforesaid Clause 4-B namely ""the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced"" and the date of the policy"". The construction given by us to the provisions contained in Clause 4-B get support, if the proviso to Clause 4-B is looked into. Under the proviso if the life assured commits suicide before expiry of one year reckoned from the date of the policy then the provisions of the Clause under the heading ""suicide"" printed on the back of the policy would apply. In a case therefore a policy is dated back for one year prior to the date of the issue of the policy the proviso contained in Clause 4-B cannot be operated at all. When parties had agreed to the terms of the contract it is impermissible to hold that a  Page 4 of 4 particular term was never intended to be acted upon. The proviso to Clause 4-B will have its full play if the expression ""the date of the policy"" is interpreted to mean the date on which the policy was issued and not the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced. In the aforesaid premises we are of the considered opinion that under Clause 4-B of the policy the date of the policy is the date on which the policy had been issued and not the date on which the risk under the policy had commenced by way of allowing dated back. In view of our aforesaid construction to Clause 4-B, in the case in hand the respondent in law would be entitled to only the sum equal to the total amount of premium paid under the policy without any interest inasmuch as the death of the life assured has occurred before the expiry of three years from the date of the policy i.e. 31.3.1990. Even though we have construed the provisions of Clause 4-B as aforesaid but so far the amount of compensation payable to the respondent is concerned we find from the letter of the Corporation dated 2.2.1995 that the Claims Review Committee has examined the facts of the case and had decided to pay a sum of Rupees two lacs on ex-gratia basis and we see no reason why the respondent should not be entitled to receive the said amount together with the interest thereon. The said offer of the Corporation having been made on 2nd of February, 1995 and more than three and half year having been elapsed since then, we think that the Corporation-appellant should pay a total sum of three lacs to the respondent-claimant in full satisfaction of the claim of the respondent and this amount should be paid within eight weeks from today. This appeal is disposed of accordingly","JUDGMENT: J U D G M E N T G.B.PATTANAIK, J. Leave granted. This appeal by special leave is directed against the Order of the National Consumer Disputers Redressal Commission, New Delhi dated 30th of March, 1998, dismissing the revision filed by the appellant and confirming the decision of the State Forum, who in turn affirmed the decision of District Forum. The question that arises for consideration in this appeal is whether under Clause 4B of the policy the date of the policy is the date on which the policy was issued or the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced. The aforesaid question arises under the following circumstances. The respondent took a policy of life Insurance on the life of his minor daughter Kumari Rajan Anand. The proposal was submitted on 25.3.90 and the policy was issued on 31.3.90. The policy contained a Clause, Clause 4B which reeds as follows : Claused 4-B ""Notwithstanding anything mentioned to the contrary, it is hereby declared and agreed that in the event of death of Life assured occuring as a result of intentional selfinjury, suicide or attempted suicide, insanity, accident other than an accident in a public place or murder at any time on or after the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced but before the expiry of three years from the date of this policy, the Corporation’s liability shall be Limited to the sum equal to the total amount of premiums (exclusive extra of premiums, if any), paid under the policy without Interest. Provided that in case the Life Assured shall commit suicide before the expiry of one year reckoned from the date of this policy, the provisions of the Clause under the heading ""Suicide"" printed on the back of the policy."" The insurer called upon the insured to indicate whether the policy is to be backdated and if so, the date   of 4 from which it should be dated back. The Insured indicated that the policy should be dated back to 10.5.89 and the premium for the period 10.5.89 till 25.3.1990 was accordingly paid. The policy was issued to the Insured on 25.3.90. The minor girl whose life had been insured under the policy committed suicide on 15.11.1992. The respondent thereafter lodged a claim for payment of the entire sum for which life of the deceased had been insured. The Corporation gave a reply to the respondent that his claim for the full sum assured could not be entertained as the assured had committed suicide within three years of the date of the issue of policy and Clause 4B of the policy would be attracted. The respondent then filed a complaint under Section 12 of the Consumer Disputers Act contending inter alia that the risk under the policy having commences w.e.f. 10.5.89 and the assured having committed suicide on 15.11.92, Clause 4-B will not apply and therefore, the entire sum for which the life of the minor girl had been insured should be paid to the respondent together with the Bonus and interest which accrued due. The appellant took the stand before the District Forum contending that though risk under the policy has commenced w.e.f. 10.5.89 but the date of the policy is 31.3.90 and therefore, death of the assured having occurred before expiry of three years from the date of the policy, the liability of the Corporation shall be limited to the sum equal to the total amount of premium paid under the policy as per Clause 4-B of the terms of policy. The District Forum however rejected the contention of the appellant and being of the view that the policy in the eye of law having commenced w.e.f. 10.5.89, the three years period under Clause 4_B of the policy would run from the said date and not from the date of issuance of the policy and, therefore, the Corporation cannot have a limited liability as per Clause 4-B of the policy. The said view of the District Forum was upheld in appeal by the State Forum as well as in revision by the National Forum and hence the present appeal. Mr. Salve, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that Clause 4-B itself has used the two expressions namely ""the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced"" and ""the date of the policy"" and, therefore, the said two expressions cannot have the one and the same meaning. According to Mr. Salve, the date of the policy is the date on which the policy is issued though for the purpose for given certain tax relief the Insurer has allowed the proposal to have the policy dated back w.e.f 10.5.89 and on such an interpretation being given and the assured having committed suicide before the expiry of three years of the date of the policy, Clause 4-B is squarely attracted and, therefore, the Corporation will have a limited liability. Mr. Salve, the learned Senior Counsel further contended that if the expression the date of the policy"" and the expression ""the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced"" is given one and the same meaning then in a case where a policy is dated back, the proviso in Clause 4-B will not operate and such a situation would not have been intended by the parties to the agreement. According to Mr. Salve, while construing a policy of insurance which is nothing but an agreement between the parties the commercial practice cannot be ignored and, therefore, the dating back of the policy being merely to confer certain in tax to the insured, the date of the dating back cannot be held to be the date of the policy itself. Mr. Chadha, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent on the other hand submitted that the insured having being called upon to indicate as to whether the policy  Page 3 of 4 should be dated back and if so, to indicate the date with effect form which such dating back is ti operate and the Insured having indicated the same and thereafter the entire premium from the date form which the policy commenced having been paid by the Insured and accepted by the Insurer, there is no reason to construe the date of the policy to be the date on which the policy was issued. According to Mr. Chadha, the date of the policy must be held to be the date on which the policy has commenced and on being construed in this manner the death of the assured having taken place after three years from the date of the policy, Clause 4-B will not be attracted and, therefore, the appellant Company will be liable to pay the entire sum for which the life has been insured together with interest thereon and the Forums under the Act did not commit any error in allowing the claim of the respondent. Having examined the rival submissions and having examined the policy of insurance which is nothing but a contract between parties and having considered the expressions used in Clause 4-B of the terms of policy we are persuaded to accept the submissions made by Mr. Salve, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant. In construing a particular Clause of the Contract it is only reasonable to construe that the word and the terms used therein must be given effect to. In other words one part of the Contract cannot be made otiose by giving a meaning to the policy of the contract. Then again when the same Clause of a contract uses two different expressions, ordinarily those different expressions conveying one and the same meaning. Bearing in mind the aforesaid principle of construction, if Clause 4-B of the terms of policy is scrutinized, it become crystal clear that the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced is different from the date of the policy. In the case in hand undoubtedly the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced is 10.5.89 but the date of the policy is 31st of March, 19990 on which date the policy had been issued. Even though the Insurer had given the option to the Insured indicated that the policy should be dated back to 10.5.89 and did pay the premium for that period, thereby the risk under the policy can be said to have commenced with effect from 10.5.89 but the date of the policy still remains the date on which the policy was issued i.e. 31st of March, 1990. The death of the life assured having occurred as a result of suicide committed by the assured before the expiry of three years from the date of the policy, the terms contained in Clause 4-B of the policy would be attracted and, therefore, the liability of the Corporation would be limited to the sum equal to the total amount of premium paid under the policy without interest and not the entire sum for which the life had been insured. The Forums under the Consumer Protection Act committed gross error in construing Clause 4-B of the policy and given the same meaning to the two expressions in the aforesaid Clause 4-B namely ""the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced"" and the date of the policy"". The construction given by us to the provisions contained in Clause 4-B get support, if the proviso to Clause 4-B is looked into. Under the proviso if the life assured commits suicide before expiry of one year reckoned from the date of the policy then the provisions of the Clause under the heading ""suicide"" printed on the back of the policy would apply. In a case therefore a policy is dated back for one year prior to the date of the issue of the policy the proviso contained in Clause 4-B cannot be operated at all. When parties had agreed to the terms of the contract it is impermissible to hold that a  Page 4 of 4 particular term was never intended to be acted upon. The proviso to Clause 4-B will have its full play if the expression ""the date of the policy"" is interpreted to mean the date on which the policy was issued and not the date on which the risk under the policy has commenced. In the aforesaid premises we are of the considered opinion that under Clause 4-B of the policy the date of the policy is the date on which the policy had been issued and not the date on which the risk under the policy had commenced by way of allowing dated back. In view of our aforesaid construction to Clause 4-B, in the case in hand the respondent in law would be entitled to only the sum equal to the total amount of premium paid under the policy without any interest inasmuch as the death of the life assured has occurred before the expiry of three years from the date of the policy i.e. 31.3.1990.

33,Appeal (civil) 6046-58 of 2003,State of Punjab & Ors.,Satnam Kaur & Ors.,16/12/2005,S.B. Sinha & P.P. Naolekar,"J U D G M E N T S.B. SINHA, J : The State of Punjab is in appeal before us being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with a judgment and order dated 10.01.2002 passed by a Division Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court allowing the writ petitions filed by the Respondents herein. On or about 07.05.1997, the Civil Surgeon, Nawanshahr issued an advertisement in ’New Zamana’, Jalandhar, inviting applications for the following 31 posts : (1) Ward Servant 15 (2) Sweeper 08 (3) Mali 02 (4) Cook 04 (5) Aaya 01 (6) Dental Attendant 01 A large number of candidates being more than 9000 applied for appointments in the said posts pursuant to or in furtherance of the said advertisement. Interviews of about 1000 persons were conducted on 12/13.05.1997. Appointment letters to the so-called candidates were despatched on 05.06.1997 and they were allowed to join on 06.06.1997. A writ petition was filed by some unsuccessful candidates, which was marked as Civil Writ Petition No.11116 of 1997, wherein 18 of the selected candidates were made parties. The entire selection process as well as the selection of the said respondents were questioned, inter alia, on the ground that their names were recommended by one or the other influential persons or they had otherwise access to the Civil Surgeon concerned. In the said writ petition, it was, inter alia, prayed : ""i) to issue a writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing the selection of Class IV employee in the civil hospital Nawanshahr vide selection list Annexure P/3 and further to order quashing the appointment of respondent No.4 to 21 against the post (in class IV) and to issue writ of mandamus directing the respondents No. 1 to 3 to appoint the petitioner as Class IV employees in the civil hospital, Nawanshahr."" A Division Bench of the High Court by a judgment and order dated 10.11.2000 perused the records pertaining to the process of selection and the results thereof and was of the opinion that although no criteria whatsoever was fixed for evaluating the marks which were to be given to each individual   of 5 candidate but despite the same 5 marks had been awarded for the purported qualification and experience to each candidate while 20 marks had been fixed for interview. It was noticed : ""\005It may also be mentioned here that according to the notification which was issued on 7th May, 1997, it was indicated that (i) the candidate should be able to read write, Punjabi and (ii) the experience shall be given preference. In view of this it is apparent that the committee which was conducting the interview was given no guidelines which were to be followed by them by evaluating the worth of any candidate it had an absolute and arbitrary discretion regarding how they were to access and award marks during the time of interview Further more it is also evident that out of a total of 30 marks that were to be awarded, 20 marks have been earmarked for the interview which shows that more than 66% marks were to be given by the member of the board without any parameter having been fixed awarding thereof. No material has been placed before us to show that how 20 marks were to be awarded by the five members of the Board nor it is clear that how the marks have actually been awarded\005"" The High Court further noticed the manner in which discriminatory treatment had been made in awarding the marks to the persons similarly situated. It was also not clear to the High Court as to how the merit list was prepared. It was observed : ""\005One fails to see how a person been the basic qualifications, above to read and write Punjabi could have been awarded 1 marks not here is anything to indicate that on what basis various candidates have been awarded more marks once the advertisement did not provide for preference being given to candidates having higher qualifications."" It was noticed that even while awarding marks for experience candidates were awarded marks from 0 to 15. It was further held : ""\005It is also not clear from the lists, as already indicated above by us, as to how the member of the Board had awarded marks and the participations made by each of those members during the interview as would have been the case if each of them had been required to give their assessment out of 4 marks or each of them had been required to evaluate each candidate after giving him marks of 20 and then an average had been drawn up\005"" The High Court wondered that even if one minute was spent on one candidate and if one more minute was required for another candidate to come in and go out, at least 2000 minutes would be required for interviewing 1000 candidates and, thus, there was no reason as to why only 2 dates had been fixed for interview; and even if the members of the Selection Board sat for 5 to 6 hours a day, they would not have been able to finish the interview of so many candidates, observing : ""\005.This would bring the projected time which the Board wanted to spend on interview of one candidate to less than 30 seconds, which would include the time for calling in of a candidate, making him sit down, ask him questions and then requesting him to leave.""  Page 3 of 5 The High Court, therefore, set aside the selection made by the Board. The State did not prefer any appeal thereagainst. One Jaswinder Lal preferred a special leave petition thereagainst and this Court by an order dated 12.02.2001 passed in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 2115 of 2001, dismissed the said petition, opining : ""We have not got the slightest doubt in the greatest abuse of power by the officer concerned. The High Court is entirely correct in taking the decision which it did. The Special Leave Petition dismissed."" The State of Punjab thereafter by an order dated 23.04.2001 cancelled the appointments of all the 31 candidates. The respondents herein questioned the said order by filing writ petitions before the Punjab & Haryana High Court, inter alia, contending that as they had been appointed on an ad hoc basis long back, they were asked to appear before the Interview Board only for the purpose of regularization of their services. It was further contended that as they were not parties in the earlier writ petition, they were not bound by the said decision and in that view of the matter the State could not have cancelled their appointments. A Division Bench of the High Court allowed the said writ petitions holding that the services of the respondents herein should have been regularized purported to be under the Government instructions dated 18.01.1995, whereby and whereunder the services of ad hoc Class IV employees were to be regularized if they had completed the period of 240 days on 31.12.1994. Mr. Sarup Singh, the learned Senior Additional Advocate General, appearing for the State of Punjab, in assailing the judgment, would contend that the High Court committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment relying on or on the basis of a judgment of this Court in T. Devadasan v. Union of India and Anr. [AIR 1964 SC 179], which has no application in the instant case. It was furthermore submitted that in view of the fact that High Court in the writ petition quashed the entire selection process, the State had no other option but to terminate the services of all the selected candidates, although the respondents herein were not parties thereto. Mr. Gurnam Singh, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents herein, on the other hand, would support the judgment of the High Court, contending that the respondents herein had continued in service for a number of years after their appointment. It was urged that the respondents herein were appointed long back and, thus, in terms of the policy decision of the State their services were to be regularized. It was further submitted that as the respondents herein were not parties in the earlier writ petition, the said judgment was not binding on them. Reliance in this behalf, has been placed on Prabodh Verma & Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. [(1985) 2 SLR 714 : AIR 1985 SC 167]. The learned counsel relying on or on the basis of a judgment of this Court in Arun Tewari and Others v. Zila Mansavi Shikshak Sangh and Others [(1998) 2 SCC 332] would contend that in all cases, it is not necessary to follow all the procedures laid down in the rules. It was not a case where the High Court, in our opinion, could have interfered with the order dated 23.04.2001 passed by the appellant herein. We have noticed hereinbefore the findings of the High Court arrived in Writ Petition No.11116 of 1997 for the purpose of setting aside the entire  Page 4 of 5 selection process. It is true that in the said writ petition only 18 out of 31 selected candidates were made parties, but they were made parties because an additional ground was taken by the writ petitioners therein that their cases were recommended by some influential persons or they were otherwise known to the Civil Surgeon, Nawanshahr. The main prayer in the said writ petition, however, was that the entire selection process was bad in law. Once the High Court was of the opinion that the entire selection process was bad in law and the said order having been upheld by this Court, in our opinion, it was impermissible to bye-pass the same. The contention of the respondents herein that they were entitled to be regularized in services was not a matter which had a direct nexus with the order of termination of their services passed by the State. Indisputably, they took part in the selection process. Indisputably again such selection process was initiated pursuant to the advertisement issued by the Civil Surgeon, Nawanshahr. Once the respondents herein had participated in the selection process and became selected, they could not have filed a writ petition on a different premise, namely, they having been appointed on ad hoc basis long time back, their services should have been regularized pursuant to or in furtherance of a purported policy decision dated 18.01.1995. The High Court in its judgment and order dated 10.11.2000 clearly noted that an advertisement was issued in a local newspaper and pursuant thereto about 9000 candidates filed their applications. Out of the said 9000 candidates, 1000 candidates were interviewed. The respondents herein do not say that they were not amongst the said 1000 candidates. It is not their contentions that they were not interviewed on 12/13.05. 1997. It was further not disputed that appointment letters in their favour were issued on 05.06.1997 and they joined their respective posts on 06.06.1997. In the aforementioned premise, it was impermissible for the respondents herein to file the writ petition contending that they appeared before the Selection Board in connection with regularization of their services. The High Court for all intent and purport, thus, sought to bye-pass its own binding judgment as also the order of this Court. Moreover, the effect of such judgments did not fall for discussion by the High Court. The effect of non-joinder of the respondents would not be such which would confer a legal right upon them to file another writ petition whereby and whereunder the effect of the earlier judgment would be completely wiped out. In Prabodh Verma (supra),this Court in the factual matrix obtaining therein was of the view that the High Court ought not to have heard or disposed of the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In the instant case, 18 persons were impleaded as respondents in their individual as also representative capacity. Even if the respondents were aggrieved, they could have come before this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. Even a review petition at their instance was maintainable. Prior to issuance of letter of termination dated 23.04.2001, they questioned the order of termination only. Such order of termination cannot be said to be in any manner vitiated in law as the same had been issued pursuant to or in furtherance of a lawful judgment passed by the High Court and affirmed by this Court. It was a duty of the High Court to follow the decision of this Court. In Dwarikesh Sugar Industries Ltd. v. Prem Heavy Engineering Works (P) Ltd. And Another [(1997) 6 SCC 450], it was held : ""When a position, in law, is well settled as a result of judicial pronouncement of this Court, it would amount to judicial impropriety to say the least, for the subordinate courts including the High Courts to ignore the settled decisions and then to pass a judicial order which is clearly contrary to the settled legal position. Such judicial adventurism cannot be permitted and we strongly deprecate the tendency of the subordinate courts in not applying the settled principles and in passing whimsical  Page 5 of 5 orders which necessarily has the effect of granting wrongful and unwarranted relief to one of the parties. It is time that this tendency stops."" [See also Ajay Kumar Bhuyan and Ors. etc. v. State of Orissa and Ors. etc. (2003) 1 SCC 707]. Yet again in M/s D. Navinchandra and Co., Bombay v. Union of India and Ors. [(1987) 3 SCC 66], Mukharji, J (as His Lordship then was) speaking for a three-Judge Bench of this Court stated the law in the following terms : ""\005Generally legal positions laid down by the court would be binding on all concerned even though some of them have not been made parties nor were served nor any notice of such proceedings given."" The decision of this Court in Arun Tewari (supra) relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents herein, has no application in the instant case. The question which was raised therein was absolutely different and distinct. Therein the selection process was held to be valid having regard to the fact that 7000 posts of Assistant Teachers under a time-bound scheme were to be filled up wherein the rules were amended. This Court in that situation observed : ""There are different methods of inviting applications. The method adopted in the exigencies of the situation in the present case cannot be labelled as unfair, particularly when, at the relevant time, the two earlier decisions of this Court were in vogue."" In the instant case, what was commended by the High Court and this Court was not the validity or otherwise of the advertisement issued in the press but the mode and manner in which the selection of the candidates was held. For the aforementioned reasons, we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment is unsustainable in law, which is set aside accordingly. The appeal is allowed. No costs","J U D G M E N T S.B. SINHA, J : The State of Punjab is in appeal before us being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with a judgment and order dated 10.01.2002 passed by a Division Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court allowing the writ petitions filed by the Respondents herein.

One Jaswinder Lal preferred a special leave petition thereagainst and this Court by an order dated 12.02.2001 passed in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 2115 of 2001, dismissed the said petition, opining : ""We have not got the slightest doubt in the greatest abuse of power by the officer concerned. The High Court is entirely correct in taking the decision which it did. The Special Leave Petition dismissed."" The State of Punjab thereafter by an order dated 23.04.2001 cancelled the appointments of all the 31 candidates. The respondents herein questioned the said order by filing writ petitions before the Punjab & Haryana High Court, inter alia, contending that as they had been appointed on an ad hoc basis long back, they were asked to appear before the Interview Board only for the purpose of regularization of their services. It was further contended that as they were not parties in the earlier writ petition, they were not bound by the said decision and in that view of the matter the State could not have cancelled their appointments. A Division Bench of the High Court allowed the said writ petitions holding that the services of the respondents herein should have been regularized purported to be under the Government instructions dated 18.01.1995, whereby and whereunder the services of ad hoc Class IV employees were to be regularized if they had completed the period of 240 days on 31.12.1994. Mr. Sarup Singh, the learned Senior Additional Advocate General, appearing for the State of Punjab, in assailing the judgment, would contend that the High Court committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment relying on or on the basis of a judgment of this Court in T. Devadasan v. Union of India and Anr. [AIR 1964 SC 179], which has no application in the instant case. It was furthermore submitted that in view of the fact that High Court in the writ petition quashed the entire selection process, the State had no other option but to terminate the services of all the selected candidates, although the respondents herein were not parties thereto. Mr. Gurnam Singh, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents herein, on the other hand, would support the judgment of the High Court, contending that the respondents herein had continued in service for a number of years after their appointment. It was urged that the respondents herein were appointed long back and, thus, in terms of the policy decision of the State their services were to be regularized. It was further submitted that as the respondents herein were not parties in the earlier writ petition, the said judgment was not binding on them. Reliance in this behalf, has been placed on Prabodh Verma & Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. [(1985) 2 SLR 714 : AIR 1985 SC 167]. The learned counsel relying on or on the basis of a judgment of this Court in Arun Tewari and Others v. Zila Mansavi Shikshak Sangh and Others [(1998) 2 SCC 332] would contend that in all cases, it is not necessary to follow all the procedures laid down in the rules. It was not a case where the High Court, in our opinion, could have interfered with the order dated 23.04.2001 passed by the appellant herein. We have noticed hereinbefore the findings of the High Court arrived in Writ Petition No.11116 of 1997 for the purpose of setting aside the entire  Page 4 of 5 selection process. It is true that in the said writ petition only 18 out of 31 selected candidates were made parties, but they were made parties because an additional ground was taken by the writ petitioners therein that their cases were recommended by some influential persons or they were otherwise known to the Civil Surgeon, Nawanshahr. The main prayer in the said writ petition, however, was that the entire selection process was bad in law. Once the High Court was of the opinion that the entire selection process was bad in law and the said order having been upheld by this Court, in our opinion, it was impermissible to bye-pass the same. The contention of the respondents herein that they were entitled to be regularized in services was not a matter which had a direct nexus with the order of termination of their services passed by the State. Indisputably, they took part in the selection process. Indisputably again such selection process was initiated pursuant to the advertisement issued by the Civil Surgeon, Nawanshahr. Once the respondents herein had participated in the selection process and became selected, they could not have filed a writ petition on a different premise, namely, they having been appointed on ad hoc basis long time back, their services should have been regularized pursuant to or in furtherance of a purported policy decision dated 18.01.1995. The High Court in its judgment and order dated 10.11.2000 clearly noted that an advertisement was issued in a local newspaper and pursuant thereto about 9000 candidates filed their applications. Out of the said 9000 candidates, 1000 candidates were interviewed. The respondents herein do not say that they were not amongst the said 1000 candidates. It is not their contentions that they were not interviewed on 12/13.05. 1997. It was further not disputed that appointment letters in their favour were issued on 05.06.1997 and they joined their respective posts on 06.06.1997. In the aforementioned premise, it was impermissible for the respondents herein to file the writ petition contending that they appeared before the Selection Board in connection with regularization of their services. The High Court for all intent and purport, thus, sought to bye-pass its own binding judgment as also the order of this Court. Moreover, the effect of such judgments did not fall for discussion by the High Court. The effect of non-joinder of the respondents would not be such which would confer a legal right upon them to file another writ petition whereby and whereunder the effect of the earlier judgment would be completely wiped out. In Prabodh Verma (supra),this Court in the factual matrix obtaining therein was of the view that the High Court ought not to have heard or disposed of the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In the instant case, 18 persons were impleaded as respondents in their individual as also representative capacity. Even if the respondents were aggrieved, they could have come before this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. Even a review petition at their instance was maintainable. Prior to issuance of letter of termination dated 23.04.2001, they questioned the order of termination only. Such order of termination cannot be said to be in any manner vitiated in law as the same had been issued pursuant to or in furtherance of a lawful judgment passed by the High Court and affirmed by this Court. It was a duty of the High Court to follow the decision of this Court. In Dwarikesh Sugar Industries Ltd. v. Prem Heavy Engineering Works (P) Ltd. And Another [(1997) 6 SCC 450], it was held : ""When a position, in law, is well settled as a result of judicial pronouncement of this Court, it would amount to judicial impropriety to say the least, for the subordinate courts including the High Courts to ignore the settled decisions and then to pass a judicial order which is clearly contrary to the settled legal position. Such judicial adventurism cannot be permitted and we strongly deprecate the tendency of the subordinate courts in not applying the settled principles and in passing whimsical  Page 5 of 5 orders which necessarily has the effect of granting wrongful and unwarranted relief to one of the parties. It is time that this tendency stops."" [See also Ajay Kumar Bhuyan and Ors. etc. v. State of Orissa and Ors. etc. (2003) 1 SCC 707]. Yet again in M/s D. Navinchandra and Co., Bombay v. Union of India and Ors. [(1987) 3 SCC 66], Mukharji, J (as His Lordship then was) speaking for a three-Judge Bench of this Court stated the law in the following terms : ""\005Generally legal positions laid down by the court would be binding on all concerned even though some of them have not been made parties nor were served nor any notice of such proceedings given."" The decision of this Court in Arun Tewari (supra) relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents herein, has no application in the instant case. The question which was raised therein was absolutely different and distinct. Therein the selection process was held to be valid having regard to the fact that 7000 posts of Assistant Teachers under a time-bound scheme were to be filled up wherein the rules were amended. This Court in that situation observed : ""There are different methods of inviting applications. The method adopted in the exigencies of the situation in the present case cannot be labelled as unfair, particularly when, at the relevant time, the two earlier decisions of this Court were in vogue."" In the instant case, what was commended by the High Court and this Court was not the validity or otherwise of the advertisement issued in the press but the mode and manner in which the selection of the candidates was held. For the aforementioned reasons, we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment is unsustainable in law, which is set aside accordingly. The appeal is allowed. No costs"

Leave granted. 2. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant. His claim relates to the post of Senior Administrative Grade. He filed OA 245 of 2001 before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Ahmedabad Bench (for short the ’Tribunal’). Before that he had moved OA 8639 of 1997 making the grievance that he was not granted the post of Chief Commercial Manager, Senior Administrative Grade from 1995. His stand was that the Minister of Railways had approved his promotion in the said grade, but the same was not given effect to by the respondents. OA was decided on merits by order dated 15.1.1999. While dismissing the OA, Tribunal had observed that the applicant was not entitled for promotion to the post of Chief Commercial Manager in the grade w.e.f. 1.1.1995. The appellant had preferred Special Civil Application No.10899 of 2000 before the Gujarat High Court and while dismissing the same, learned Single Judge had directed the respondents to decide the pending representation of the applicant for his promotion in the light of existing rules and regulations. 3. Subsequently, Misc. application no.132 of 2001 was moved by the appellant in the said Special Civil Application which was also rejected by the Division Bench on 7.3.2001 in view of the appellant making a statement that he would proceed before the appropriate forum in respect of the challenge. A speaking order was passed by the competent authority on the representation. Therefore, OA No.245 of 2001 was filed. Subsequently, prayer in the OA was for setting aside the order dated 2.2.2001 passed by the Member, Railway Board and for direction to the Railways authorities to consider his case for promotion w.e.f. 1996. 4. It is to be noted that the representation was rejected on the ground that though the Minister had initially approved his promotion to the Senior Administrative Grade, subsequently, by order dated 26.4.1997 he concurred with non-inclusion of his name in the panel. He was not   of 2 considered for promotion. Before the Tribunal stand of the respondent was that merely because the Minister had earlier recommended for inclusion of appellant’s name in the Senior Administrative Grade at an earlier stage, that did not confer any right to get promotion particularly when the same Minister had subsequently approved the exclusion of his name. 5. The stand of the appellant in support of the appeal is that once the Minister had approved inclusion of his name, there was no question of his subsequently disapproving the inclusion merely because it was brought to his notice that inclusion of his name was impermissible. 6. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the Departmental Promotion Committee ((in short ’DPC’) did not recommend appellant’s name. On his representation, the Minister directed his empanelment. Subsequently, when materials were placed before the Minister, he directed that there was no scope for empanelment of appellant. 7. At this juncture it is necessary to note that there was no challenge to the Minister’s subsequent order. From the records it is revealed that in the order of 1996, when DPC had referred the panel to the Minister for his approval, the name of the appellant was not included in the list. The Minister while approving the panel included the name of the appellant and then approved the panel. Subsequently, the Member, Special Railway Board, who was one of the members of the DPC, advised the Secretary, Railway Board, to place the matter before DPC for re-consideration in view of the observations made by the Minister. 8. Thereafter, DPC put up a detailed note indicating the reasons as to why the name of the appellant can not be included for promotion to Senior Administrative Grade. The Minister accepted the reasons given by the DPC for non inclusion and further approved the panel which did not figure appellant’s name. 9. It is not in dispute as per applicable provisions, the promotions have been granted. Appellant’s name was not recommended by the DPC and, therefore, he could not have been appointed. 10. Appellant’s stand is that once the Minister had directed inclusion of his name, there was no scope for making a departure from the view. This stand is clearly unsustainable. As has been rightly contended by the learned counsel for the respondent, at the first stage though the Minister had directed inclusion of appellant’s name, subsequently when relevant material was placed before him, he took a view different from what he had taken earlier. As noted above, there was no challenge to the Minister’s order disapproving the case of the appellant. 11. That being so, there is no scope for interference with the orders passed by the Tribunal and the High Court. The appeal is without merit and is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.","JUDGMENT: J U D G M E N T CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5543 OF 2007 (Arising out of SLP (C) No. 10899 of 2005) Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Leave granted. 2.

35,Appeal (civil) 5646 of 1999,"Commissioner of Central Excise, Pune",Abhi Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd.,21/02/2005,"S.N. Variava,Dr. AR. Lakshmanan & S.H. Kapadia","J U D G M E N T Dr. AR. Lakshmanan, J. This civil appeal is directed against the judgment and final order No. 243/99-D in Appeal No. E/2546/93-D dated 11.03.1999 passed by the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (for short ’the CEGAT’) at New Delhi. The respondent is the manufacturer of Dailymix. Four show cause notices were issued alleging that they had mis-classified their products under C.S.H. No. 2302.00 and cleared at nil rate of duty. The show cause notices added that these products are intermixture of vitamins and, therefore, correctly classifiable under C.S.H. No. 2936.00 and as such chargeable to duty at the rate of 15% advance (BED) + 5% BED (SED). The Assistant Commissioner in his order dated 24.01.1991 held that the products Dailymix and Briplex were correctly classifiable under Chapter Sub-heading 2302.00. He, however, confirmed the demand of Rs.2,04,129.18. In respect of ’RECOVIT’with which we are concerned in this appeal, he held that it is classifiable under Chapter Sub-heading 2936.00 as animal feed supplement. The conclusion of the Assistant Commissioner was arrived at on the basis of Dy. Chief Chemist’s report which stated that Recovit may be considered as an organic chemical (intermixture of vitamins) marked as Annexure-P2. The assessee filed an appeal before the Commissioner (Appeals) who, by his order dated 27.07.1993, set aside the order of the Assistant Commissioner and held that Recovit was correctly classifiable under Chapter Sub-heading 2302.00 as animal feed. The revenue filed an appeal against the order of the Commissioner (Appeals) which has been decided by the CEGAT vide its order dated 11.03.1999. The Tribunal has dismissed the appeal of the Department relying upon the decision of a larger Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Tetragon Chemie (P) Ltd. & Ors. Vs. CCE, Bangalore & Ors. reported in 1999 (82) ECR 98 dated 13.11.1998. The Tribunal has further held that the contention of the revenue that Recovit is merely a mixture of vitamins alone is not borne out on facts. The Tribunal held that such a product, however, if it contains other things such as anti-oxidants, solvents, stabilisers and used as animal feed will not be classified under Chapter sub-heading 2936, but will be correctly classified under Tariff heading 23.02. Aggrieved by the order of the Tribunal, the Revenue has come up in appeal. As stated earlier, we are concerned in this appeal in regard to the classification of a product known as Recovit. Now the question is whether animal feed (Recovit) is classifiable under Tariff Heading 29.36 as intermixture of vitamins or under Tariff heading 23.02 as animal feed. We heard Mr. R.Venkataramani, learned senior counsel for the appellant and Mr. Makarand D.Adkar, learned counsel for the respondent.   of 7 Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant invited our attention to the show cause notices issued and the orders passed by all the authorities including the Tribunal and submitted that both the Commissioner (Appeals) and the CEGAT have totally ignored the Dy. Chief Chemist’s report dated 06.12.1990 in respect of Daily mix, Recovit etc. and that Recovit should be treated as animal feed supplement containing vitamins and minerals. He would further submit that both the Commissioner (Appeals) and the CEGAT have erred in placing total reliance on the judgment of Tetragon Chemie (P) Ltd. (supra). According to the learned senior counsel, the product in that case consists of a mixture of vitamins, minerals and various other ingredients which is not similar to the product ’Recovit’ as the same consists of only intermixtures of vitamins and, therefore, it is correctly classifiable under Chapter Sub-heading 2936.00. Before proceeding further in considering the submission made by learned senior counsel for the appellant, it is better to reproduce both the entries. ""Heading Sub- Description of goods Rate of No. heading No. duty (1) (2) (3) (4) 23.01 2301.00 Residues and waste from the food 12% industries, including bagasse, other waste of sugar manufacture and oil cakes 23.02 2302.00 Preparations of a kind used in Nil animal feeding, including dog and cat food XI. PROVITAMINS, VITAMINS AND HORMONES 29.36 2936.00 Provitamins and vitamins, natural or 15% reproduced by synthesis (including natural concentrates), derivatives thereof used primarily as vitamins, and intermixtures of the foregoing, whether or not in any solvent"" The assessee has declared these three products in that classification list which had been approved by the Assistant Collector. They are: a) Daily mix :- \005.. b) Recovit :- It is a mixture of vitamins but it contains stabilisers and anti-oxidants also, in addition to solvents. c) Briplex :- \005.. According to the assessee, the classification list for these products has already been approved by the Assistant Collector and, therefore, the Assistant Collector is not competent to change his own decision. The assessee had claimed the classification of these products under Chapter sub heading 2302 as animal feed supplement and the Department had claimed that the correct classification would be under Chapter sub-heading 2936 as organic chemicals. It is stated that the product is used as animal feed only and is meant for consumption by animals. It is not fit for human consumption. It basically consists of mixture of vitamins, minerals, anti oxidants and stabilisers. The Assistant Collector has wrongly classified the product under Chapter 29 as intermixture of vitamins merely because it consists of solvents, stabilisers and anti-oxidants. It was further stated that once powder is meant for use as an animal feed supplement, it should be classified under Chapter Sub-heading 2302. In our view, the products which have mixture of vitamins and minerals with addition of other ingredients and which are used for animal feed and are not fit for human consumption are to be classified as animal feed supplement under Chapter Heading 2302 and not under Chapter 29. Learned senior counsel for the Department sought to place reliance upon the report of the Dy. Chief Chemist which has been annexed. It has  Page 3 of 7 come on record that the product Recovit basically consists of mixture of vitamins, solvents, anti-oxidants and stabilisers. It has also come on record that Recovit is used as animal feed only and is being consumed by animals only. It is a finding of fact recorded by the Commissioner (Appeals) and also by the Tribunal. It may not be out of place to mention that the composition of product was argued before the Tribunal. However, the Department could not contradict or dislodge the findings recorded by the Commissioner (Appeals). Both the Commissioner (Appeals) and the Tribunal examined the facts of the case and decided the matter in favour of the assessee. Our attention was invited to the reply affidavit filed by the assessee in this appeal. It is seen that a trade notice No. 34/1990 was issued by the Collector of Central Excise and Customs, Pune whereby it was clarified by the Department that the product having vitamins, stabilisers, anti-oxidants and solvents merits classification under Chapter 29 Heading 29.36 and not under Heading 23.02 of the schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. Apparently based on the above trade notice, a show cause notice was issued which led to the present appeal. Trade notice No. 34 of 1990 reads as follows: ""OFFICE OF THE COLLECTOR OF CENTRAL EXCISE & CUSTOMS, PUNE PMC’S COMMERCIAL BUILDING, HIRABAUG, TILAK ROAD, PUNE \026 2. ********** PUNE CENTRAL EXCISE & CUSTOMS, COLLECTORATE TRADE NOTICE NO. 34 / 1990 ( 1/Ch. 23 / 90) Sub :- Central Excise Classification of intermixtures of Vitamins used as animal feed supplements whether classifiable under Heading 23.02 or in Chapter 30 or Chapter 29 \026 regarding. A doubt has been raised regarding the correct classification of products which consists of only different vitamins in definite proportions and no other ingredients except the solvents or stabilisers or anti-oxidants. Such products are generally used as animal feed supplements. The doubt raised is whether the such products which are mixtures of vitamins are classifiable under heading 23.02 or as medicaments under heading 30.03 or an inter mixture of vitamins under heading 29.36. The matter has been examined and it is observed that such animal feed supplements which are just inter mixture of vitamins only and that there are no other ingredients except solvents, stabilisers or anti-oxidants are specifically covered under heading 29.36 of C.E.T. as inter mixture of vitamins. Even though they are used as animal feed supplements, they can be classified under heading 23.02 as preparations of kind used in animal feeding, because this is a general heading. Inter mixture of vitamins are specified in so many words in heading 29.36 and accordingly products of the type referred above are correctly classifiable under heading 29.36. All Trade Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industries are requested to bring the contents of this Trade Notice to the notice of their member constituents. Hindi version is enclosed.

Trade Notice No. 34 of 1990 seems to have been issued on the basis of the Board Circular No. 1 of 1990 dated 01.01.1990. The Central Board of Excise and Customs vide its circular No. 188/22/96-CX dated 26.03.1996 has clarified that when premix contains in addition to active substances, stabilisers, anti-oxidants etc. and if such preparations are of a kind used in animal feeding the same is classifiable under Heading 23.02. The said circular reads as follows:  Page 4 of 7 ""Animal Feed Supplements Circular No. 188/22/96-CX Dated 26/3/96 Government of India Ministry of Finance Department of Revenue Central Board of Excise and Customs, New Delhi Subject: Classification of Animal Feed Supplements under Sub-heading No. 23.02 or 29.36 or Chapter 30 \026 Instructions \026 Regarding. It has been brought to the notice of the Board that a large number of products with supplements’/additives/premixes etc. but are being classified either under heading 23.02 or heading 29.36 or under Chapter 30 of the Central Excise Tariff in various Commissionerates. 2. It would be recalled that in its Circular No.1/90 dated 1.1.1990, issued from F.No.15/20/89-Cx.I, Board had observed that animal feed supplements which are just inter-mixtures of vitamins only without other ingredients, except solvents, stabilizers or anti-oxidants, cannot be classified under heading 23.02 even though they are used as animal feed supplements. Board had observed that such inter-mixtures of vitamins are specifically covered under heading 29.36. 3. Trade interests have however represented that animal feed supplements use vitamins, pro-vitamins, amino-acids, anti-biotics, ’Coccidiostats’ etc. in very small quantities (micro-quantities) and that the feed supplements contain other organic and in organic feed ingredients as well. They have also represented that such micro-nutrients do not have any independent identity as pure chemicals, that they cannot be easily separated into individual pure chemicals: nor do they conform to standard laid down for medicaments. As such, it is claimed that animal feed supplements cannot be classified under Chapter 29 or Chapter 30 of the Central Excise Tariff merely because they contain the said micro-nutrients. 4. The matter has been further examined by the Board in consultation with the Chief Chemist, Central Revenue Chemical Laboratory (CRCL), New Delhi. 5. Heading 23.02 of Central Excise Tariff i.e. ""preparations of a kind used in animal feeding including dog and cat food"" corresponds to Heading 23.09 ""Preparations of a kind used in animal feeding"" of the HSN. As per Explanatory notes under Heading 23.09 of the HSN, the said heading covers complete animal feeds, supplementary animal feeds and preparations for use in making the complete feeds or supplementary feeds. The preparations for use in making complete feeds or supplementary feeds are known in the trade as ""premixes"". These preparations are compound composition consisting of a number of substances \026 each type of these substances being present in the ’premix’ in varying propositions to serve a particular purpose. The explanatory notes under Heading 23.09 of HSN (pp, 177-178) further indicate that pre-mixes contain, in addition to the active substances (vitamins, amino-acid, anti-biotics, coccidiostats etc.) and stabilizers, anti-oxidants etc., certain organic or in-organic nutritive substances known as carriers which help in homogeneous dispersion and mixing of the active substances in the compound feeds to which the preparations referred to in the said explanatory notes are added. 6. In this view of the matter, it would appear that preparations containing the active substances (vitamins or provitamins, amino-acid, antibiotics, coccidiostats etc.) along with the said carriers would fall under Heading 23.02 of the CET provided such preparation are of a kind used in animal feeding. It may however be noted that Heading 23.098 of the HSN excludes products of Chapter 29 and medicaments of Heading 30.03 or 30.04. Hence, while deciding the classification of the products claimed to be animal feed supplements are ordinarily of commonly known to the trade as products for a specific use in animal feeding. 7.

In fact, the said order of the larger bench was challenged before this Court. This Court in Collector of Central Excise, Bangalore vs. Tetragon Chemie P. Ltd. reported in 2001 (132) E.L.T. 525 (Three-Judge Bench) upheld the view taken by the Tribunal that the products in question are animal feed supplements and that the animal feed supplements were rightly included in Tariff Item 23.02 being preparation of a kind used in animal feeding including dogs and cats food. The Bench has agreed with the conclusion of the Tribunal that even food supplements like the products of the respondents therein which are used in animals feeding would fall under Heading 23.02. This Court while affirming the decision of the Tribunal dismissed the civil appeals. For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that the contentions in the civil appeal are apparently contrary to the stand taken by the Department in the circulars mentioned supra and we, therefore, have no hesitation in dismissing the appeal as bereft of any merits. However, we say no costs.","J U D G M E N T Dr. AR. Lakshmanan, J. This civil appeal is directed against the judgment and final order No. 243/99-D in Appeal No. E/2546/93-D dated 11.03.1999 passed by the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (for short ’the CEGAT’) at New Delhi. The respondent is the manufacturer of Dailymix. Four show cause notices were issued alleging that they had mis-classified their products under C.S.H. No. 2302.00 and cleared at nil rate of duty. The show cause notices added that these products are intermixture of vitamins and, therefore, correctly classifiable under C.S.H. No. 2936.00 and as such chargeable to duty at the rate of 15% advance (BED) + 5% BED (SED). The Assistant Commissioner in his order dated 24.01.1991 held that the products Dailymix and Briplex were correctly classifiable under Chapter Sub-heading 2302.00. He, however, confirmed the demand of Rs.2,04,129.18. In respect of ’RECOVIT’with which we are concerned in this appeal, he held that it is classifiable under Chapter Sub-heading 2936.00 as animal feed supplement. The conclusion of the Assistant Commissioner was arrived at on the basis of Dy. Chief Chemist’s report which stated that Recovit may be considered as an organic chemical (intermixture of vitamins) marked as Annexure-P2. The assessee filed an appeal before the Commissioner (Appeals) who, by his order dated 27.07.1993, set aside the order of the Assistant Commissioner and held that Recovit was correctly classifiable under Chapter Sub-heading 2302.00 as animal feed. The revenue filed an appeal against the order of the Commissioner (Appeals) which has been decided by the CEGAT vide its order dated 11.03.1999. The Tribunal has dismissed the appeal of the Department relying upon the decision of a larger Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Tetragon Chemie (P) Ltd. & Ors. Vs. CCE, Bangalore & Ors. reported in 1999 (82) ECR 98 dated 13.11.1998. The Tribunal has further held that the contention of the revenue that Recovit is merely a mixture of vitamins alone is not borne out on facts. The Tribunal held that such a product, however, if it contains other things such as anti-oxidants, solvents, stabilisers and used as animal feed will not be classified under Chapter sub-heading 2936, but will be correctly classified under Tariff heading 23.02. Aggrieved by the order of the Tribunal, the Revenue has come up in appeal. As stated earlier, we are concerned in this appeal in regard to the classification of a product known as Recovit. Now the question is whether animal feed (Recovit) is classifiable under Tariff Heading 29.36 as intermixture of vitamins or under Tariff heading 23.02 as animal feed. We heard Mr. R.Venkataramani, learned senior counsel for the appellant and Mr. Makarand D.Adkar, learned counsel for the respondent.   of 7 Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant invited our attention to the show cause notices issued and the orders passed by all the authorities including the Tribunal and submitted that both the Commissioner (Appeals) and the CEGAT have totally ignored the Dy. Chief Chemist’s report dated 06.12.1990 in respect of Daily mix, Recovit etc. and that Recovit should be treated as animal feed supplement containing vitamins and minerals. He would further submit that both the Commissioner (Appeals) and the CEGAT have erred in placing total reliance on the judgment of Tetragon Chemie (P) Ltd. (supra). According to the learned senior counsel, the product in that case consists of a mixture of vitamins, minerals and various other ingredients which is not similar to the product ’Recovit’ as the same consists of only intermixtures of vitamins and, therefore, it is correctly classifiable under Chapter Sub-heading 2936.00. Before proceeding further in considering the submission made by learned senior counsel for the appellant, it is better to reproduce both the entries. ""Heading Sub- Description of goods Rate of No. heading No. duty (1) (2) (3) (4) 23.01 2301.00 Residues and waste from the food 12% industries, including bagasse, other waste of sugar manufacture and oil cakes 23.02 2302.00 Preparations of a kind used in Nil animal feeding, including dog and cat food XI.

They are: a) Daily mix :- \005.. b) Recovit :- It is a mixture of vitamins but it contains stabilisers and anti-oxidants also, in addition to solvents. c) Briplex :- \005.. According to the assessee, the classification list for these products has already been approved by the Assistant Collector and, therefore, the Assistant Collector is not competent to change his own decision. The assessee had claimed the classification of these products under Chapter sub heading 2302 as animal feed supplement and the Department had claimed that the correct classification would be under Chapter sub-heading 2936 as organic chemicals. It is stated that the product is used as animal feed only and is meant for consumption by animals. It is not fit for human consumption. It basically consists of mixture of vitamins, minerals, anti oxidants and stabilisers. The Assistant Collector has wrongly classified the product under Chapter 29 as intermixture of vitamins merely because it consists of solvents, stabilisers and anti-oxidants. It was further stated that once powder is meant for use as an animal feed supplement, it should be classified under Chapter Sub-heading 2302. In our view, the products which have mixture of vitamins and minerals with addition of other ingredients and which are used for animal feed and are not fit for human consumption are to be classified as animal feed supplement under Chapter Heading 2302 and not under Chapter 29. Learned senior counsel for the Department sought to place reliance upon the report of the Dy. Chief Chemist which has been annexed. It has  Page 3 of 7 come on record that the product Recovit basically consists of mixture of vitamins, solvents, anti-oxidants and stabilisers. It has also come on record that Recovit is used as animal feed only and is being consumed by animals only. It is a finding of fact recorded by the Commissioner (Appeals) and also by the Tribunal. It may not be out of place to mention that the composition of product was argued before the Tribunal. However, the Department could not contradict or dislodge the findings recorded by the Commissioner (Appeals). Both the Commissioner (Appeals) and the Tribunal examined the facts of the case and decided the matter in favour of the assessee. Our attention was invited to the reply affidavit filed by the assessee in this appeal. It is seen that a trade notice No. 34/1990 was issued by the Collector of Central Excise and Customs, Pune whereby it was clarified by the Department that the product having vitamins, stabilisers, anti-oxidants and solvents merits classification under Chapter 29 Heading 29.36 and not under Heading 23.02 of the schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. Apparently based on the above trade notice, a show cause notice was issued which led to the present appeal. Trade notice No. 34 of 1990 reads as follows: ""OFFICE OF THE COLLECTOR OF CENTRAL EXCISE & CUSTOMS, PUNE PMC’S COMMERCIAL BUILDING, HIRABAUG, TILAK ROAD, PUNE \026 2. ********** PUNE CENTRAL EXCISE & CUSTOMS, COLLECTORATE TRADE NOTICE NO. 34 / 1990 ( 1/Ch. 23 / 90) Sub :- Central Excise Classification of intermixtures of Vitamins used as animal feed supplements whether classifiable under Heading 23.02 or in Chapter 30 or Chapter 29 \026 regarding. A doubt has been raised regarding the correct classification of products which consists of only different vitamins in definite proportions and no other ingredients except the solvents or stabilisers or anti-oxidants. Such products are generally used as animal feed supplements. The doubt raised is whether the such products which are mixtures of vitamins are classifiable under heading 23.02 or as medicaments under heading 30.03 or an inter mixture of vitamins under heading 29.36. The matter has been examined and it is observed that such animal feed supplements which are just inter mixture of vitamins only and that there are no other ingredients except solvents, stabilisers or anti-oxidants are specifically covered under heading 29.36 of C.E.T. as inter mixture of vitamins. Even though they are used as animal feed supplements, they can be classified under heading 23.02 as preparations of kind used in animal feeding, because this is a general heading. Inter mixture of vitamins are specified in so many words in heading 29.36 and accordingly products of the type referred above are correctly classifiable under heading 29.36.

Trade Notice No. 34 of 1990 seems to have been issued on the basis of the Board Circular No. 1 of 1990 dated 01.01.1990. The Central Board of Excise and Customs vide its circular No. 188/22/96-CX dated 26.03.1996 has clarified that when premix contains in addition to active substances, stabilisers, anti-oxidants etc. and if such preparations are of a kind used in animal feeding the same is classifiable under Heading 23.02. The said circular reads as follows:  Page 4 of 7 ""Animal Feed Supplements Circular No. 188/22/96-CX Dated 26/3/96 Government of India Ministry of Finance Department of Revenue Central Board of Excise and Customs, New Delhi Subject: Classification of Animal Feed Supplements under Sub-heading No. 23.02 or 29.36 or Chapter 30 \026 Instructions \026 Regarding. It has been brought to the notice of the Board that a large number of products with supplements’/additives/premixes etc. but are being classified either under heading 23.02 or heading 29.36 or under Chapter 30 of the Central Excise Tariff in various Commissionerates. 2. It would be recalled that in its Circular No.1/90 dated 1.1.1990, issued from F.No.15/20/89-Cx.I, Board had observed that animal feed supplements which are just inter-mixtures of vitamins only without other ingredients, except solvents, stabilizers or anti-oxidants, cannot be classified under heading 23.02 even though they are used as animal feed supplements. Board had observed that such inter-mixtures of vitamins are specifically covered under heading 29.36. 3. Trade interests have however represented that animal feed supplements use vitamins, pro-vitamins, amino-acids, anti-biotics, ’Coccidiostats’ etc. in very small quantities (micro-quantities) and that the feed supplements contain other organic and in organic feed ingredients as well. They have also represented that such micro-nutrients do not have any independent identity as pure chemicals, that they cannot be easily separated into individual pure chemicals: nor do they conform to standard laid down for medicaments. As such, it is claimed that animal feed supplements cannot be classified under Chapter 29 or Chapter 30 of the Central Excise Tariff merely because they contain the said micro-nutrients. 4. The matter has been further examined by the Board in consultation with the Chief Chemist, Central Revenue Chemical Laboratory (CRCL), New Delhi. 5. Heading 23.02 of Central Excise Tariff i.e. ""preparations of a kind used in animal feeding including dog and cat food"" corresponds to Heading 23.09 ""Preparations of a kind used in animal feeding"" of the HSN. As per Explanatory notes under Heading 23.09 of the HSN, the said heading covers complete animal feeds, supplementary animal feeds and preparations for use in making the complete feeds or supplementary feeds. The preparations for use in making complete feeds or supplementary feeds are known in the trade as ""premixes"". These preparations are compound composition consisting of a number of substances \026 each type of these substances being present in the ’premix’ in varying propositions to serve a particular purpose. The explanatory notes under Heading 23.09 of HSN (pp, 177-178) further indicate that pre-mixes contain, in addition to the active substances (vitamins, amino-acid, anti-biotics, coccidiostats etc.) and stabilizers, anti-oxidants etc., certain organic or in-organic nutritive substances known as carriers which help in homogeneous dispersion and mixing of the active substances in the compound feeds to which the preparations referred to in the said explanatory notes are added. 6. In this view of the matter, it would appear that preparations containing the active substances (vitamins or provitamins, amino-acid, antibiotics, coccidiostats etc.) along with the said carriers would fall under Heading 23.02 of the CET provided such preparation are of a kind used in animal feeding. It may however be noted that Heading 23.098 of the HSN excludes products of Chapter 29 and medicaments of Heading 30.03 or 30.04. Hence, while deciding the classification of the products claimed to be animal feed supplements are ordinarily of commonly known to the trade as products for a specific use in animal feeding. 7. In view of the foregoing discussions, the classification of each product being claimed as animal feed supplements may be decided on merits in the light of the above and in accordance with the explanatory notes to Heading 23.09 or the HSN read with Chapter Note 1 of Chapter 23 of the CET.

Pursuant to this agreement the said Sitaram Luxman erected those plots a building which has since come to be known as the New Sitaram Building. the completion of the building, by an Indenture -of lease made April 19, 1916, between, the Trustees for the Improvement of the City of Bombay and one Rustomji Dhunjibhoy Sethna the receiver of the estate of Sitaram Luxman appointed by the High Court in Suit No. 720 of 1913, the Trustees, pursuant to the said agreement and in consideration of the monies which had been expended in the erection of the buildings and of the rent and the covenants thereinafter reserved and contained, demised unto the lessee all that piece of land situate their Princess Street estate together with the buildings erected thereon to hold the same for 999 years from April 15, 1908, paying therefor up to January, 15, 1909, the rent of Re. I and during the remainder of 188 the term the yearly rent of Rs. 2,916 by equal quarterly payments. By the said Indenture the lessee covenanted to pay all rates and taxes, not to use or to permit to be used, without the lessor’s consent, the portion of land not built upon except as open space, not to pull down, add to or alter the buildings without such consent, to keep in repair all drains sewers etc., to repair, pave, cleanse and paint and amend all the buildings, walls etc., to permit the lessors and their employees to enter upon the premises to inspect the conditions thereof 48 hours’ notice, to use the demised premises for residential purposes or as offices and schools only and not as a public house or liquor shop or for any business or trade, throughout the term to keep the buildings insured against fire in the joint names of the lessor and the lessee and to rebuild or reinstate and repair the building if destroyed or damaged by fire or otherwise. There was a proviso for re-entry for nonpayment of rent for 30 days or for breach of any of the lessee’s covenants. In 1925 all the properties of the Trustees for the Improvement of the City of Bombay vested in the Bombay Municipality under and by virtue of Bombay Act XVI of 1925. By a deed of assignment made April 26, 1948, Shri Bhatia Co-operative Housing Society Limited, a society registered under the Bombay Co-operative Societies Act, VII of 1921, the appellant before us, acquired the lessee’s interest in the demised premises. June 29, 1948, the appellant served a notice the respondent before us who was a monthly tenant in occupation of Block No. B/2 the ground floor of the New Sitaram Building at a monthly rental of Rs. 52-5-9 to quit and vacate the same July 31, 1948. By his advocate’s reply the respondent maintained that he had been paying the rent regularly and otherwise performing the terms of his tenancy and claimed the protection of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 (Act LVII of 1947); 189 The respondent not having vacated the block under his occupation the expiry of the notice to quit, the appellant filed summary Suit No. 106 of 1948 against the respondent in the City Civil Court at Bombay for vacant possession of the said Block No. B/2 the ground floor of the said New  Page 4 of 8 Sitaram Buildings and mesne profits from August 1, 1948, until delivery of possession. After stating the material facts, the appellant submitted that the Bombay Act LVII of 1947 did not apply to the demised premises. The respondent filed his written statement maintaining that under section 28 of the Bombay Act the CityCivil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. He averred that he had performed and observed all the conditions of his tenancy and was ready and willing to do so, that the New Sitaram Building had been constructed at the expense of the appellant’s predecessor in title and that the premises belonged to the appellant and not to the Government or a local authority and that the respondent was entitled to the protection of the Bombay Act LVII of 1947. Leaving out the issue as to whether the appellant was entitled to any compensation, there were 4 issues raising in effect two points, namely, (1) whether the Court had jurisdiction and (2) whether the Bombay Act LVII of 1947 applied to the premises in suit. The learned City Civil Court Judge in a well-considered and careful judgment answered the issues in favour of the appellant and decreed the suit. The respondent appealed to the High Court. The High Court reversed the decision of the trial Judge and holding that the Bombay Act LVII of 1947 did apply to the premises and consequently that the City Civil Court, by virtue of section 28 of that Act, had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit, directed that the plaint, be returned to the appellant for being filed in the proper Court. The High Court having declined to grant leave to the appellant to appeal to this Court, the appellant applied for and obtained special leave 190 of this Court to prefer this appeal and filed this appeal pursuant to such leave. Learned counsel for the respondent took a preli minary objection, founded the provisions of section 28 of the Bombay Act, that the City Civil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit, for that section clearly states that in Greater Bombay the Court of Small Causes alone shall have jurisdiction to entertain and try any suit between a landlord and a tenant relating to the recovery of rent or possession of any premises to which any of the provisions of that Part of the Act applied and to decide any application made under the Act and to deal with any claim or question arising out of the Act and no other Court should have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding or to deal with such claim or question. If, as contended for by the appellant, the Act does not apply to the premises, then section 28 which is an integral part of the Act and takes away the jurisdiction of all Courts other than the Small Causes Court in Greater Bombay cannot obviously be invoked by the respondent. The crucial point, therefore, in order to determine the question of the jurisdiction of the City Civil Court to entertain the suit, is to ascertain whether, in view of section 4 of the Act, the Act applies to the premises at all. If it does, the City Civil Court has no jurisdiction but if it does not, then it has such jurisdiction. The question at once arises as to who is to decide this point in controversy. It is well settled that a Civil Court has inherent power to decide the question of its own jurisdiction, although, as a result of its enquiry, it may turn out that it has no jurisdiction over the suit. Accordingly we think, in agreement with the High Court, that this preliminary objection is not well founded in principle or authority and should be rejected. The main controversy between the parties is as to  Page 5 of 8 whether the Act applies to the demised premises. The solution of that controversy depends upon a true construction of section 4 (1) of the Bombay Act LVII of 1947, Which runs as follows: 191 ""4. (1) This Act shall not apply to any promises belonging to the Government or a local authority or apply as against the Government to any tenancy or other like relationship created by a grant from the$ Government in respect of premises,taken lease or requisitioned by the Government; but it shall apply in respect of premises let to the Government or a local authority."" It is clear that the above sub-section has three parts, namely (1) This Act shall not apply to premises belonging to the Government or a local authority, (2) This Act shall not apply as against the Government to any tenancy or other like relationship created by grant from the Government in respect of premises taken lease or requisitioned by the Government, (3) This Act shall apply in respect of premises lot out to the Government or a local authority. The contention of the appellant Society is that the demised premises belonged to the Trustees for the improvement of the City of Bombay and now belong to the Bombay Municipality both of which bodies are local authorities and, therefore, the Act does not apply to the demised premises. Learned counsel for the respondent, however, urges that the object of the Act, as recited in the preamble, is inter alia, to control rent. It follows, therefore, that the object of the legislation was that the provisions of the Act would be applicable only as between the landlord and tenant. Section 4 (1) provides for an exemption from or exception to that general object. The purpose of the; first two parts of section 4 (1) is to exempt two cases of relationship of landlord and tenant from the operation of the Act, namely, (1) where the Government or a local authority lets out premises belonging to it, and (2) where the Government lets out premises taken on lease or requisitioned by it. It will be observed that the second part of section 4 (1) quite clearly exempts ""any tenancy or other like relationship"" created by the Government but the first part makes no 192 reference to Any tenancy or other like relationship at all but exempts the premises belonging to the Government or a local authority. If the intention of the first -#part were as formulated in item (1), then the first part of section 4 (1), like the second part, would have run thus: This Act shall not apply to any tenancy or other like relationship created by Government or local authority in respect of premises belonging to it. The Legislature was familiar with this form of expression, for it adopted it in the second part and yet it did not use that form in the first. The conclusion is, therefore, irresistible that the Legislature did not by the first part intend to exempt the relationship of landlord and tenant but intended to confer the premises belonging to Government an immunity from the operation of the Act. Learned counsel for the respondent next contends that the immunity given by the first part should be held to be available only to the Government or a local authority to which the premises belong. If that were the intention then the Legislature would have used phraseology similar to what it did in the second part, namely, it would have expressly made the Act inapplicable ""as against the  Page 6 of 8 Government or a local authority"". This it did not do and the only inference that can be drawn from this circumstance is that this departure was made deliberately with a view to exempt the premises itself. It is said that if the first part of the section is so construed as to exempt the premises from the operation of the Act, not only as between the Government or a local authority the one hand and its lessee the other, but also as between that lessee and his subtenant, then the whole purpose of the Act will be frustrated, for it is well known that most of the lands in Greater Bombay belong to the Government or one or other local authority, e.g., Bombay Port Trust and Bombay Municipality and the greater number of tenants will not be able to avail themselves of the benefit and protection of the Act. In the first place, the 193 preamble to the Act clearly shows that the object of the Act was to consolidate the law relating to the control of rents and repairs of certain premises and not of all premises. The Legislature may well have thought that an immunity given to premises belonging to the Government or a local authority will facilitate the speedy development of its lands by inducing lessees to take up building leases terms advantageous to the Government or a local authority. Further, as pointed out by Romer L. J. in Clark v. Downes(1), which case was approved by Lord Goddard C.J. in Rudler v. Franks(1) such immunity will increase the value of the right of reversion belonging to the Government or a local authority. The fact that the Government or a local authority may be trusted to act fairly and reasonably may have induced the Legislature all the more readily to give such immunity to premises belonging to the Government or a local authority but it cannot be overlooked that the primary object of giving this immunity was to protect the interests of the Government or a local authority. This protection requires that the immunity should be held to attach to the premises itself and the benefit of it should be available not only to the Government or a local authority but also to the lessee deriving title from it. If the benefit of the immunity was given only to the Government or a local authority and not to its lessee as suggested by learned counsel for the respondent and the Act applied to the premises as against the lessee, then it must follow that under section 15 of the Act it will not be lawful for the lessee to sublet the premises or any part of it. If such were the consequences, nobody will take a building lease from the Government or a local authority -and the immunity given to the Government or a local authority will, for all practical purposes and in so far at any rate as the building leases are concerned, be wholly illusory and worthless and the underlying purpose for bestowing such immunity will be rendered wholly ineffective. In our opinion, therefore, the consideration of the (I) [1931] 145 L.T. 20. (2) [1947] 1 K.B. 530. 194 protection of the interests of the sub-tenants in premises belonging to the Government or a local authority cannot override the plain meaning of the preamble or the first part of section 4 (1) and frustrate the real purpose of protecting and furthering the interests of the Government or a local authority by conf erring its property an immunity from the operation of the Act. Finally, learned counsel for the respondent urges that the words ""belonging to"" have not been used in a technical sense  Page 7 of 8 and should be read in their popular sense. It is pointed out that it was the lessee who erected the building at his own cost, he is to hold it for 999 years, he has the right of subletting the building in whole or in part rent and terms to be fixed by him, of ejecting sub-tenants, and of assigning the lease. Therefore, it may fairly be said that the premises or, at any rate, the building belongs to the lessee and the rights reserved by the lease to the lessor are only by way of security for the preservation of the building which, the expiry or sooner determination of the lease, will vest in the lessor. This line -of reasoning has found favour with the High Court which has held that although in form the building belongs to the Bombay Municipality who are the successors in interest of the lessors, in substance the building belongs to the appellant, the assignee of the lessee, and not to the Bombay Municipality. We are unable to accept this reasoning, for we see no reason to hold, in the circumstances of this case, that the substance does not follow the form. By the opera tive part of the lease the demise is not only of the land but also of the building standing thereon. This demise is ’certainly an act of ownership exercised by the lessor over the land as well as the buildings. Under section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act a lease is a transfer only of a right to enjoy the demised, premises, but there is no transfer of ownership or interest in the demised promises to the lessee such as there is in a sale (section 54) or a mortgage (section 58). In the present case, the lessee cannot, his 195 own covenant, use the buildings in any way he likes. He has to use the game only as offices or schools or for residential purposes and cannot, without the lessor’s consent, use them for purposes of any trade or, business. He cannot pull down the buildings or make any additions or alterations without the lessor’s consent. He cannot build upon the open space. He must, if the premises are destroyed by fire or otherwise, reinstate it. The lessor has the right to enter upon and inspect the premises at any time giving 48 hours’ notice. All these covenants clearly indicate that the lessor ha$ the dominant voice and the real ownership. What are called attributes of ownership of the lessee are only the rights of enjoyment which are common to all lessees under well drawn leases, but the ownership, in the land and in the building is in the lessor. It is true that the lessee erected the building a this own cost but he did so for the lessor and the lessor’s land agreed terms. The fact that the lessee incurred expenses in putting up the building is precisely the consideration for the lessor granting him a lease for 999 years not only of the building but of the land as well at what may, for all we know, be a cheap rent which the lessor may not have otherwise agreed to do. By the agreement the building became the property of the lessor and the lessor demised the land and the building which, in the circumstances, in law and in fact belonged to the lessor. The law of fixtures under section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act may be different from the English law, but section 108 is subject to any agreement that the parties may choose to make. Here, by the agreement the building became part of the land and the property of the lessor and the lessee took a lease that footing. The lessee or a person claiming title through him cannot now be heard to say that the building does not belong to the lessor. Forfeiture does not, for the first time, give title to the lessor. forfeiture he re-enters  Page 8 of 8 upon what has all along been his own property. Said Lord Macnaghten in Heritable Reversionary Company v. Mullar(1):- (I) (1892] A.C. 598 at 021, 196 ""The words ’Property’ and ’belonging to’ are not technical words in the law of Scotland. They are to be understood, I think, in their ordinary signification. They are infact convertible terms; you can hardly explain the one except by using the other. A man’s property is that which is his own, that which belongs to him. What belongs to him is his pro perty."" In our opinion the interest of the lessor in the demised premises cannot possibly be -described as a contingent interest which will become vested the expiry or sooner determination of the lease, for then the lessor could not have demised the premises including the building as he did or before the determination, of the lease exercise any act of ownership or any control over it as he obviously has the right to do under the covenants referred to above. The truth is that the lessor, after the building was erected, became the owner of it and all the time thereafter the demised premises which include the building have belonged to him subject to the right of enjoyment of the lessee in terms of the lease. If it were to be held that the building belonged to the lessee by reason of his having put it up at his own cost and by reason of the attributes of ownership relied by learned counsel, then as between the local authority (the lessor) and the lessee also the building must for the same reason founded what,have been called the attributes of ownership be held to belong to the lessee and the Act will apply. Surely that could not possibly be the case, for it would mean that the Government or a local authority will always be bound by the Act in respect of the building put up by the lessee under building leases granted by it in respect of land belonging to it. In that case the immunity given to the Government or a local authority will be wholly illusory and worthless. In’ our view in the case before us the demised premises including the building belong to a local authority and are outside the operation of the Act. This Act being out of the way, the appellants were well within their 197 rights to file the suit in ejectment in the City Civil Court and that Court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit and to pass the decree that it did. I The result, therefore, is that we allow this appeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and restore the decree passed by the City Civil Court. The appellant will be entitled to costs throughout in all Courts. Appeal allowed. Agent for the appellant: P. G. Gokhale. Agent for the respondent: S. P.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS J.-This is an appeal filed with the special leave of this Court. It is directed against the judgment and decree passed December 2, 1949, by a Division Bench (Weston and Shah JJ.) of the Bombay High Court reversing, the ground of absence of jurisdiction, the judgment and decree for possession passed January 24, 1949, by the Bombay City Civil Court and directing the return of the plaint for presentation to the proper Court. There is no dispute as to the facts material for the purposes of this appeal. or about April 15, 1908, the Board of Trustees for the Improvement of the City of Bombay put up to auction plots Nos. 16, 17 and 18 of new survey Nos. 8234, 8235 and 8244 situate the Princess Street Estate of the Board containing an area of 2235 square yards for being let certain conditions. One Sitaram Luxman was the highest bidder and was declared the tenant at an annual rent per square yard to be calculated at the rate of 41/2 per cent of Rs. 29 per square yard and he signed the memorandum of agreement incorporating the conditions upon which the auction was held and by which he agreed to be bound. He deposited the moneys in terms of clause 3 of the conditions, and upon such payment entered into possession of the plots. By clause 7 Sitaram Luxman agreed, within the time specified therein, to build and complete at a cost of not less than Rs. 50,000 a building consisting of 5 floors with suitable offices, drains etc. according to plans and specifications to be made by an approved architect and approvedby the Board By clause 17 187 he agreed, so soon as the main building should be roofed in, to insure in the joint names of the Board and of himself and, until the granting of the lease thereinafter provided, keep insured the buildings and works the plots for the full value thereof. Clause 18 of the conditions was as follows: ""18. The lease. Immediately after the completion within the time limited by condition 7 of the said buildings and works to the satisfaction of the Trust Engineer testified by his certificate the Trustees will if the contract has not previously been determined grant to the tenant or his approved nominee who shall accept the same a lease of the said plot with buildings thereon for the term of 999 years  Page 3 of 8 from the date of the auction at the yearly rent calculated in accordance with the accepted bidding for the plot."" Clause 25 gave power to the Board, if the buildings were not completely finished within the stipulated time and certain other contingencies, to forfeit the deposit and to enter upon and retain possession of the plots and all buildings and works then standing thereon. Pursuant to this agreement the said Sitaram Luxman erected those plots a building which has since come to be known as the New Sitaram Building. the completion of the building, by an Indenture -of lease made April 19, 1916, between, the Trustees for the Improvement of the City of Bombay and one Rustomji Dhunjibhoy Sethna the receiver of the estate of Sitaram Luxman appointed by the High Court in Suit No. 720 of 1913, the Trustees, pursuant to the said agreement and in consideration of the monies which had been expended in the erection of the buildings and of the rent and the covenants thereinafter reserved and contained, demised unto the lessee all that piece of land situate their Princess Street estate together with the buildings erected thereon to hold the same for 999 years from April 15, 1908, paying therefor up to January, 15, 1909, the rent of Re. I and during the remainder of 188 the term the yearly rent of Rs. 2,916 by equal quarterly payments. By the said Indenture the lessee covenanted to pay all rates and taxes, not to use or to permit to be used, without the lessor’s consent, the portion of land not built upon except as open space, not to pull down, add to or alter the buildings without such consent, to keep in repair all drains sewers etc., to repair, pave, cleanse and paint and amend all the buildings, walls etc., to permit the lessors and their employees to enter upon the premises to inspect the conditions thereof 48 hours’ notice, to use the demised premises for residential purposes or as offices and schools only and not as a public house or liquor shop or for any business or trade, throughout the term to keep the buildings insured against fire in the joint names of the lessor and the lessee and to rebuild or reinstate and repair the building if destroyed or damaged by fire or otherwise. There was a proviso for re-entry for nonpayment of rent for 30 days or for breach of any of the lessee’s covenants. In 1925 all the properties of the Trustees for the Improvement of the City of Bombay vested in the Bombay Municipality under and by virtue of Bombay Act XVI of 1925. By a deed of assignment made April 26, 1948, Shri Bhatia Co-operative Housing Society Limited, a society registered under the Bombay Co-operative Societies Act, VII of 1921, the appellant before us, acquired the lessee’s interest in the demised premises. June 29, 1948, the appellant served a notice the respondent before us who was a monthly tenant in occupation of Block No. B/2 the ground floor of the New Sitaram Building at a monthly rental of Rs. 52-5-9 to quit and vacate the same July 31, 1948. By his advocate’s reply the respondent maintained that he had been paying the rent regularly and otherwise performing the terms of his tenancy and claimed the protection of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 (Act LVII of 1947); 189 The respondent not having vacated the block under his occupation the expiry of the notice to quit, the appellant filed summary Suit No. 106 of 1948 against the respondent in the City Civil Court at Bombay for vacant possession of the said Block No. B/2 the ground floor of the said New  Page 4 of 8 Sitaram Buildings and mesne profits from August 1, 1948, until delivery of possession. After stating the material facts, the appellant submitted that the Bombay Act LVII of 1947 did not apply to the demised premises. The respondent filed his written statement maintaining that under section 28 of the Bombay Act the CityCivil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit.

Leaving out the issue as to whether the appellant was entitled to any compensation, there were 4 issues raising in effect two points, namely, (1) whether the Court had jurisdiction and (2) whether the Bombay Act LVII of 1947 applied to the premises in suit. The learned City Civil Court Judge in a well-considered and careful judgment answered the issues in favour of the appellant and decreed the suit. The respondent appealed to the High Court. The High Court reversed the decision of the trial Judge and holding that the Bombay Act LVII of 1947 did apply to the premises and consequently that the City Civil Court, by virtue of section 28 of that Act, had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit, directed that the plaint, be returned to the appellant for being filed in the proper Court. The High Court having declined to grant leave to the appellant to appeal to this Court, the appellant applied for and obtained special leave 190 of this Court to prefer this appeal and filed this appeal pursuant to such leave. Learned counsel for the respondent took a preli minary objection, founded the provisions of section 28 of the Bombay Act, that the City Civil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit, for that section clearly states that in Greater Bombay the Court of Small Causes alone shall have jurisdiction to entertain and try any suit between a landlord and a tenant relating to the recovery of rent or possession of any premises to which any of the provisions of that Part of the Act applied and to decide any application made under the Act and to deal with any claim or question arising out of the Act and no other Court should have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding or to deal with such claim or question. If, as contended for by the appellant, the Act does not apply to the premises, then section 28 which is an integral part of the Act and takes away the jurisdiction of all Courts other than the Small Causes Court in Greater Bombay cannot obviously be invoked by the respondent. The crucial point, therefore, in order to determine the question of the jurisdiction of the City Civil Court to entertain the suit, is to ascertain whether, in view of section 4 of the Act, the Act applies to the premises at all. If it does, the City Civil Court has no jurisdiction but if it does not, then it has such jurisdiction. The question at once arises as to who is to decide this point in controversy.

Accordingly we think, in agreement with the High Court, that this preliminary objection is not well founded in principle or authority and should be rejected. The main controversy between the parties is as to  Page 5 of 8 whether the Act applies to the demised premises. The solution of that controversy depends upon a true construction of section 4 (1) of the Bombay Act LVII of 1947, Which runs as follows: 191 ""4. (1) This Act shall not apply to any promises belonging to the Government or a local authority or apply as against the Government to any tenancy or other like relationship created by a grant from the$ Government in respect of premises,taken lease or requisitioned by the Government; but it shall apply in respect of premises let to the Government or a local authority.""

If the benefit of the immunity was given only to the Government or a local authority and not to its lessee as suggested by learned counsel for the respondent and the Act applied to the premises as against the lessee, then it must follow that under section 15 of the Act it will not be lawful for the lessee to sublet the premises or any part of it. If such were the consequences, nobody will take a building lease from the Government or a local authority -and the immunity given to the Government or a local authority will, for all practical purposes and in so far at any rate as the building leases are concerned, be wholly illusory and worthless and the underlying purpose for bestowing such immunity will be rendered wholly ineffective. In our opinion, therefore, the consideration of the (I) [1931] 145 L.T. 20. (2) [1947] 1 K.B. 530. 194 protection of the interests of the sub-tenants in premises belonging to the Government or a local authority cannot override the plain meaning of the preamble or the first part of section 4 (1) and frustrate the real purpose of protecting and furthering the interests of the Government or a local authority by conf erring its property an immunity from the operation of the Act. Finally, learned counsel for the respondent urges that the words ""belonging to"" have not been used in a technical sense  Page 7 of 8 and should be read in their popular sense. It is pointed out that it was the lessee who erected the building at his own cost, he is to hold it for 999 years, he has the right of subletting the building in whole or in part rent and terms to be fixed by him, of ejecting sub-tenants, and of assigning the lease. Therefore, it may fairly be said that the premises or, at any rate, the building belongs to the lessee and the rights reserved by the lease to the lessor are only by way of security for the preservation of the building which, the expiry or sooner determination of the lease, will vest in the lessor. This line -of reasoning has found favour with the High Court which has held that although in form the building belongs to the Bombay Municipality who are the successors in interest of the lessors, in substance the building belongs to the appellant, the assignee of the lessee, and not to the Bombay Municipality. We are unable to accept this reasoning, for we see no reason to hold, in the circumstances of this case, that the substance does not follow the form. By the opera tive part of the lease the demise is not only of the land but also of the building standing thereon. This demise is ’certainly an act of ownership exercised by the lessor over the land as well as the buildings. Under section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act a lease is a transfer only of a right to enjoy the demised, premises, but there is no transfer of ownership or interest in the demised promises to the lessee such as there is in a sale (section 54) or a mortgage (section 58). In the present case, the lessee cannot, his 195 own covenant, use the buildings in any way he likes. He has to use the game only as offices or schools or for residential purposes and cannot, without the lessor’s consent, use them for purposes of any trade or, business. He cannot pull down the buildings or make any additions or alterations without the lessor’s consent. He cannot build upon the open space. He must, if the premises are destroyed by fire or otherwise, reinstate it. The lessor has the right to enter upon and inspect the premises at any time giving 48 hours’ notice. All these covenants clearly indicate that the lessor ha$ the dominant voice and the real ownership. What are called attributes of ownership of the lessee are only the rights of enjoyment which are common to all lessees under well drawn leases, but the ownership, in the land and in the building is in the lessor. It is true that the lessee erected the building a this own cost but he did so for the lessor and the lessor’s land agreed terms. The fact that the lessee incurred expenses in putting up the building is precisely the consideration for the lessor granting him a lease for 999 years not only of the building but of the land as well at what may, for all we know, be a cheap rent which the lessor may not have otherwise agreed to do. By the agreement the building became the property of the lessor and the lessor demised the land and the building which, in the circumstances, in law and in fact belonged to the lessor. The law of fixtures under section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act may be different from the English law, but section 108 is subject to any agreement that the parties may choose to make. Here, by the agreement the building became part of the land and the property of the lessor and the lessee took a lease that footing. The lessee or a person claiming title through him cannot now be heard to say that the building does not belong to the lessor. Forfeiture does not, for the first time, give title to the lessor. forfeiture he re-enters  Page 8 of 8 upon what has all along been his own property. Said Lord Macnaghten in Heritable Reversionary Company v. Mullar(1):- (I) (1892] A.C. 598 at 021, 196 ""The words ’Property’ and ’belonging to’ are not technical words in the law of Scotland. They are to be understood, I think, in their ordinary signification. They are infact convertible terms; you can hardly explain the one except by using the other. A man’s property is that which is his own, that which belongs to him. What belongs to him is his pro perty."" In our opinion the interest of the lessor in the demised premises cannot possibly be -described as a contingent interest which will become vested the expiry or sooner determination of the lease, for then the lessor could not have demised the premises including the building as he did or before the determination, of the lease exercise any act of ownership or any control over it as he obviously has the right to do under the covenants referred to above. The truth is that the lessor, after the building was erected, became the owner of it and all the time thereafter the demised premises which include the building have belonged to him subject to the right of enjoyment of the lessee in terms of the lease. If it were to be held that the building belonged to the lessee by reason of his having put it up at his own cost and by reason of the attributes of ownership relied by learned counsel, then as between the local authority (the lessor) and the lessee also the building must for the same reason founded what,have been called the attributes of ownership be held to belong to the lessee and the Act will apply. Surely that could not possibly be the case, for it would mean that the Government or a local authority will always be bound by the Act in respect of the building put up by the lessee under building leases granted by it in respect of land belonging to it. In that case the immunity given to the Government or a local authority will be wholly illusory and worthless. In’ our view in the case before us the demised premises including the building belong to a local authority and are outside the operation of the Act. This Act being out of the way, the appellants were well within their 197 rights to file the suit in ejectment in the City Civil Court and that Court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit and to pass the decree that it did. I The result, therefore, is that we allow this appeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and restore the decree passed by the City Civil Court. The appellant will be entitled to costs throughout in all Courts. Appeal allowed. Agent for the appellant: P. G. Gokhale. Agent for the respondent: S. P. Varma"

I Appeal under Article 134 (1) (C) of the Constitution of India from the judgment and order dated March 11, 1955, of the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench) at Lucknow in Criminal Revision No. 60 of 1954 arising out of the judgment and order dated February 21, 1954, of the Sessions Judge at Gonda in Criminal Appeal No. 292 of 1953. G.C. Mathur and C. P. Lal, for the appellant. 1957. March 26. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by IMAM J.-This is an appeal by the State of Uttar Pradesh against the decision of the Allahabad High Court on a   of 4 certificate granted by that Court that the case was a fit one for appeal to this Court, 771 The undisputed facts are that one Mohammad Yasin was prosecuted under s. 379, Indian Penal Code. He was released on bail. The respondent along with one Ram Narain stood surety for him, having executed surety bonds under s. 499 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, undertaking to produce the accused Yasin before the Court to answer the charge and to forfeit Rs. 500 each to King Emperor Qaisar-e-Hind as a, penalty if they failed to do so. Yasin absconded; All attempts to secure his presence before the Court were of no avail. Consequently notices were issued under S. 514 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the sureties to show cause why their bonds should not be-forfeited. The Magistrate’ after giving the matter his consideration, ordered their bonds to be forfeited to the extent of Rs. 300 each. The respondent appealed to the Sessions Judge of Gonda who dismissed his appeal. Dissatisfied with the orders of the Magistrate and the Sessions Judge, -the respondent filed a criminal revision in the High I Court and Mulla J. allowed his application and set aside the order of the Magistrate forfeiting the bond executed by him. At the request of the Government Advocate the learned Judge granted the requisite certificate by virtue of which the present appeal is before us. The only question for consideration is whether the bond executed by the respondent was one under the Code of Criminal Procedure and therefore capable of being forfeited in accordance with the provisions of s. 514, Criminal Procedure Code. Section 499 of the Code, requires that before any person is released on bail or released on his own bond, a bond for such sum of money as the police officer or Court, as the case may be, thinks sufficient shall be executed by such person, and, when he is released on bail, by one or more sufficient sureties conditioned that such person shall attend at the time and place mentioned in the bond, and shall continue so: to attend until otherwise directed by the police officer or Court, as the case may be. In Schedule V of the Code of Criminal Procedure various forms are set out and a. 555 of the Code provides that ,subject to the power conferred by s. 554 and by 772 Art. 227 of the Constitution, the forms set forth in that Schedule, with such variation as the circumstances of each case require, may be used for the respective purposes therein mentioned, and if used shall be sufficient. Form XLII of that Schedule sets forth the contents of a bond to be executed by an accused and his surety. The bond is in two parts-one part to be signed by the accused and the other part to be signed by his surety or sureties. Both the accused and the sureties in executing such a bond guarantee the attendance of the accused in Court whenever called upon to answer the charge against him and in case of default also bind themselves to forfeit to Government the specified sum of money mentioned therein. This is what the bond should state since the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, dated January 26, 1950. ’Previous to that Order the word Government did not appear in the bond. By virtue of cl. 4 of the said Order, whenever an expression mentioned in column 1 of the Table thereunder occurred (otherwise than in a title or preamble or in a citation or description of an enactment) in an existing Central or Provincial Law whether an Act, Ordinance or Regulation mentioned in the Schedules to the Order, then unless that expression was by the Order  Page 3 of 4 expressly directed to be otherwise adapted or modified, or to stand unmodified, or to be omitted, there shall be substituted therefor the expression set opposite to it in column, 2 of the said Table. In column 1 of the Table the words "" Crown "" "" Her Majesty "" and "" His Majesty "" appear and against them in column 2 the word ’Government"" appears. The plain reading of this clause is that wherever the words "" Crown "", ""Her Majesty "" or "" His Majesty "" appear, for them, the word "" Government "" shall be substituted in the existing Central or Provincial Laws mentioned in the First Schedule to -the Order. The Code of Criminal Procedure is one of the Central Laws mentioned-in the said Schedule wherein Schedule V of the Code of Criminal Procedure is mentioned and the Order directs that throughout Schedule V of the Criminal Procedure Code, except where otherwise provided, for the words "" Her Majesty The Queen 773 and ""His Majesty The King"" the word ""Government"" shall be substituted. Previous to the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, there was the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1948 and the words ""Empress of India"" appearing in the bond were repealed and in place thereof the, words "" Her Majesty the Queen "" were substituted. India attained Dominion status in 1947 and became a Republic in 1950. The Adaptation of Laws Order, 1948 and that of 1950 were consequential upon the change of status of India into a Dominion and then into a Sovereign Republic. Since January 26, 1950, therefore, no bond executed in favour of the Empress of India could be said to be a bond executed under the Code of Criminal Procedure. The bond which the respondent had executed was to forfeit to the King Emperor a certain sum of money if he made default in procuring the attendance of the accused before the court. He did not execute a bond by which he bound himself to forfeit the said sum either to the Government of the Union of India or that of the State of Uttar Pradesh. The bond executed: by him in 1953 was a bond unknown to the law of the Republic of India under the Code of Criminal Procedure at the time of its execution. Section 514 of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers a court to forfeit a bond which has been executed under the provisions of that Code and since the bond executed by the respondent is not one under the Code of Criminal Procedure, resort could not be had to the provisions of s. 514 of the Code to forfeit the same. It was, however, urged on behalf of the State that under cl. 4 of the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, the form of the bond stood amended by the substitution of the word ""Government"" therein in place and stead of the words ""Her Majesty The Queen"" and the bond should be read accordingly. The words King Emperor Qaisar-e-Hind must be deemed as no longer existing in the forfeited bond. Clause 4 of the Order, however, directs that the word ""Government"" shall be substituted for the words "" Crown "", "" Her Majesty "" and "" His Majesty "". There is no mention therein of the words King Emperor or Emperor of India, Queen Empress or Empress of-India or Qaisar-e-Hind as being so 774 substituted. The words King Emperor Qaisar-e-Hind in the bond executed by the respondent cannot therefore be read, by virtue of cl. 4 of the Order, to mean Government. There has undoubtedly been some error, carelessness or negligence on the part of those on whom a duty lay to make the necessary changes in the phraseology of the bond set out in Schedule V of the Code of Criminal Procedure to be executed under s. 499. The fact, however, remains that the respondent had not  Page 4 of 4 bound himself either to the Government of the Union of India or that of the State of Uttar Pradesh to have his bond forfeited on his failure to produce the accused before the court and he is entitled to say that no order of forfeiture could be passed against him with respect to a bond which was not one under the Code and which was one unknown to the law, as contained in the Code, at the, time of its execution. The objection raised by the respondent to the order forfeiting the bond executed by him is a substantial one and the said order was made under a, misapprehension that it could be made under s. 514 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. Appeal dismissed. 77","JUDGMENT: CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 130 of 1955.

GOVINDA KAPUR, J.L.","JUDGMENT: CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: criminal Appeal No. 184 of 1956. Appeal.. from the judgment and order dated October 15, 1956, of the former Nagpur High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 205 of 1956 and Criminal Reference No. 15 of 1956, arising out of the judgment and order dated July 10, 1956, of the First Additional District Judge, Nagpur in Sessions Trial No. 34 of 1956. 554 J. N. Banerjee and P. C. Agarwala, for the appellant. Jindra Lal and R.H.Dhebdr, for the respondent. 1957. September 25. The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by SINHA J.-This appeal on a certificate of fitness under Art. 134(1)(c), granted by the High Court at Nagpur (as it then was), is directed against the concurrent judgment and orders of the courts below, so far as the appellant Khushal is concerned, convicting and sentencing him to death under s. 302, Indian Penal Code, for the pre-meditated murder of Baboolal on the night of February 12, 1956, in one of the quarters of the city of Nagpur. It appears that there are two rival factions in what has been called the Mill area in Nagpur. The appellant and Tukaram who has been acquitted by the High Court, are the leaders of one of the factions, and Ramgopal, P.W. 4, Inaya tullah, P.W. 1, and Tantu, P.W. 5, are said to be the lead ers of the opposite faction. Before the time and date of the occurrence, there had been a number of incidents between the two rival factions in respect of some of which Inayatul lah and Tantu aforesaid had been prosecuted. Even on the date of the occurrence, apart from the one leading to the murder of Baboolal, which is the subject-matter of the present appeal, Tantu and Inayatullah had made two separate reports about the attacks on them by Khushal’s party. There was another report lodged by Sampat-one of the four persons placed on trial along with the appellant, for the murder of Baboolal. That report was lodged at Ganeshpeth police station at about 9.30 p.m. on the same date-February 12, 1956-against Inayatullah alias Kalia and Tantu, that they had attacked the former with sharp-edged weapons (Ex. P  Page 3 of 12 26). The prosecution case is that the appellant Khushal was on bad terms with Baboolal who was on very friendly terms with the leaders of the opposite faction aforesaid. Being infuriated by the conduct of Baboolal in associating with the enemies of the party of the accused, Sampat, Mahadeo, Khushal and Tukaram 555 suddenly attacked Baboolal with swords and spears and in flicted injuries on different parts of his body. The occur rence took place in a narrow lane of Nagpur at about 9 p.m. Baboolal was taken by his father and other persons to the Mayo hospital where he reached at about 925 p.m. The doctor in attendance Dr. Kanikdale (P.W. 14) at once questioned him about the incident and Baboolat is said to have made a statement to the doctor which the latter noted in the bed head ticket (Ex. P-17) that he had been assaulted by Khu shal and Tukaram with swords and spears. After noting the statement aforesaid, of Baboolal, the doctor telephoned to the Ganeshpeth police station where the information was noted at 9.45 p.m. On receiving the information, Sub-Inspec tor A. K. Khan recorded ’Ex. P-1) and registered an offence under s. 307, Indian Penal Code, and immediately went to the Mayo hospital along with a head-constable and several con stables. He found Baboolal in a serious condition and suspecting that he might not survive and apprebending that it might take time for the magistrate to be informed and to be at the spot, to record the dying declaration, he consult ed Dr. Ingle, the attending doctor, whether Baboolal was in a fit condition to make a statement. The doctor advised him to have the dying declaration recorded by a magistrate. The Sub-Inspector decided that it would be more advisable for him to record the dying declaration without any delay. Hence, he actually recorded Baboolal’s statement in answer to the questions put by him (Ex. P-2) at 10-15 p.m. In the meantime, Shri M. S. Khetkar, a magistrate, first class, was called in, and he recorded the dying declaration (Ex. P-16) between 11-15 and 11-35 p.m. in the presence of Dr. Ingle who certified that he had examined Baboolal and had found him mentally in a fit condition to make his dying declara tion. Besides these three dying declarations recorded in quick succession, as aforesaid, by responsible public serv ants, Baboolal is said to have made oral statements to a number of persons, which it is not necessary to set out because the High Court has not acted upon those oral dying declarations. We 71 556 shall have to advert, later, to the recorded dying declara tions in some detail, in the course of this judgment. It is enough to say at this stage that the courts below have founded their orders of conviction of the appellant mainly on those dying declarations. Baboolal died the next morning at about 10 a.m. in hospital. Having come to know the names of two of the alleged assail ants of Baboolal from his recorded dying declarations, the police became busy apprehending those persons. They could not be found at their respective houses. The appellant was arrested four days later in an out-house locked from out side, of a bungalow on Seminary Hill in Nagpur. The other person named as one of the assailants, Tukaram, was arrested much later. The prosecution case is that these persons were absconding and keeping out of the way of the police. After investigation and the necessary inquiry, four persons were placed on trial and the appellant was one of them. The Additional Sessions Judge acquitted two of them and convict  Page 4 of 12 ed the remaining two the appellant and Tukaram-under s. 302. Indian Penal Code, or in the alternative, tinder s. 302, read with s. 34, Indian Penal Code. He sentenced the appel lant to death because in his opinion, he had caused Baboolal’s death intentionally, and there were no extenuat ing circumstances. He sentenced Tukaram to imprisonment for life, because in the learned Judge’s view of the case, Tukaram had acted under the instigation of the appellant. Accordingly, the learned Additional Sessions Judge made a reference to the High Court for confirmation of the sentence of death. That reference was heard along with the appeal filed by the condemned prisoner. The reference, the appeal by the convicted accused persons, as also the appeal by the Government of Madhya Pradesh, against the two accused per sons who had been acquitted by the learned trial Judge, and the revisional application for enhancement of sentence passed upon Tukaram, also filed by the State Government, were all heard together and disposed of by one judgment, 557 by a Bench consisting of Hidayatullah C. J. and Mangalmurti J. The High Court, apparently with a view to understanding the evidence adduced in the case on behalf of the parties, made a local inspection on September 17, 1956, and recorded their impressions in a note which forms part of the record of the High Court. In a very well-considered judgment, the High Court, by its judgment and orders dated October 13, 1956, acquitted Tukaram, giving him the benefit of the doubt caused chiefly by the fact that in the dying declaration (Ex. P-16) recorded by the magistrate as aforesaid, he has been described as a Teli, whereas Tukaram before the Court is a Kolhi, as stated in the charge-sheet. The doubt was further accentuated by the fact that there were three or four persons of the name of Tukaram, residing in the neigh bourhood and some of them are Telis. The High Court exam ined, in meticulous details, the evidence of the eye-wit nesses Inayatullah, P.W. 1, and Sadashiv, P.W. 3, and agreed with the trial Judge in his estimate of their testimony that those witnesses being partisan, their evidence could not be relied upon, to base a conviction. The High Court went further and came to the. conclusion that their evidence being suspect, could not be used even as corroboration, if corroboration was needed of the three dying declarations made by Baboolal, as aforesaid. They upheld the conviction and sentence of the appellant on the ground that the dying declarations were corroborated by the fact that the appel lant had been absconding and keeping out of the way of the police, and had been arrested under very suspicious circum stances. These circumstances and the alleged absconding by Tukaram were not so suspicious. as to afford corroboration against him. In that view, the High Court "" very reluctant ly "" gave the benefit of the doubt to Tukaram and allowed his appeal. The High Court also agreed with the trial Judge in acquitting the other two accused persons Sampat and Maha deo-because these two persons had not been named in the dying declarations, and the oral testimony was not of such a character as to justify conviction. Accordingly, the Gov ernment appeal and 558 application in revision were dismissed. As against the appellant, the reference made by the learned trial judge was accepted and his appeal dismissed. Thus, under the orders of the High Court, only the appellant stood convicted on the charge of murder with a sentence of death against him. He moved the High Court for a certificate under art. 134(1)(c) of the Constitution, and the High Court granted a "" certifi  Page 5 of 12 cate of fitness "". Hence, this appeal. At the outset, we must repeat what this Court has observed in a number of appeals coming up to this Court on certifi cates of fitness granted by High Courts, mainly on questions of fact. The main ground for the grant of the certificate may be reproduced in the words of the High Court itself: ""The main ground is that there is not enough evidence against the accused and that there is an error in our judg ment in holding that there was no evidence to show that Khushal whose absconding has been held to corroborate the dying declaration, was involved in a liquor case. During the course of the argument neither side drew our attention to the documents which were in the record; nor was any point made of it, though we questioned why the absconding should not be taken into consideration. Now it seems that there are one or two defence exhibits in which it has been shown that Khushal was not found in his house when he was wanted in a liquor case after a search on 5th February, 1956. In view of the fact that there is this error and the sufficien cy of the evidence might be a matter for consideration in the light of this additional evidence, we think this is a fit case for a special certificate under art. 134(1)(c) of the Constitution."" It is clear that the High Court granted the certificate of fitness under Art. 134(1)(c) of the Constitution not on any difficult question of law or procedure which it thought required to be settled by this Court, but on a question which is essentially one of fact, namely, whether there was sufficient evidence of the guilt of the accused. The latest reported case of this Court, bearing on this aspect of this appeal, is Haripada 559 Dey v. The State of West Bengal(1), to the effect that a High Court exceeds its power of granting a certificate of fitness under that article if the certificate discloses that the main ground on which it was based related to a question of fact, and that the High Court is not justified in sending up such a case for further consideration by this Court which does not, ordinarily, concern itself with deciding mere questions of fact unless such questions arise on a certifi cate granted under cls. (a) or (b) of Art. 134 (1) of the Constitution. In other words, this Court does not function’ ordinarily, as a Court of Criminal Appeal. Under the Con stitution, it has the power, and it is its duty, to hear appeals, as a Regular Court of Appeal, on facts involved in cases coming up to this Court on a certificate under Art. 134(1)(a) or (b). To the same effect are the other deci sions of this Court, referred to in the reported decision aforesaid, for example, Narsingh v. The State of Uttar Pradesh (2) Baladin v. The State of Uttar Pradesh(3) sunder Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh(4) It is, therefore, incumbent upon the High Courts to be vigilant in cases coming up before them, by way of an appli cation for a certificate of fitness under Art. 134(1) (c) of the Constitution. In view of these considerations, it has got to be held -that the certificate of fitness granted by the High Court does not satisfy the requirements of Art. 134(1)(c) of the Con stitution. The appeal on such a certificate has, therefore, to be dismissed in limine; but we have to satisfy ourselves whether there are such grounds as would justify this Court in granting special leave to appeal to this Court, if the appellant had approached this Court in that behalf. We have, therefore, examined the record of this case from that  Page 6 of 12 point of view. It appears from the judgments of the courts below that the prosecution case rests mainly upon the three dying declarations of Baboolal who died shortly after making those statements as to his assailants, in quick succession within about two and a half hours of the (1) [I956] S.C.R. 639. (2) [1955] i S.C.R. 238. (3) A.I.R. 1956 S.C. 181. (4) A.I.R. 1956 S.C.411. 560 occurrence-indeed, the first one to the doctor, was made within half an hour; as also upon the evidence of two per sons Inayatullah, P.W. I and Sadashiv, P.W. 3, who figure as eye-witnesses, and Trimbak, P.W. 2 and Ramgopal, P.W. 4, who claimed to have turned up in the nick of time, to witness the last stages of the occurrence. Though the trial Judge did not disbelieve the oral testimony of the witnesses aforesaid, and only insisted upon corroboration, the High Court was more pronounced in its view that the testimony of those four witnesses was not trustworthy. The High Court has discussed their evidence in great detail, and was not prepared to accept any part of their testimony on the ground that they were strongly partisan witnesses and that they did not come to the rescue of the victim of the murderous as sault if they were really in the neighbourhood of the place of the occurrence, as claimed by them. If we had to assess the value of that body of oral evidence, we may not have come to the same conclusion, but we proceed on the assump tion that the High Court is right in its estimate of the oral testimony adduced on behalf of the prosecution. After discussing all that evidence, the High Court took the view that it could not place any reliance on the oral testimony of what Baboolal had spoken to P.Ws. 2 and 19 when they deposed that Baboolal had named two of his assailants, namely, the appellant and Tukaram. The High Court reiied upon the three dying declarations recorded at the hospital first, by the attending doctor, second, by the Sub-Inspector of police and the third, by the magistrate, first class, between 9-25 and 11-35 p. m. As regards authenticity of the record of those three statements of the deceased, the High Court had no doubt, nor has any doubt been cast upon them by counsel for the appellant. The High Court then considered the question whether the conviction of the accused could be based on those dying declarations alone. It pointed out that in that High Court as also in other High Courts, con victions on dying declarations alone had been rested if the Court was satisfied that the dying declaration was true and, therefore, could be acted upon. But the decision of 561 this Court in Ram Nath Madhoprasad v. State of Madhya Pra desh (1) was brought to their notice, and in view of that decision, the High Court looked for corroboration of the dying declarations aforesaid. It found that corroboration in the subsequent conduct of the appellant in that, as deposed to by prosecution witness 31-the Sub-Inspector in charge of Ganeshpetli police station-the appellant could not be traced till February 16, 1956, on which day, the police obtained information to the effect that the accused had been concealing himself in the premises of Ganesh dhobi at Hazari Pahar. He went there and found the appellant sitting in a room which had been locked from the front side. He arrested the accused. The High Court did not believe the defence suggestion that the appellant bad been concealing himself for fear of the police in connection with an excise case in which be had been suspected. The records in connection with  Page 7 of 12 that case have been placed before us, and, after examining those records, we do not find any good reasons for differing from the High Court in its appreciation of the circumstances connected with the absconding of the accused. The High Court took the view that the circumstance of the appellant’s conduct in concealing himself and evading the police for a number of days was consistent with the prosecution case that he was concerned in the crime which was the subject-matter of the charge against him. Thus, in effect, the High Court found corroboration which, according to the ruling of this Court referred to above, was necessary in order to base the conviction upon the dying declarations of Baboolal. The question whether the circumstances of the appellant’s alleged keeping out of the way of the police, for a number of days after the occurrence, can be used as corroboration of the dying declarations, is not free from doubt and diffi culty. The argument on behalf of the accused that he had been keeping out of the way of the police because he was suspected in the excise case is not entirely unfounded. He had not left the city of Nagpur and gone out of the juris diction of the local police. In those circumstances we are not (1) A.I.R. 1953 S.C. 420. 562 prepared to say that the alleged absconding of the accused could afford sufficient corroboration, if corroboration of the dying declarations was needed. In this Court, a good deal of argument was addressed to us, to the effect that the ruling of this Court lays down a sound proposition of law which should have been followed by the High Court, and that the alleged fact of the accused absconding and keeping out of the way of the police could not be used as corroboration of the dying declaration. The decision of this Court in Ram Nath Madhoprasad v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1), contains the following observations, at p. 423, which have been very strongly relied upon, on behalf of the appellant, as having a great bearing upon the value to be placed upon the dying declarations: ""It is settled law that it is not safe to convict an accused person merely on the evidence furnished by a dying declara tion without further corroboration because such a statement is not made on oath and is not subject to cross-examination and because the maker of it might be mentally and physically in a state of confusion and might well be drawing upon his imagination while he was making the declaration. It is in this light that the different dying declarations made by the deceased and sought to be proved in the case have to be considered......... We have, therefore, to examine the legal position whether it is settled law that a dying declaration by itself can, in no circumstances, be the basis of a conviction. In the first place, we have to examine the decision aforesaid of this Court from this point of view. This Court examined the evidence in detail with a view to satisfying itself that the dying declarations relied upon in that case were true. In that case, apart from the dying declarations, there was the evidence of the approver. This Court found that the evi dence of the approver and other oral testimony had been rightly rejected by the High Court. In that case also, the Court had mainly relied upon the dying declarations for basing the conviction under s. 302, (i) A.I.R. 1953 S.C. 420. 563 read with s. 34, Indian Penal Code. This Court examined for itself, the dying declarations and the other evidence bear  Page 8 of 12 ing upon the truth and reliability of the dying declara tions, and after an elaborate discussion of all that evi dence, came to the conclusion that the dying declarations did not contain ""a truthful version of what actually hap pened"". Thus after a very careful and cautious examination of the facts of the case, connected with the recording of the dying declaration, and of the other evidence in the case and of the fact that it was a dark night without any lights available at the place of occurrence, this Court distinctly came to the conclusion that the dying declaration was not true and could not be relied upon to base, upon that alone, the conviction of the appellants. It is, thus’ clear that the observations quoted above, of this Court, are in the nature of obiter dicta. But as it was insisted that those observations were binding upon the courts in India and upon us, we have to examine them with the care and caution they rightly deserve. The Legislature in its wisdom has enacted in s. 32(1) of the Evidence Act that ""When the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that person’s death comes into question"", such a statement written or verbal made by a person who is dead (omitting the unnecessary words) is itself a relevant fact. This provision has been made by the Legislature, advisedly, as a matter of sheer necessity -by way of an exception to the general rule that hearsay is no evidence and that evidence, which has not been tested by cross-exami nation, is not admissible. The purpose of cross-examination is to test the veracity of the statements made by a witness. In the view of the Legislature, that test is supplied by the solemn occasion when it was made, namely, at a time when the person making the statement was in danger of losing his life. At such a serious and solemn moment, that person is not expected to tell lies; and secondly, the test of cross examination would not be available. In such a case, the necessity of oath also has been 72 564 dispensed with for the same reasons. Thus, a statement made by a dying person as to the cause of death has been accorded by the Legislature a special sanctity which should, on first principles, be respected unless there are clear circum stances brought out in the evidence to show that the person making the statement was not in expectation of death, not that that circumstance would affect the admissibility of the statement, but only its weight. It may also be shown by evidence that a dying declaration is not reliable because it was not made at the earliest opportunity, and, thus, there was a reasonable ground to believe its having been put into the mouth of the dying man, when his power of resistance against telling a falsehood was ebbing away; or because the statement has not been properly recorded, for example, the statement bad been recorded as a result of prompting by some interested parties or was in answer to leading questions put by the recording officer, or, by the person purporting to reproduce that statement. These may be some of the circum stances which can be said to detract from the value of a dying declaration. But in our opinion, there is no absolute rule of law, or even a rule of prudence which has ripened into a rule of law, that a dying declaration unless corrobo rated by other independent evidence, is Dot fit to be acted upon, and made the basis of a conviction. No decision of this Court, apart from the decision already noticed, has been pointed out to us as an authority for the proposition  Page 9 of 12 that a dying declaration, in order to be acted upon by a court, must be corroborated by independent evidence. On the other hand, the different High Courts in India (including Burma) have taken conflicting views as to the value of a dying declaration in part or in its entirety, without any independent corroboration. For example, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, presided over by Sir John Beaumont C.J., has laid down in the case of Emperor v. Akbarali Karimbhai (I), that a statement which is covered by s. 32(1) of the Evidence Act is relevant evidence and has to be judged on the same principles as other evidence, bearing in mind that such a (i) I.L.R. (1932) 56 Bom. 31. 565 declaration was not made on oath and was not subject to cross-examination, and is, therefore, a weaker type ,of evidence than that given by a witness on oath. Therefore, if a part of a dying declaration is deliberately false, it will not be safe to act upon the other part of the declara tion without very definite corroboration, That Bench also ruled that it is not correct to postulate that because some part of the dying declaration is false, the whole declara tion must necessarily be disregarded. The Bombay High Court, thus, did not agree with the observations of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Emperor v. Premananda Dutt (1) to the effect that it is not permissible to accept a dying declaration in part and to reject the other part and that a dying declaration stood on a widely different footing from the testimony of a witness given in court. On the other hand, we have the decision of the Rangoon High Court, reported in the case of the King v. Maung Po Thi (2). In that case, the positive evidence led on behalf of the prose cution was found to have been tampered with and unreliable. The Court set aside the order of acquittal passed by the trial judge, and recorded an order of conviction for murder, practically on the dying declaration of the victim of the crime. The Court observed that there was. no such rule of prudence as had been invoked in aid of the accused by the trial judge who had observed that an accusation by a dying man, without corroboration from an independent source, could not be the sole basis for conviction. The learned Judges of the High Court further observed that in order to found on a dying declaration alone, a judgment of conviction of an accused person, the Court must be fully satisfied that the dying declaration has the impress of truth on it, after examining all the circumstances in which the dying person made his statement ex-parte and without the accused having the opportunity of cross-examining him. If, on such an examination, the Court was satisfied that the dying declara tion was the true version of the occurrence, conviction could be based solely upon it. (1) (1925) I.L.R. 52 Cal. 987. (2) A.I.R. 1938 Rang. 282 566 In the High Court of Madras, there was a difference of judicial opinion, as expressed in certain unreported cases, which resulted in a reference to a Full Bench. Sir Lionel Leach C. J. presiding over the Full Bench (In re, Guruswami Tevar (1) ), delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court after examining the decisions of that High Court and of other High Courts in India. His conclusions are expressed in the penultimate paragraph of his judgment, thus: "" In my judgment it is not possible to lay down any hard and fast rule when a dying declaration should be accepted, beyond saying that each case must be decided in the light of the other facts and the surrounding circumstances, but if   12 the Court, after taking everything into consideration, is convinced that the statement is true, it is its duty to convict, notwithstanding that there is no corroboration in the true sense. The Court must, of course, be fully con vinced of the truth of the statement and, naturally, it could not be fully convinced if there were anything in the other evidence or in the surrounding circumstances to raise suspicion as to its credibility."" To the same effect are the decisions of the Patna High Court in the case of Mohamad Arif v. Emperor(2), and of the Nag pur. High Court in Gulabrao Krishnajee Maratha v. King Emperor(3). The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had to consider, in the case of Chandrasekera alias Alisandiri v. The King(4), the question whether mere signs made by the victim of a murderous attack which had resulted in the cutting of the throat, thus, disabling her from speaking out, could come within the meaning of s. 32 of the Ceylon Evidence Ordinance, which was analogous to S. 32(1) of the Indian Evidence Act. The Pi-ivy Council affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court of Ceylon, and made the following observa tions in the course of their judgment, which would suggest that a dying declaration, if found reliable by a jury, may, by itself, sustain a conviction: (1) I.L.R. [1940] Mad. 158,170. (2) A.I.R. 1941 Patna 409. (3) I.L.R. [1945] Nag. 613; A.I.R. 1945 Nag. 153. (4) [I937] A.C. 220, 229. 567 ""...... Apart from the evidence proceeding from the deceased woman, the other evidence was not sufficient to warrant a conviction, but at the same time that other evidence was not merely consistent with the deceased’s statement but pointed in the same direction.’ It was.% case in which, if the deceased’s statement was received, and was believed, as it evidently was by the jury, to be clear and unmistakable in its effect, then a conviction was abundantly justified and, indeed, inevitable."" In ’Phipson on Evidence’, 9th ed., p. 335, the author has discussed the question Whether, a dying declaration without other evidence in corroboration, could be sufficient for a conviction, and has made the following observations which are pertinent to this case : ""...... The deceased then signed a statement implicating the prisoner, but which was not elicited by question and answer, and died on March 20. It was objected that being begun in that form, it was inadmissible:-Held (1) the questions and answers as to his state of mind were no part of the dying declaration; (2) that even if they were, they only affected its weight, not its admissibility ; and (3) that the decla ration was sufficient, without other evidence, for convic tion (R. v. Fitzpatrick (1910) 46 Ir. L.T.R. 173, C.C.R)."" Sometimes, attempts have been made to equate a dying decla ration with the evidence of an accomplice or the evidence furnished by a confession as against the maker, if it is retracted, and as against others, even though not retracted. But,,in our opinion, it is not right in principle to do so. Though under s. 133 of the Evidence Act, it is not illegal to convict a person on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, illustration (b) to s. 114 of the Act lays down as a rule of prudence based on experience, that an accom plice is unworthy of credit unless his evidence is corrobo rated in material particulars and this has now been accepted as a rule of law. The same cannot be said of a dying decla ration because a dying declaration may not, unlike a confes   of 12 sion, or the testimony of an approver, come from a tainted source. If a dying 568 declaration has been made by a person whose antecedents are as doubtful as in the other cases, that may be a ground for looking upon it with suspicion, but generally speaking, the maker of a dying declaration cannot be tarnished with the same brush as the maker of a confession or an approver. On a review of the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act and of the decided cases in the different High Courts in India and in this Court, we have come to the conclusion, in agreement with the opinion of the Full Bench of the Madras High Court, aforesaid, (1) that it cannot be laid down as an absolute rule of law that a dying declaration cannot form the sole basis of conviction unless it is corroborated; (2) that each case must be determined on its own facts keeping in view the circumstances in which the dying decla ration was made ; (3) that it cannot be laid down as a general proposition that a dying declaration is a weaker kind of evidence than other pieces of evidence; (4) that a dying declaration stands on the same footing as another piece of evidence and has to be judged in the light of surrounding circumstances and with reference to the princi ples governing the weighing of evidence; (5) that a dying declaration which has been recorded by a competent magis trate in the proper manner, that is to say, in the form of questions -and answers, and, as far as practicable, in the words of the maker of the declaration, stands on a much higher footing than a dying declaration which depends upon oral testimony which may suffer from all the infirmities of human, memory and human character, and (6) that in order to test the reliability of a dying declaration, the Court has to keep in view the. circumstances like the opportunity of the dying man for observation, for example, whether there was sufficient light if the crime was committed at night; whether the capacity of the man to remember the facts stated had not been impaired at the time he was making the state ment, by circumstances beyond his control; that the state ment has been consistent throughout if he had several oppor tunities of making a dying declaration apart from the offi cial record of it-; and that the statement had been made at the 569 earliest opportunity and was not the result of tutoring by interested parties. Hence, in order to pass the test of reliability, a dying declaration has to be subjected to a very close scrutiny, keeping in view the fact that the statement has been made in the absence of the accused who had no opportunity of testing the veracity of the statement by cross-examination. But once the court has come to the conclusion that the dying declaration was the truthful version as to the circumstances of the, death and the assailants of the victim, there is no question of further corroboration. If, on the other hand, the court, after examining the dying declaration in all its aspects, and testing its veracity has come to the conclusion that it is not reliable by itself, and that it suffers from an infirmity, then, without corroboration it cannot form the basis of a conviction. Thus, the -necessity for corrobora tion arises not from any inherent weakness of a dying decla ration as a piece of evidence, as held in some of the re ported cases, but from the fact that the court, in a given case, has come to the conclusion that that particular dying declaration was not free from the infirmities referred to above or from such other infirmities as may be disclosed in   of 12 evidence in that case. Having made the general observations bearing on the question of the legality of basing a conviction on a dying declara tion alone, and keeping in view the tests set out above, let us examine the dying declarations now in question before us. The most remarkable fact which emerges from an examination of the three successive dying declarations made in the course of about two hours, by the deceased, is that he con sistently named the appellant and Tukaram as the persons who had assaulted him with sword and spear. The injuries found on his person, namely, the punctured wounds and the incised wounds on different parts, of his body, are entirely con sistent with his statement that he was attacked by a number of persons with cutting and piercing weapons. No part of his dying declarations has been shown to be false. Of the two assailants named by him, Tukaram was convicted by the learned trial judge, but acquitted 570 by the High Court which very reluctantly gave him the bene fit of the doubt created by the similarity of names in that locality, as already stated. There was no such confusion in the case of the appellant. The deceased indicated that there were two more persons concerned in the crime, but he could not name them. The other two accused persons who were acquitted by the courts below had not been named in the dying declarations and, therefore, their acquittal did not, in any way militate against the truth of the dying declara tions. The courts below also agreed in holding that Babool al was in a position to see his assailants and to identify them in the light of the electric lamp nearby. They have also pointed out that there was no ""coaching"". There is no doubt, therefore, that Baboolal had been consistent through out in naming the appellant as one of his assailants, and he named him within less than half an hour of the occurrence and as soon as he reached the Mayo Hospital. There was, thus, no opportunity or time to tutor the dying man to tell a lie. At all material times, he was in a proper state of mind in spite of multiple injuries on his person, to remem ber the names of his assailants. Hence, we have no reasons to doubt the truth of the dying declarations and their reliability. We have also no doubt that from the legal and from the practical points of view, the dying declarations of the deceased Baboolal are sufficient to sustain the appellant’s conviction for murder. The only other question that remains to be considered is whether there are any extenuating circumstances in favour of the accused justify ing the lesser of the two sentences prescribed by law. In our opinion, there are none. It was a case of a deliberate cold-blooded murder. For the reasons given above, we uphold the judgment and order of the High Court convicting the appellant of murder and sentencing him to death. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed. Appeal dismissed. 57","JUDGMENT: CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: criminal Appeal No. 184 of 1956. Appeal.. from the judgment and order dated October 15, 1956, of the former Nagpur High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 205 of 1956 and Criminal Reference No. 15 of 1956, arising out of the judgment and order dated July 10, 1956, of the First Additional District Judge, Nagpur in Sessions Trial No. 34 of 1956. 554 J. N. Banerjee and P. C. Agarwala, for the appellant. Jindra Lal and R.H.Dhebdr, for the respondent. 1957. September 25. The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by SINHA J.-This appeal on a certificate of fitness under Art. 134(1)(c), granted by the High Court at Nagpur (as it then was), is directed against the concurrent judgment and orders of the courts below, so far as the appellant Khushal is concerned, convicting and sentencing him to death under s. 302, Indian Penal Code, for the pre-meditated murder of Baboolal on the night of February 12, 1956, in one of the quarters of the city of Nagpur. It appears that there are two rival factions in what has been called the Mill area in Nagpur. The appellant and Tukaram who has been acquitted by the High Court, are the leaders of one of the factions, and Ramgopal, P.W. 4, Inaya tullah, P.W. 1, and Tantu, P.W. 5, are said to be the lead ers of the opposite faction. Before the time and date of the occurrence, there had been a number of incidents between the two rival factions in respect of some of which Inayatul lah and Tantu aforesaid had been prosecuted. Even on the date of the occurrence, apart from the one leading to the murder of Baboolal, which is the subject-matter of the present appeal, Tantu and Inayatullah had made two separate reports about the attacks on them by Khushal’s party. There was another report lodged by Sampat-one of the four persons placed on trial along with the appellant, for the murder of Baboolal. That report was lodged at Ganeshpeth police station at about 9.30 p.m. on the same date-February 12, 1956-against Inayatullah alias Kalia and Tantu, that they had attacked the former with sharp-edged weapons (Ex. P  Page 3 of 12 26). The prosecution case is that the appellant Khushal was on bad terms with Baboolal who was on very friendly terms with the leaders of the opposite faction aforesaid. Being infuriated by the conduct of Baboolal in associating with the enemies of the party of the accused, Sampat, Mahadeo, Khushal and Tukaram 555 suddenly attacked Baboolal with swords and spears and in flicted injuries on different parts of his body. The occur rence took place in a narrow lane of Nagpur at about 9 p.m. Baboolal was taken by his father and other persons to the Mayo hospital where he reached at about 925 p.m. The doctor in attendance Dr. Kanikdale (P.W. 14) at once questioned him about the incident and Baboolat is said to have made a statement to the doctor which the latter noted in the bed head ticket (Ex. P-17) that he had been assaulted by Khu shal and Tukaram with swords and spears. After noting the statement aforesaid, of Baboolal, the doctor telephoned to the Ganeshpeth police station where the information was noted at 9.45 p.m. On receiving the information, Sub-Inspec tor A. K. Khan recorded ’Ex. P-1) and registered an offence under s. 307, Indian Penal Code, and immediately went to the Mayo hospital along with a head-constable and several con stables. He found Baboolal in a serious condition and suspecting that he might not survive and apprebending that it might take time for the magistrate to be informed and to be at the spot, to record the dying declaration, he consult ed Dr. Ingle, the attending doctor, whether Baboolal was in a fit condition to make a statement. The doctor advised him to have the dying declaration recorded by a magistrate. The Sub-Inspector decided that it would be more advisable for him to record the dying declaration without any delay. Hence, he actually recorded Baboolal’s statement in answer to the questions put by him (Ex. P-2) at 10-15 p.m. In the meantime, Shri M. S. Khetkar, a magistrate, first class, was called in, and he recorded the dying declaration (Ex. P-16) between 11-15 and 11-35 p.m. in the presence of Dr. Ingle who certified that he had examined Baboolal and had found him mentally in a fit condition to make his dying declara tion. Besides these three dying declarations recorded in quick succession, as aforesaid, by responsible public serv ants, Baboolal is said to have made oral statements to a number of persons, which it is not necessary to set out because the High Court has not acted upon those oral dying declarations. We 71 556 shall have to advert, later, to the recorded dying declara tions in some detail, in the course of this judgment. It is enough to say at this stage that the courts below have founded their orders of conviction of the appellant mainly on those dying declarations. Baboolal died the next morning at about 10 a.m. in hospital. Having come to know the names of two of the alleged assail ants of Baboolal from his recorded dying declarations, the police became busy apprehending those persons. They could not be found at their respective houses. The appellant was arrested four days later in an out-house locked from out side, of a bungalow on Seminary Hill in Nagpur. The other person named as one of the assailants, Tukaram, was arrested much later. The prosecution case is that these persons were absconding and keeping out of the way of the police. After investigation and the necessary inquiry, four persons were placed on trial and the appellant was one of them. The Additional Sessions Judge acquitted two of them and convict  Page 4 of 12 ed the remaining two the appellant and Tukaram-under s. 302. Indian Penal Code, or in the alternative, tinder s. 302, read with s. 34, Indian Penal Code. He sentenced the appel lant to death because in his opinion, he had caused Baboolal’s death intentionally, and there were no extenuat ing circumstances. He sentenced Tukaram to imprisonment for life, because in the learned Judge’s view of the case, Tukaram had acted under the instigation of the appellant. Accordingly, the learned Additional Sessions Judge made a reference to the High Court for confirmation of the sentence of death. That reference was heard along with the appeal filed by the condemned prisoner. The reference, the appeal by the convicted accused persons, as also the appeal by the Government of Madhya Pradesh, against the two accused per sons who had been acquitted by the learned trial Judge, and the revisional application for enhancement of sentence passed upon Tukaram, also filed by the State Government, were all heard together and disposed of by one judgment, 557 by a Bench consisting of Hidayatullah C. J. and Mangalmurti J. The High Court, apparently with a view to understanding the evidence adduced in the case on behalf of the parties, made a local inspection on September 17, 1956, and recorded their impressions in a note which forms part of the record of the High Court. In a very well-considered judgment, the High Court, by its judgment and orders dated October 13, 1956, acquitted Tukaram, giving him the benefit of the doubt caused chiefly by the fact that in the dying declaration (Ex. P-16) recorded by the magistrate as aforesaid, he has been described as a Teli, whereas Tukaram before the Court is a Kolhi, as stated in the charge-sheet. The doubt was further accentuated by the fact that there were three or four persons of the name of Tukaram, residing in the neigh bourhood and some of them are Telis. The High Court exam ined, in meticulous details, the evidence of the eye-wit nesses Inayatullah, P.W. 1, and Sadashiv, P.W. 3, and agreed with the trial Judge in his estimate of their testimony that those witnesses being partisan, their evidence could not be relied upon, to base a conviction. The High Court went further and came to the. conclusion that their evidence being suspect, could not be used even as corroboration, if corroboration was needed of the three dying declarations made by Baboolal, as aforesaid. They upheld the conviction and sentence of the appellant on the ground that the dying declarations were corroborated by the fact that the appel lant had been absconding and keeping out of the way of the police, and had been arrested under very suspicious circum stances. These circumstances and the alleged absconding by Tukaram were not so suspicious. as to afford corroboration against him. In that view, the High Court "" very reluctant ly "" gave the benefit of the doubt to Tukaram and allowed his appeal. The High Court also agreed with the trial Judge in acquitting the other two accused persons Sampat and Maha deo-because these two persons had not been named in the dying declarations, and the oral testimony was not of such a character as to justify conviction. Accordingly, the Gov ernment appeal and 558 application in revision were dismissed. As against the appellant, the reference made by the learned trial judge was accepted and his appeal dismissed. Thus, under the orders of the High Court, only the appellant stood convicted on the charge of murder with a sentence of death against him. He moved the High Court for a certificate under art. 134(1)(c) of the Constitution, and the High Court granted a "" certifi  Page 5 of 12 cate of fitness "". Hence, this appeal. At the outset, we must repeat what this Court has observed in a number of appeals coming up to this Court on certifi cates of fitness granted by High Courts, mainly on questions of fact. The main ground for the grant of the certificate may be reproduced in the words of the High Court itself: ""The main ground is that there is not enough evidence against the accused and that there is an error in our judg ment in holding that there was no evidence to show that Khushal whose absconding has been held to corroborate the dying declaration, was involved in a liquor case. During the course of the argument neither side drew our attention to the documents which were in the record; nor was any point made of it, though we questioned why the absconding should not be taken into consideration. Now it seems that there are one or two defence exhibits in which it has been shown that Khushal was not found in his house when he was wanted in a liquor case after a search on 5th February, 1956. In view of the fact that there is this error and the sufficien cy of the evidence might be a matter for consideration in the light of this additional evidence, we think this is a fit case for a special certificate under art. 134(1)(c) of the Constitution."" It is clear that the High Court granted the certificate of fitness under Art. 134(1)(c) of the Constitution not on any difficult question of law or procedure which it thought required to be settled by this Court, but on a question which is essentially one of fact, namely, whether there was sufficient evidence of the guilt of the accused. The latest reported case of this Court, bearing on this aspect of this appeal, is Haripada 559 Dey v. The State of West Bengal(1), to the effect that a High Court exceeds its power of granting a certificate of fitness under that article if the certificate discloses that the main ground on which it was based related to a question of fact, and that the High Court is not justified in sending up such a case for further consideration by this Court which does not, ordinarily, concern itself with deciding mere questions of fact unless such questions arise on a certifi cate granted under cls. (a) or (b) of Art. 134 (1) of the Constitution. In other words, this Court does not function’ ordinarily, as a Court of Criminal Appeal. Under the Con stitution, it has the power, and it is its duty, to hear appeals, as a Regular Court of Appeal, on facts involved in cases coming up to this Court on a certificate under Art. 134(1)(a) or (b). To the same effect are the other deci sions of this Court, referred to in the reported decision aforesaid, for example, Narsingh v. The State of Uttar Pradesh (2) Baladin v. The State of Uttar Pradesh(3) sunder Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh(4) It is, therefore, incumbent upon the High Courts to be vigilant in cases coming up before them, by way of an appli cation for a certificate of fitness under Art. 134(1) (c) of the Constitution. In view of these considerations, it has got to be held -that the certificate of fitness granted by the High Court does not satisfy the requirements of Art. 134(1)(c) of the Con stitution. The appeal on such a certificate has, therefore, to be dismissed in limine; but we have to satisfy ourselves whether there are such grounds as would justify this Court in granting special leave to appeal to this Court, if the appellant had approached this Court in that behalf. We have, therefore, examined the record of this case from that  Page 6 of 12 point of view. It appears from the judgments of the courts below that the prosecution case rests mainly upon the three dying declarations of Baboolal who died shortly after making those statements as to his assailants, in quick succession within about two and a half hours of the (1) [I956] S.C.R. 639. (2) [1955] i S.C.R. 238. (3) A.I.R. 1956 S.C. 181. (4) A.I.R. 1956 S.C.411. 560 occurrence-indeed, the first one to the doctor, was made within half an hour; as also upon the evidence of two per sons Inayatullah, P.W. I and Sadashiv, P.W. 3, who figure as eye-witnesses, and Trimbak, P.W. 2 and Ramgopal, P.W. 4, who claimed to have turned up in the nick of time, to witness the last stages of the occurrence. Though the trial Judge did not disbelieve the oral testimony of the witnesses aforesaid, and only insisted upon corroboration, the High Court was more pronounced in its view that the testimony of those four witnesses was not trustworthy. The High Court has discussed their evidence in great detail, and was not prepared to accept any part of their testimony on the ground that they were strongly partisan witnesses and that they did not come to the rescue of the victim of the murderous as sault if they were really in the neighbourhood of the place of the occurrence, as claimed by them. If we had to assess the value of that body of oral evidence, we may not have come to the same conclusion, but we proceed on the assump tion that the High Court is right in its estimate of the oral testimony adduced on behalf of the prosecution. After discussing all that evidence, the High Court took the view that it could not place any reliance on the oral testimony of what Baboolal had spoken to P.Ws. 2 and 19 when they deposed that Baboolal had named two of his assailants, namely, the appellant and Tukaram. The High Court reiied upon the three dying declarations recorded at the hospital first, by the attending doctor, second, by the Sub-Inspector of police and the third, by the magistrate, first class, between 9-25 and 11-35 p. m. As regards authenticity of the record of those three statements of the deceased, the High Court had no doubt, nor has any doubt been cast upon them by counsel for the appellant. The High Court then considered the question whether the conviction of the accused could be based on those dying declarations alone. It pointed out that in that High Court as also in other High Courts, con victions on dying declarations alone had been rested if the Court was satisfied that the dying declaration was true and, therefore, could be acted upon. But the decision of 561 this Court in Ram Nath Madhoprasad v. State of Madhya Pra desh (1) was brought to their notice, and in view of that decision, the High Court looked for corroboration of the dying declarations aforesaid. It found that corroboration in the subsequent conduct of the appellant in that, as deposed to by prosecution witness 31-the Sub-Inspector in charge of Ganeshpetli police station-the appellant could not be traced till February 16, 1956, on which day, the police obtained information to the effect that the accused had been concealing himself in the premises of Ganesh dhobi at Hazari Pahar. He went there and found the appellant sitting in a room which had been locked from the front side. He arrested the accused. The High Court did not believe the defence suggestion that the appellant bad been concealing himself for fear of the police in connection with an excise case in which be had been suspected. The records in connection with  Page 7 of 12 that case have been placed before us, and, after examining those records, we do not find any good reasons for differing from the High Court in its appreciation of the circumstances connected with the absconding of the accused. The High Court took the view that the circumstance of the appellant’s conduct in concealing himself and evading the police for a number of days was consistent with the prosecution case that he was concerned in the crime which was the subject-matter of the charge against him. Thus, in effect, the High Court found corroboration which, according to the ruling of this Court referred to above, was necessary in order to base the conviction upon the dying declarations of Baboolal. The question whether the circumstances of the appellant’s alleged keeping out of the way of the police, for a number of days after the occurrence, can be used as corroboration of the dying declarations, is not free from doubt and diffi culty. The argument on behalf of the accused that he had been keeping out of the way of the police because he was suspected in the excise case is not entirely unfounded. He had not left the city of Nagpur and gone out of the juris diction of the local police. In those circumstances we are not (1) A.I.R. 1953 S.C. 420. 562 prepared to say that the alleged absconding of the accused could afford sufficient corroboration, if corroboration of the dying declarations was needed. In this Court, a good deal of argument was addressed to us, to the effect that the ruling of this Court lays down a sound proposition of law which should have been followed by the High Court, and that the alleged fact of the accused absconding and keeping out of the way of the police could not be used as corroboration of the dying declaration. The decision of this Court in Ram Nath Madhoprasad v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1), contains the following observations, at p. 423, which have been very strongly relied upon, on behalf of the appellant, as having a great bearing upon the value to be placed upon the dying declarations: ""It is settled law that it is not safe to convict an accused person merely on the evidence furnished by a dying declara tion without further corroboration because such a statement is not made on oath and is not subject to cross-examination and because the maker of it might be mentally and physically in a state of confusion and might well be drawing upon his imagination while he was making the declaration. It is in this light that the different dying declarations made by the deceased and sought to be proved in the case have to be considered......... We have, therefore, to examine the legal position whether it is settled law that a dying declaration by itself can, in no circumstances, be the basis of a conviction. In the first place, we have to examine the decision aforesaid of this Court from this point of view. This Court examined the evidence in detail with a view to satisfying itself that the dying declarations relied upon in that case were true. In that case, apart from the dying declarations, there was the evidence of the approver. This Court found that the evi dence of the approver and other oral testimony had been rightly rejected by the High Court. In that case also, the Court had mainly relied upon the dying declarations for basing the conviction under s. 302, (i) A.I.R. 1953 S.C. 420. 563 read with s. 34, Indian Penal Code. This Court examined for itself, the dying declarations and the other evidence bear  Page 8 of 12 ing upon the truth and reliability of the dying declara tions, and after an elaborate discussion of all that evi dence, came to the conclusion that the dying declarations did not contain ""a truthful version of what actually hap pened"". Thus after a very careful and cautious examination of the facts of the case, connected with the recording of the dying declaration, and of the other evidence in the case and of the fact that it was a dark night without any lights available at the place of occurrence, this Court distinctly came to the conclusion that the dying declaration was not true and could not be relied upon to base, upon that alone, the conviction of the appellants. It is, thus’ clear that the observations quoted above, of this Court, are in the nature of obiter dicta. But as it was insisted that those observations were binding upon the courts in India and upon us, we have to examine them with the care and caution they rightly deserve. The Legislature in its wisdom has enacted in s. 32(1) of the Evidence Act that ""When the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that person’s death comes into question"", such a statement written or verbal made by a person who is dead (omitting the unnecessary words) is itself a relevant fact. This provision has been made by the Legislature, advisedly, as a matter of sheer necessity -by way of an exception to the general rule that hearsay is no evidence and that evidence, which has not been tested by cross-exami nation, is not admissible. The purpose of cross-examination is to test the veracity of the statements made by a witness. In the view of the Legislature, that test is supplied by the solemn occasion when it was made, namely, at a time when the person making the statement was in danger of losing his life. At such a serious and solemn moment, that person is not expected to tell lies; and secondly, the test of cross examination would not be available. In such a case, the necessity of oath also has been 72 564 dispensed with for the same reasons. Thus, a statement made by a dying person as to the cause of death has been accorded by the Legislature a special sanctity which should, on first principles, be respected unless there are clear circum stances brought out in the evidence to show that the person making the statement was not in expectation of death, not that that circumstance would affect the admissibility of the statement, but only its weight. It may also be shown by evidence that a dying declaration is not reliable because it was not made at the earliest opportunity, and, thus, there was a reasonable ground to believe its having been put into the mouth of the dying man, when his power of resistance against telling a falsehood was ebbing away; or because the statement has not been properly recorded, for example, the statement bad been recorded as a result of prompting by some interested parties or was in answer to leading questions put by the recording officer, or, by the person purporting to reproduce that statement. These may be some of the circum stances which can be said to detract from the value of a dying declaration. But in our opinion, there is no absolute rule of law, or even a rule of prudence which has ripened into a rule of law, that a dying declaration unless corrobo rated by other independent evidence, is Dot fit to be acted upon, and made the basis of a conviction. No decision of this Court, apart from the decision already noticed, has been pointed out to us as an authority for the proposition  Page 9 of 12 that a dying declaration, in order to be acted upon by a court, must be corroborated by independent evidence. On the other hand, the different High Courts in India (including Burma) have taken conflicting views as to the value of a dying declaration in part or in its entirety, without any independent corroboration. For example, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, presided over by Sir John Beaumont C.J., has laid down in the case of Emperor v. Akbarali Karimbhai (I), that a statement which is covered by s. 32(1) of the Evidence Act is relevant evidence and has to be judged on the same principles as other evidence, bearing in mind that such a (i) I.L.R. (1932) 56 Bom. 31. 565 declaration was not made on oath and was not subject to cross-examination, and is, therefore, a weaker type ,of evidence than that given by a witness on oath. Therefore, if a part of a dying declaration is deliberately false, it will not be safe to act upon the other part of the declara tion without very definite corroboration, That Bench also ruled that it is not correct to postulate that because some part of the dying declaration is false, the whole declara tion must necessarily be disregarded. The Bombay High Court, thus, did not agree with the observations of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Emperor v. Premananda Dutt (1) to the effect that it is not permissible to accept a dying declaration in part and to reject the other part and that a dying declaration stood on a widely different footing from the testimony of a witness given in court. On the other hand, we have the decision of the Rangoon High Court, reported in the case of the King v. Maung Po Thi (2). In that case, the positive evidence led on behalf of the prose cution was found to have been tampered with and unreliable. The Court set aside the order of acquittal passed by the trial judge, and recorded an order of conviction for murder, practically on the dying declaration of the victim of the crime. The Court observed that there was. no such rule of prudence as had been invoked in aid of the accused by the trial judge who had observed that an accusation by a dying man, without corroboration from an independent source, could not be the sole basis for conviction. The learned Judges of the High Court further observed that in order to found on a dying declaration alone, a judgment of conviction of an accused person, the Court must be fully satisfied that the dying declaration has the impress of truth on it, after examining all the circumstances in which the dying person made his statement ex-parte and without the accused having the opportunity of cross-examining him. If, on such an examination, the Court was satisfied that the dying declara tion was the true version of the occurrence, conviction could be based solely upon it. (1) (1925) I.L.R. 52 Cal. 987. (2) A.I.R. 1938 Rang. 282 566 In the High Court of Madras, there was a difference of judicial opinion, as expressed in certain unreported cases, which resulted in a reference to a Full Bench. Sir Lionel Leach C. J. presiding over the Full Bench (In re, Guruswami Tevar (1) ), delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court after examining the decisions of that High Court and of other High Courts in India. His conclusions are expressed in the penultimate paragraph of his judgment, thus: "" In my judgment it is not possible to lay down any hard and fast rule when a dying declaration should be accepted, beyond saying that each case must be decided in the light of the other facts and the surrounding circumstances, but if   12 the Court, after taking everything into consideration, is convinced that the statement is true, it is its duty to convict, notwithstanding that there is no corroboration in the true sense. The Court must, of course, be fully con vinced of the truth of the statement and, naturally, it could not be fully convinced if there were anything in the other evidence or in the surrounding circumstances to raise suspicion as to its credibility."" To the same effect are the decisions of the Patna High Court in the case of Mohamad Arif v. Emperor(2), and of the Nag pur. High Court in Gulabrao Krishnajee Maratha v. King Emperor(3). The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had to consider, in the case of Chandrasekera alias Alisandiri v. The King(4), the question whether mere signs made by the victim of a murderous attack which had resulted in the cutting of the throat, thus, disabling her from speaking out, could come within the meaning of s. 32 of the Ceylon Evidence Ordinance, which was analogous to S. 32(1) of the Indian Evidence Act. The Pi-ivy Council affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court of Ceylon, and made the following observa tions in the course of their judgment, which would suggest that a dying declaration, if found reliable by a jury, may, by itself, sustain a conviction: (1) I.L.R. [1940] Mad. 158,170. (2) A.I.R. 1941 Patna 409. (3) I.L.R. [1945] Nag. 613; A.I.R. 1945 Nag. 153. (4) [I937] A.C. 220, 229. 567 ""...... Apart from the evidence proceeding from the deceased woman, the other evidence was not sufficient to warrant a conviction, but at the same time that other evidence was not merely consistent with the deceased’s statement but pointed in the same direction.’ It was.% case in which, if the deceased’s statement was received, and was believed, as it evidently was by the jury, to be clear and unmistakable in its effect, then a conviction was abundantly justified and, indeed, inevitable."" In ’Phipson on Evidence’, 9th ed., p. 335, the author has discussed the question Whether, a dying declaration without other evidence in corroboration, could be sufficient for a conviction, and has made the following observations which are pertinent to this case : ""...... The deceased then signed a statement implicating the prisoner, but which was not elicited by question and answer, and died on March 20. It was objected that being begun in that form, it was inadmissible:-Held (1) the questions and answers as to his state of mind were no part of the dying declaration; (2) that even if they were, they only affected its weight, not its admissibility ; and (3) that the decla ration was sufficient, without other evidence, for convic tion (R. v. Fitzpatrick (1910) 46 Ir. L.T.R. 173, C.C.R)."" Sometimes, attempts have been made to equate a dying decla ration with the evidence of an accomplice or the evidence furnished by a confession as against the maker, if it is retracted, and as against others, even though not retracted. But,,in our opinion, it is not right in principle to do so. Though under s. 133 of the Evidence Act, it is not illegal to convict a person on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, illustration (b) to s. 114 of the Act lays down as a rule of prudence based on experience, that an accom plice is unworthy of credit unless his evidence is corrobo rated in material particulars and this has now been accepted as a rule of law. The same cannot be said of a dying decla ration because a dying declaration may not, unlike a confes   of 12 sion, or the testimony of an approver, come from a tainted source. If a dying 568 declaration has been made by a person whose antecedents are as doubtful as in the other cases, that may be a ground for looking upon it with suspicion, but generally speaking, the maker of a dying declaration cannot be tarnished with the same brush as the maker of a confession or an approver. On a review of the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act and of the decided cases in the different High Courts in India and in this Court, we have come to the conclusion, in agreement with the opinion of the Full Bench of the Madras High Court, aforesaid, (1) that it cannot be laid down as an absolute rule of law that a dying declaration cannot form the sole basis of conviction unless it is corroborated; (2) that each case must be determined on its own facts keeping in view the circumstances in which the dying decla ration was made ; (3) that it cannot be laid down as a general proposition that a dying declaration is a weaker kind of evidence than other pieces of evidence; (4) that a dying declaration stands on the same footing as another piece of evidence and has to be judged in the light of surrounding circumstances and with reference to the princi ples governing the weighing of evidence; (5) that a dying declaration which has been recorded by a competent magis trate in the proper manner, that is to say, in the form of questions -and answers, and, as far as practicable, in the words of the maker of the declaration, stands on a much higher footing than a dying declaration which depends upon oral testimony which may suffer from all the infirmities of human, memory and human character, and (6) that in order to test the reliability of a dying declaration, the Court has to keep in view the. circumstances like the opportunity of the dying man for observation, for example, whether there was sufficient light if the crime was committed at night; whether the capacity of the man to remember the facts stated had not been impaired at the time he was making the state ment, by circumstances beyond his control; that the state ment has been consistent throughout if he had several oppor tunities of making a dying declaration apart from the offi cial record of it-; and that the statement had been made at the 569 earliest opportunity and was not the result of tutoring by interested parties. Hence, in order to pass the test of reliability, a dying declaration has to be subjected to a very close scrutiny, keeping in view the fact that the statement has been made in the absence of the accused who had no opportunity of testing the veracity of the statement by cross-examination. But once the court has come to the conclusion that the dying declaration was the truthful version as to the circumstances of the, death and the assailants of the victim, there is no question of further corroboration. If, on the other hand, the court, after examining the dying declaration in all its aspects, and testing its veracity has come to the conclusion that it is not reliable by itself, and that it suffers from an infirmity, then, without corroboration it cannot form the basis of a conviction. Thus, the -necessity for corrobora tion arises not from any inherent weakness of a dying decla ration as a piece of evidence, as held in some of the re ported cases, but from the fact that the court, in a given case, has come to the conclusion that that particular dying declaration was not free from the infirmities referred to above or from such other infirmities as may be disclosed in   of 12 evidence in that case. Having made the general observations bearing on the question of the legality of basing a conviction on a dying declara tion alone, and keeping in view the tests set out above, let us examine the dying declarations now in question before us. The most remarkable fact which emerges from an examination of the three successive dying declarations made in the course of about two hours, by the deceased, is that he con sistently named the appellant and Tukaram as the persons who had assaulted him with sword and spear. The injuries found on his person, namely, the punctured wounds and the incised wounds on different parts, of his body, are entirely con sistent with his statement that he was attacked by a number of persons with cutting and piercing weapons. No part of his dying declarations has been shown to be false. Of the two assailants named by him, Tukaram was convicted by the learned trial judge, but acquitted 570 by the High Court which very reluctantly gave him the bene fit of the doubt created by the similarity of names in that locality, as already stated. There was no such confusion in the case of the appellant. The deceased indicated that there were two more persons concerned in the crime, but he could not name them. The other two accused persons who were acquitted by the courts below had not been named in the dying declarations and, therefore, their acquittal did not, in any way militate against the truth of the dying declara tions. The courts below also agreed in holding that Babool al was in a position to see his assailants and to identify them in the light of the electric lamp nearby. They have also pointed out that there was no ""coaching"". There is no doubt, therefore, that Baboolal had been consistent through out in naming the appellant as one of his assailants, and he named him within less than half an hour of the occurrence and as soon as he reached the Mayo Hospital. There was, thus, no opportunity or time to tutor the dying man to tell a lie. At all material times, he was in a proper state of mind in spite of multiple injuries on his person, to remem ber the names of his assailants. Hence, we have no reasons to doubt the truth of the dying declarations and their reliability. We have also no doubt that from the legal and from the practical points of view, the dying declarations of the deceased Baboolal are sufficient to sustain the appellant’s conviction for murder. The only other question that remains to be considered is whether there are any extenuating circumstances in favour of the accused justify ing the lesser of the two sentences prescribed by law. In our opinion, there are none. It was a case of a deliberate cold-blooded murder. For the reasons given above, we uphold the judgment and order of the High Court convicting the appellant of murder and sentencing him to death. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed. Appeal dismissed. 57"

No. 75 of 1956. M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-Generalfor India and I. N. Shroff for the appellants. N. V. Phadke, T. S. Venkataraman K. R. Sharma and K. R. Chaudhury, for respondent No. I and the Intervener. 1959. May 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by 950 BHAGWATI, J.-This appeal with special leave challenges the award made by the Industrial Tribunal, Bombay, in Reference (IT) No. 75 of 1956 between the appellant and the respondents whereby the Industrial Tribunal awarded to the respondents 4 1/2 months’ basic wages as bonus for the year 1954-55 (year ending June 30, 1955). The appellant is a subsidiary of the Premier Construction Co., Ltd., and manufactures Hume Pipes. It has factories in different parts of India, Pakistan and Ceylon. The respondents are the workers employed in the appellant’s factory at Antop Hill, Wadala, Bombay. In October 1955, respondent I who are workmen represented by the Engineering Mazdoor Sabha made a demand for the payment of six-months’ wages as bonus for the year 1954-55. The matter was also referred to the Conciliation Officer requesting him to initiate Conciliation Proceedings. The Conciliation Proceedings went on before the Conciliation Officer upto March 23, 1956, on which date both the parties arrived at and executed an Agreement to refer the matter to an Industrial Tribunal for adjudication. Accordingly, on April 30, 1956, both the parties drew up and signed a joint  Page 3 of 11 application for referring the dispute for adjudication to a Tribunal and the Government of Bombay thereupon in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, by its order dated June 11, 1956, referred the following dispute to the Tribunal : "" DEMAND: Every Workman (daily rated) should be paid bonus for the year 1954-55 (year ending 30th June, 1955) equivalent to six-months’ wages without it attaching any condition thereto "". Respondent No. I filed their statement of claim before -the Tribunal on June 29, 1956. They alleged that the profits of the appellant during the year 195455 were higher than those during the year 1953-54 for which year the appellant had paid four months’ basic wages as bonus. They also alleged that the wages paid to them by the appellant fell short of the, living wage and therefore the appellant should pay the in six months’ basic wages as bonus for the relative year. 951 The appellant filed its written statement in answer on August 14, 1956. The appellant submitted that, after providing for "" the prior charges "" according to the formula laid down by the Labour Appellate Tribunal the profits made during the year under consideration did riot leave any surplus and tile, respondents were not entitled to any bonus. It denied that it bad made huge profits during the year in question and submitted that the profits made were not even sufficient to provide for "" the prior charges "", etc. The Tribunal after hearing the parties came to the conclusion that even if payment of a bonus equal to 4 1/2 months’ basic wages were made a fair surplus would be left in the hands of the appellant to the tune of Rs. 3.30 lacs and therefore awarded the same subject to the following conditions: (a) Any employee who has been dismissed for misconduct resulting in financial loss to the company shall not be entitled to bonus to the extent of the loss caused. (b) Persons who are eligible for bonus but who are no longer in the service of the company on the date of the payment shall be paid the same provided that they make a written application for the same within three months of publication of this award. Such bonus shall be paid within one month of receipt of application provided that no claim can be enforced before six weeks from the date this award becomes enforceable. Being aggrieved by the said award of the Tribunal, the appellant applied for and obtained from this Court special leave to appeal against the same under Art. 136 of the Constitution and hence this appeal. The formula evolved by the Full Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Millowners’ Association, Bombay v. Rashtreeya Mill Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay(1) is based on this idea that "" as both labour and capital contribute to the earnings of the industrial concerti, it is fair that labour should derive some benefit, if there is a surplus after meeting "" prior or necessary charges "". The following were prescribed as the first charges on (1) (1950) L.L.J. 1247 952 gross profits, viz., (1) Provision for depreciation ;(2) reserves for rehabilitation ; (3) a return at 6%on the paid up capital; (4) a return on the working capital at a lesser rate than the return on paid up capital and (5) an estimated amount in respect of the payment of income-tax. The surplus  Page 4 of 11 that remained after making the aforesaid deductions would be available for distribution among the three sharers, viz., the shareholders, the industry and the workmen [See Muir Mills Co., Ltd. v. Suti Mills Mazdoor Union, Kanpur (1) and Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen (2)]. This Full Bench -Formula has been working all throughout the country since its enunciation as aforesaid and has been found to be, in the main, fairly satisfactory. It is conducive to the benefit of both labour and capital and even though certain variations have been attempted to be made therein from time to time the main features thereof have not been substantially departed from. We feel that a formula which has been thus adopted all throughout the country and has so far worked fairly satisfactorily should be adhered,’ to, though there is scope for certain flexibility in the working thereof in accordance with the exigencies of the situation. In the working of the said formula, however, regard must be had both to the interests of capital and labour. In any given industry there are three interests involved, viz., the shareholders, the Company and the workmen and all these interests have got to get their proper share in the surplus profits ascertained after due provision is made for these "" prior charges "". The shareholders may look to larger dividends commensurate with the prosperity of the industrial concern, the company would, apart from rehabilitation and replacement of buildings, plant and machinery, look forward to expansion and satisfaction of other needs of the industry and the workmen would certainly be entitled to ask for a share in the surplus profits with a view to bridge the gap between the wages earned by them and the living wages. All these interests (1) [1955]1 1,s.C.R. 991, 998. (2) [1958] S.C.R 878, 884, 953 have, therefore, got to be duly and properly provided for having regard to the principles of social justice and once surplus profits available for distribution amongst these respective interests are determined after making due provision for the "" prior charges "" as aforesaid the Industrial Tribunal adjudicating upon the dispute would have a free hand in the distribution of the same having regard, of course, to the considerations mentioned hereinabove. But so far as the determination of the surplus profits is concerned the formula must be adhered to in its essential particulars as otherwise there would be no stability nor uniformity of practice in regard to the same. It maybe noted, ’however, that in regard to the depreciation which is a prior charge on the gross profits earned by a concern there is always a difference in the method of approach which is adopted by the income-tax authorities and by the industrial tribunals. It was pointed out by us in Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen (1) that the whole of the depreciation admissible under the Income-tax Act was not allowable in determining the available surplus. The initial depreciation and the additional depreciation were abnormal additions to the income-tax depreciation and it would not be fair to the workmen if these depreciations were rated as prior charges before the available surplus was ascertained. Considerations on which the grant of initial and additional depreciations might be justified under the Income-tax Act were different from considerations of social justice and fair apportionment on which the Full Bench Formula in regard to the payment of bonus to workmen was based. This was the reason why we held in that case that  Page 5 of 11 only normal depreciation including multiple shift depreciation, but not initial or additional depreciation should rank as prior charge. We approved of the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in U. P. Electric Supply Co., Ltd. v. Their Workmen (2) in arriving at the above conclusion and disallowed the claim of the company there to deduct the initial or additional depreciation as prior charge in bonus calculations. (1) [1958] S.C.R. 878. 120 (2) (1955) L.A.C. 659. 954 When this decision was reached we had not before us the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Surat Electricity Company’s Staff Union v. The Surat Electricity Co., Ltd. (1) where a Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal had negatived the contention that if only the "" normal "" depreciation allowed by the Income-tax law were allowed a company would be able to recoup the original cost of the assets and observed that: "" For the purpose of bonus formula the initial and additional depreciation, which are disallowed by that formula, must be ignored in fixing the written down value and in determining the period over which the normal depreciation will be allowed. The result will be a notional amount of normal depreciation ; but, as we have said repeatedly the bonus formula is a notional formula."" We have already expressed in the judgment delivered by us in Associated Cement Co., Ltd. v. Its Workmen (1) that for the purpose of the bonus formula the notional normal depreciation should be deducted from the gross profits calculated on the basis adopted in Surat Electric Supply Co. Staff Union v. Surat Electricity Co., Ltd. (1) and not merely the normal depreciation including multiple shift depreciation allowed by the income-tax authorities as stated in U. P. Electric Supply Co., Ltd. v. Their Workmen (3). It is well settled that the actual income-tax payable by the company on the basis of the full statutory depreciation allowed by the income-tax authorities for the relevant accounting year should be taken into account as a prior charge irrespective of any set off allowed by the Income-tax authorities for prior charges or any other considerations such as building up of income-tax reserves for payment of enhanced liabilities of income-tax accruing in future. It is also well settled that the calculations of the surplus available for distribution should be made having regard to the working of the industrial concern in the relevant (1) (1956) L.A.C. 443. (2) [1959] S.C.R. 925. (3) (1955) L.A.C. 659. 955 accounting year without taking into consideration the credits or debits which are referable to the working of the previous years, e.g., the refund of excess profits tax paid in the past or loss of previous years carried forward but written off in the accounting year as also any provision that may have to be made to meet future liabilities, e.g., redemption of debenture stock, or provision for Provident Fund and Gratuity and other benefits, etc., which, however, necessary they may be, cannot be included in the category of prior charges. If regard be had to the principles enunciated above it is clear that the items of Rs. 1.14 lacs representing the Lahore factory balance written off, Rs. 0.34 lacs being patents written off, and Rs. 0.09 lacs shown as loss on sale of Tardeo property cannot be allowed as proper deductions  Page 6 of 11 from the gross profits for the purposes of bonus calculations. The first two items represented debits in connection with the working of previous years. Loss of the Lahore factory had been incurred during the three previous accounting years and had been carried forward from year to year and the only thing which was done during the year under consideration was that it was then written off as irre coverable. The patents also had been worked off in previous years and the amounts spent in the purchase thereof were therefore to be written off but had reference to the working of the company during the previous years. The last item of Rs. 0.09 lacs was trivial and was therefore not pressed with the result that all these three items were rightly added back in the calculations of the gross profits of the appellant and the figure of gross profits taken at Rs. 36.21 lacs was correctly arrived at by the Tribunal. The depreciation allowed by the Tribunal was Rs. 9.82 lacs which was the full statutory depreciation allowed by the Income-tax authorities. That should not have been done and the only depreciation allowed should have been the notional normal depreciation which was agreed between the parties before us at Rs. 6.23 lacs. Working the figure of income-tax deducted by the 956 appellant on the basis adopted in Shree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen (1) the income-tax on the gross profits of Rs. 36.21 lacs less the statutory depreciation allowed by the income-tax authorities, viz., Rs. 9.82 lacs would be equivalent to 7 annas in the rupee on Rs. 26.39 lacs, i.e., Rs. 11.55 lacs thus leaving a balance of Rs. 16.82 lacs from which the other prior charges would have to be deducted in order to ascertain the distributable surplus. 6% return on the ordinary share capital and 5% return on the preference share capital would come to Rs. 4.30 lacs. The appellant, however, claimed that even on the preference shares 6% return should be allowed and not 5% even though preference shareholders were not entitled to anything beyond 5% under the terms of issue. The appellant obviously relied upon the wording of the formula: "" return at 6% on the paid up capital "" and contended that the preference shares also being paid up capital it would be entitled to a return of 6% on the preference shares for the purposes of the bonus formula even though in fact it would have to pay only 5% return on the same. We cannot accept this contention. Even though the bonus formula is a notional one we cannot ignore the fact that in no event would the appellant be bound to pay to the preference shareholders anything beyond 5% by way of return. The Full Bench Formula cannot be so literally construed. There is bound to be some flexibility therein, the 6% which is prescribed there as the return on paid up capital is not inexorable, and the Tribunals could if the circumstances warrant vary the rate of interest either by increasing or decreasing the same. On the facts of this case however there is no warrant for allowing anything beyond 5% return on preference share capital and the amount of Rs. 4.30 lacs should therefore be deducted as another prior charge from the grsos profits of the appellant. 4% return on reserves used as working capital was calculated merely at a figure of Rs. 0.29 lacs worked out on a total figure of Rs. 7,42,139. The Tribunal (1) [1938] S.C.R. 876. 957 did not take into consideration another sum of Rs. 41,81,196 which represented the depreciation fund which according to the appellant had been used as working capital during the  Page 7 of 11 year. If that had been allowed a further sum of Rs. 1.67 lacs should have been added to Rs. 0.29 lacs and the total amount of 4% return on reserves used as working capital would have amounted to Rs. 1.96 lacs. Two arguments were advanced against this contention of the appellant. One was that there was nothing like a depreciation fund, that it merely represented a credit item introduced in the balance-sheet as against the value of the fixed capital at its original cost and would have disappeared as such if the proper accounting basis had been adopted, viz., the fixed block bad been showed at its depreciated value after deducting the amount of depreciation from the original cost. Such book entries, it was contended, did not convert that credit item into a depreciation fund available to the company and there was therefore no basis for the contention that such a depreciation fund ever existed and could be used as working capital in the business. The other was that there was nothing on the record to show that such a depreciation fund, if any, had been, in fact, used as working capital in the business during that year. The answer furnished by the appellant in regard to both these contentions was that on a true reading of the balance sheet Rs. 41,81,196 were reserves used as working capital, vide calculations in Exhibit C-12. Provision for depreciation was Rs. 1,10,29,954 and the paid up capital was Rs. 80,00,000 thus totaling to Rs. 1,90,29,954. The total capital block as shown in page 5 of the balance-sheet for the year ending June 30, 1955, was Rs. 1,48,48,758 and the working capital therefore was Rs. 41,81,196. This was apart from Rs. 7,42,139 which was the total of the three items at page 4 of the balance-sheet: Rs. 98,405 capital reserves, Rs. 4,73,734 other reserves and Rs. 1,70,000 provision for doubtful debts as also the investments, cash and bank balance. This being the true position it follows on the facts of the present case that this 958 amount was available for use as working capital and the balance-sheet showed that it was in fact so used. Moreover, DO objection was urged in this behalf nor was any finding to the contrary recorded by the Tribunal. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the reasoning adopted by the Tribunal was not correct and the appellant was entitled to 4% return on the reserves used as working capital including the sum of Rs. 41,81,196. The appellant was thus entitled to Rs. 1.96 lacs as the 4% return on reserves used as working capital and not merely Rs. 0.29 lacs as allowed by the Tribunal. The provision for rehabilitation bad been claimed by the appellant at Rs. 1.10 lacs on the basis of 10% of the net profits relying upon para. 20 of the Report of the Committee on Profit Sharing in which the Committee had proposed that 10% of the net profits should compulsorily be set aside for reserves to meet emergencies as well as for rehabilitation, modernization and reasonable expansion. No evidence was at all led by the appellant before the Tribunal showing the cost of the machinery as purchased, the age of the machinery, the estimate for replacement etc., in order to substantiate this claim for rehabilitation and the appellant was content merely to rely upon this recommendation of the Committee on Profit-sharing. This was rightly considered by the Tribunal as insufficient to support the appellant’s claim, though it allowed for rehabilitation, in addition to the statutory depreciation, the amount for which the appellant had actually made provision, viz., the sum by  Page 8 of 11 which the depreciation written off for the year exceeded the statutory depreciation (i. e., Rs. 10,00,000 minus Rs. 9,82,799Rs. 17,201). The amount was really small and did not affect the bonus to be awarded. The Tribunal, in fact, allowed the same, though it appears that in the absence of evidence of the nature above referred to even that sum of Rs. 0.17 lacs ought not to have been allowed. In this state of affairs it is really impossible for us to allow the appellant’s claim for rehabilitation in anything beyond the sum of Rs. 0.17 lacs actually 959 allowed by the Tribunal and the claim of the appellant for any further provision for rehabilitation must be disallowed for the purpose of the bonus calculations for the year under consideration. It will however be open to the appellant to claim higher rehabilitation for subsequent years if it can substantiate its claim by adducing proper evidence. In addition to these various sums allowed to the appellant by way of prior charges against the gross profits earned during the accounting year the Tribunal also allowed to the appellant Rs. 2.50 lacs by way of provision for debenture redemption fund. The claim of the appellant was for a sum of Rs. 3.50 lacs for the same and it arose under the following circumstances. The appellant had issued debentures of the value of Rs. 30 lacs in the year 1942-43 and they were redeemable in the year 1962-63. No annual provision had been made from profits for redemption of the same inasmuch as until the year 1949 the appellant was not working at a profit. Such provision was made only thereafter. For the year 1950-51, the appellant made a provision for Rs. 75,000 for debenture redemption fund, for 1951.52, Rs. 1,50,000, for 1952-53 Rs. 1,50,000, for 1953-54 Rs. 75,000 and further provision had to be made for redemption of debentures in a sum of Rs. 24,50,000. In so far as 7 more years were left before the due date for redemption the appellant claimed Rs. 3,50,000 as the annual sum to be set apart, though as a matter of fact in the balance-sheet only a provision of Rs. 2,50,000 had been made by it for debenture redemption reserve. The Tribunal pointed out that when the appellant had in its accounts appropriated Rs. 2,50,000 for the debenture redemption fund the claim to have Rs. 3,50,000 for the purposes of bonus formula was clearly untenable. It however was of the opinion that a reasonable provision for redemption fund should be allowed as a prior charge and actually allowed the sum of Rs. 2,50,000 which had been actually provided for the purpose in the balance-sheet, negativing the contention of the respondents that no provision should be allowed for debenture redemption fund in the bonus formula. 960 We are of the opinion that the Tribunal was not justified in allowing the sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- for debenture redemption fund as a prior charge in the bonus calculations. The Full Bench Formula does not envisage any such prior charge. It is no doubt true that capital is shy and it would not be practicable for the industrial concern to raise large amounts by way of fresh debentures when they become due. It is also true that the debentures do not stand on a par with other debts of a concern because the debentureholders would in a conceivable situation be able to enforce their security by bringing the industry to a stand-still by taking over charge of the whole concern. It would therefore appear that the redemption of these debentures would be one of the primary obligations of the industrial concern and due provision has of necessity to be made for redemption thereof  Page 9 of 11 on due date. This however does not mean that in the calculations of the distributable surplus the provision for such redemption should be given the status of a prior charge, though of course that would be a relevant con sideration while distributing the available surplus between the various interests entitled thereto. We are therefore of opinion that the Tribunal was wrong in allowing Rs. 2,50,000/- as a prior charge in the bonus calculations. This disposes of all the contentions which have been urged on behalf of both the parties and calculating the figure on that basis we arrive atthe following Rs. in lacs. Gross Profit as per Tribudal’s calculations 36.21 Less: Notional Normal Depreciation 6.23 29.98 Less: Tax @ 7 as. in a rupee 11.55 18.43 Less: 6% return on ordinary share capital and 5% on preference share capital 4.30 14.13 961 Less: 4% Return on reserves used as working capital: 7,42,139 29 + 41,81,196 1.67 -------------------- 49,23,335 1.96 ------------ 12.17 Less:Provision for Rehabilitation 0.17 ----------- Available Surplus 12.00 This would bring the available surplusfor distribution to a sum of Rs. 12 lacs and this would be distributable amongst the shareholders, the company and the workmen concerned. It is not feasible to lay down any rigid formula as to what the proportion of such distribution amongst these various interests should be. The shareholders as well as the company would both be naturally interested inter alia in providing the debenture redemption reserves as also meeting the needs of the industry for further expansion. The workmen would no doubt be interested in trying to bridge the gap between their actual wage and the living wage to the extent feasible. This surplus of Rs. 12 lacs would have to be distributed amongst them having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, of course bearing in mind the various considerations indicated above. Before we arrive at the figure of the actual bonus which it will be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to allow to the workmen, we may advert to one argument which was pressed before us. on their behalf and that was that the bonus calculations should not be made on the basis of the All-India figures which were adopted by the Tribunal but on the basis of the actual amounts which the appellant had paid and would have to pay to the workmen concerned. It was pointed out that the respondents here were only the workmen in the Wadala Factory of the appellant. The appellant had, however, paid to the various workmen elsewhere as and by way of bonus sums varying between 4% and 29% of the basic wages for the year in question. The sum of Rs. 1,23,138/- only had been 121 962 paid in full and final settlement to the workmen in some of the factories and the bonus calculations on an All-India basis would thus work to the advantage of the appellant in   11 so far as they would result in saving to the appellant of the difference between the amounts to which those workmen would be entitled on the basis of the All-India figures adopted by the Tribunal and the amounts actually paid to them as a result of agreements, conciliation or adjudication. It was therefore contended that the calculations should be made after taking into account the savings thus effected by the appellant and only a sum of Rs. 1,23,138 /- which was the actual sum paid to those workmen should be taken into account and no more. We are afraid, we cannot accept this contention. If this contention was accepted the respondents before us would have an advantage over those workmen with whom settlements have been made and would get larger amounts by way of bonus merely by reason of the fact that the appellant had managed to settle the claims of those workmen at lesser figures. If this contention of the respondents was pushed to its logical extent it would also mean that in the event of the non-fulfilment of the conditions imposed by the Tribunal in the award of bonus herein bringing in savings in the hands of the appellant, the respondents would be entitled to take advantage of those savings also and should be awarded larger amounts by way of bonus, which would really be the result of the claimants entitled to the same not receiving it under certain circumstances-an event which would be purely an extraneous one and unconnected with the contribution of the respondents towards the gross profits earned by the appellant. The Tribunal was, therefore, right in calculating the bonus on an All-India basis. By our order dated April 12, 1957, the appellant was ordered to pay to the respondents within a fortnight from the date thereof bonus for the year 1954-55 equivalent to two months’ basic wages; that amount has already been paid and works out at Rs. 3.39 lacs on an All-India basis. The only question which therefore survives is what further bonus, if any, would the respondents be entitled 963 to from the distributable surplus of Rs. 12 lacs. The sum of Rs. 3.50 lacs required for building up the debenture redemption reserve is an all-engrossing need of the appellant and that is a factor which must of necessity be taken into consideration while arriving at the ultimate figure, particularly because such redemption of the debentures would enure not only for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders but also of the workmen employed therein. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, we feel that an award of four months’ basic wages as aggregate bonus for the year 1954-55 (which by the way was the bonus awarded for the previous year 1953-54 also) would give a fair share to the labour in the distributable surplus, leaving to the shareholders and the company a balance of Rs. 5.22 lacs to be utilised by them not only towards building up of the debenture redemption reserve but also for building up other reserves, which would be utilised for various other purposes indicated above. The appellant would no doubt get also the refund of the income-tax on the bonus payments made by it. This rebate would also go towards the fulfilment of the very same objectives, which would ultimately enure both for the benefit of the capital as well as labour. We have, therefore, come. to the conclusion that the appellant should pay to the respondents, in addition to the two months’ basic wages already paid to them in pursuance of this Court’s order dated April 12, 1957, an additional sum equivalent to two months’ basic wages by way of bonus for   of 11 the year 1954-55 subject to the same conditions as were laid down in the award of the Tribunal above referred to, all the dates mentioned therein being calculated from the date of this judgment. We accordingly allow the appeal, modify the award of the Industrial Tribunal to the extent mentioned above, but in the circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs, each party bearing and paying its own costs thereof. Appeal allowed","CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 54 of 1958. Appeal by special leave from the Award dated January 14, 1957, of the Industrial Tribunal at Bombay in Reference (I. T.) No. 75 of 1956. M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-Generalfor India and I. N. Shroff for the appellants. N. V. Phadke, T. S. Venkataraman K. R. Sharma and K. R. Chaudhury, for respondent No. I and the Intervener. 1959. May 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by 950 BHAGWATI, J.-This appeal with special leave challenges the award made by the Industrial Tribunal, Bombay, in Reference (IT) No. 75 of 1956 between the appellant and the respondents whereby the Industrial Tribunal awarded to the respondents 4 1/2 months’ basic wages as bonus for the year 1954-55 (year ending June 30, 1955). The appellant is a subsidiary of the Premier Construction Co., Ltd., and manufactures Hume Pipes. It has factories in different parts of India, Pakistan and Ceylon. The respondents are the workers employed in the appellant’s factory at Antop Hill, Wadala, Bombay. In October 1955, respondent I who are workmen represented by the Engineering Mazdoor Sabha made a demand for the payment of six-months’ wages as bonus for the year 1954-55. The matter was also referred to the Conciliation Officer requesting him to initiate Conciliation Proceedings. The Conciliation Proceedings went on before the Conciliation Officer upto March 23, 1956, on which date both the parties arrived at and executed an Agreement to refer the matter to an Industrial Tribunal for adjudication. Accordingly, on April 30, 1956, both the parties drew up and signed a joint  Page 3 of 11 application for referring the dispute for adjudication to a Tribunal and the Government of Bombay thereupon in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, by its order dated June 11, 1956, referred the following dispute to the Tribunal : "" DEMAND: Every Workman (daily rated) should be paid bonus for the year 1954-55 (year ending 30th June, 1955) equivalent to six-months’ wages without it attaching any condition thereto "". Respondent No. I filed their statement of claim before -the Tribunal on June 29, 1956. They alleged that the profits of the appellant during the year 195455 were higher than those during the year 1953-54 for which year the appellant had paid four months’ basic wages as bonus. They also alleged that the wages paid to them by the appellant fell short of the, living wage and therefore the appellant should pay the in six months’ basic wages as bonus for the relative year. 951 The appellant filed its written statement in answer on August 14, 1956. The appellant submitted that, after providing for "" the prior charges "" according to the formula laid down by the Labour Appellate Tribunal the profits made during the year under consideration did riot leave any surplus and tile, respondents were not entitled to any bonus. It denied that it bad made huge profits during the year in question and submitted that the profits made were not even sufficient to provide for "" the prior charges "", etc. The Tribunal after hearing the parties came to the conclusion that even if payment of a bonus equal to 4 1/2 months’ basic wages were made a fair surplus would be left in the hands of the appellant to the tune of Rs. 3.30 lacs and therefore awarded the same subject to the following conditions: (a) Any employee who has been dismissed for misconduct resulting in financial loss to the company shall not be entitled to bonus to the extent of the loss caused. (b) Persons who are eligible for bonus but who are no longer in the service of the company on the date of the payment shall be paid the same provided that they make a written application for the same within three months of publication of this award. Such bonus shall be paid within one month of receipt of application provided that no claim can be enforced before six weeks from the date this award becomes enforceable. Being aggrieved by the said award of the Tribunal, the appellant applied for and obtained from this Court special leave to appeal against the same under Art. 136 of the Constitution and hence this appeal. The formula evolved by the Full Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Millowners’ Association, Bombay v. Rashtreeya Mill Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay(1) is based on this idea that "" as both labour and capital contribute to the earnings of the industrial concerti, it is fair that labour should derive some benefit, if there is a surplus after meeting "" prior or necessary charges "". The following were prescribed as the first charges on (1) (1950) L.L.J. 1247 952 gross profits, viz., (1) Provision for depreciation ;(2) reserves for rehabilitation ; (3) a return at 6%on the paid up capital; (4) a return on the working capital at a lesser rate than the return on paid up capital and (5) an estimated amount in respect of the payment of income-tax. The surplus  Page 4 of 11 that remained after making the aforesaid deductions would be available for distribution among the three sharers, viz., the shareholders, the industry and the workmen [See Muir Mills Co., Ltd. v. Suti Mills Mazdoor Union, Kanpur (1) and Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen (2)]. This Full Bench -Formula has been working all throughout the country since its enunciation as aforesaid and has been found to be, in the main, fairly satisfactory. It is conducive to the benefit of both labour and capital and even though certain variations have been attempted to be made therein from time to time the main features thereof have not been substantially departed from. We feel that a formula which has been thus adopted all throughout the country and has so far worked fairly satisfactorily should be adhered,’ to, though there is scope for certain flexibility in the working thereof in accordance with the exigencies of the situation. In the working of the said formula, however, regard must be had both to the interests of capital and labour. In any given industry there are three interests involved, viz., the shareholders, the Company and the workmen and all these interests have got to get their proper share in the surplus profits ascertained after due provision is made for these "" prior charges "". The shareholders may look to larger dividends commensurate with the prosperity of the industrial concern, the company would, apart from rehabilitation and replacement of buildings, plant and machinery, look forward to expansion and satisfaction of other needs of the industry and the workmen would certainly be entitled to ask for a share in the surplus profits with a view to bridge the gap between the wages earned by them and the living wages. All these interests (1) [1955]1 1,s.C.R. 991, 998. (2) [1958] S.C.R 878, 884, 953 have, therefore, got to be duly and properly provided for having regard to the principles of social justice and once surplus profits available for distribution amongst these respective interests are determined after making due provision for the "" prior charges "" as aforesaid the Industrial Tribunal adjudicating upon the dispute would have a free hand in the distribution of the same having regard, of course, to the considerations mentioned hereinabove. But so far as the determination of the surplus profits is concerned the formula must be adhered to in its essential particulars as otherwise there would be no stability nor uniformity of practice in regard to the same. It maybe noted, ’however, that in regard to the depreciation which is a prior charge on the gross profits earned by a concern there is always a difference in the method of approach which is adopted by the income-tax authorities and by the industrial tribunals. It was pointed out by us in Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen (1) that the whole of the depreciation admissible under the Income-tax Act was not allowable in determining the available surplus. The initial depreciation and the additional depreciation were abnormal additions to the income-tax depreciation and it would not be fair to the workmen if these depreciations were rated as prior charges before the available surplus was ascertained. Considerations on which the grant of initial and additional depreciations might be justified under the Income-tax Act were different from considerations of social justice and fair apportionment on which the Full Bench Formula in regard to the payment of bonus to workmen was based. This was the reason why we held in that case that  Page 5 of 11 only normal depreciation including multiple shift depreciation, but not initial or additional depreciation should rank as prior charge. We approved of the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in U. P. Electric Supply Co., Ltd. v. Their Workmen (2) in arriving at the above conclusion and disallowed the claim of the company there to deduct the initial or additional depreciation as prior charge in bonus calculations. (1) [1958] S.C.R. 878. 120 (2) (1955) L.A.C. 659. 954 When this decision was reached we had not before us the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Surat Electricity Company’s Staff Union v. The Surat Electricity Co., Ltd. (1) where a Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal had negatived the contention that if only the "" normal "" depreciation allowed by the Income-tax law were allowed a company would be able to recoup the original cost of the assets and observed that: "" For the purpose of bonus formula the initial and additional depreciation, which are disallowed by that formula, must be ignored in fixing the written down value and in determining the period over which the normal depreciation will be allowed. The result will be a notional amount of normal depreciation ; but, as we have said repeatedly the bonus formula is a notional formula."" We have already expressed in the judgment delivered by us in Associated Cement Co., Ltd. v. Its Workmen (1) that for the purpose of the bonus formula the notional normal depreciation should be deducted from the gross profits calculated on the basis adopted in Surat Electric Supply Co. Staff Union v. Surat Electricity Co., Ltd. (1) and not merely the normal depreciation including multiple shift depreciation allowed by the income-tax authorities as stated in U. P. Electric Supply Co., Ltd. v. Their Workmen (3). It is well settled that the actual income-tax payable by the company on the basis of the full statutory depreciation allowed by the income-tax authorities for the relevant accounting year should be taken into account as a prior charge irrespective of any set off allowed by the Income-tax authorities for prior charges or any other considerations such as building up of income-tax reserves for payment of enhanced liabilities of income-tax accruing in future. It is also well settled that the calculations of the surplus available for distribution should be made having regard to the working of the industrial concern in the relevant (1) (1956) L.A.C. 443. (2) [1959] S.C.R. 925. (3) (1955) L.A.C. 659. 955 accounting year without taking into consideration the credits or debits which are referable to the working of the previous years, e.g., the refund of excess profits tax paid in the past or loss of previous years carried forward but written off in the accounting year as also any provision that may have to be made to meet future liabilities, e.g., redemption of debenture stock, or provision for Provident Fund and Gratuity and other benefits, etc., which, however, necessary they may be, cannot be included in the category of prior charges. If regard be had to the principles enunciated above it is clear that the items of Rs. 1.14 lacs representing the Lahore factory balance written off, Rs. 0.34 lacs being patents written off, and Rs. 0.09 lacs shown as loss on sale of Tardeo property cannot be allowed as proper deductions  Page 6 of 11 from the gross profits for the purposes of bonus calculations. The first two items represented debits in connection with the working of previous years. Loss of the Lahore factory had been incurred during the three previous accounting years and had been carried forward from year to year and the only thing which was done during the year under consideration was that it was then written off as irre coverable. The patents also had been worked off in previous years and the amounts spent in the purchase thereof were therefore to be written off but had reference to the working of the company during the previous years. The last item of Rs. 0.09 lacs was trivial and was therefore not pressed with the result that all these three items were rightly added back in the calculations of the gross profits of the appellant and the figure of gross profits taken at Rs. 36.21 lacs was correctly arrived at by the Tribunal. The depreciation allowed by the Tribunal was Rs. 9.82 lacs which was the full statutory depreciation allowed by the Income-tax authorities. That should not have been done and the only depreciation allowed should have been the notional normal depreciation which was agreed between the parties before us at Rs. 6.23 lacs. Working the figure of income-tax deducted by the 956 appellant on the basis adopted in Shree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen (1) the income-tax on the gross profits of Rs. 36.21 lacs less the statutory depreciation allowed by the income-tax authorities, viz., Rs. 9.82 lacs would be equivalent to 7 annas in the rupee on Rs. 26.39 lacs, i.e., Rs. 11.55 lacs thus leaving a balance of Rs. 16.82 lacs from which the other prior charges would have to be deducted in order to ascertain the distributable surplus. 6% return on the ordinary share capital and 5% return on the preference share capital would come to Rs. 4.30 lacs. The appellant, however, claimed that even on the preference shares 6% return should be allowed and not 5% even though preference shareholders were not entitled to anything beyond 5% under the terms of issue. The appellant obviously relied upon the wording of the formula: "" return at 6% on the paid up capital "" and contended that the preference shares also being paid up capital it would be entitled to a return of 6% on the preference shares for the purposes of the bonus formula even though in fact it would have to pay only 5% return on the same. We cannot accept this contention. Even though the bonus formula is a notional one we cannot ignore the fact that in no event would the appellant be bound to pay to the preference shareholders anything beyond 5% by way of return. The Full Bench Formula cannot be so literally construed. There is bound to be some flexibility therein, the 6% which is prescribed there as the return on paid up capital is not inexorable, and the Tribunals could if the circumstances warrant vary the rate of interest either by increasing or decreasing the same. On the facts of this case however there is no warrant for allowing anything beyond 5% return on preference share capital and the amount of Rs. 4.30 lacs should therefore be deducted as another prior charge from the grsos profits of the appellant. 4% return on reserves used as working capital was calculated merely at a figure of Rs. 0.29 lacs worked out on a total figure of Rs. 7,42,139. The Tribunal (1) [1938] S.C.R. 876. 957 did not take into consideration another sum of Rs. 41,81,196 which represented the depreciation fund which according to the appellant had been used as working capital during the  Page 7 of 11 year. If that had been allowed a further sum of Rs. 1.67 lacs should have been added to Rs. 0.29 lacs and the total amount of 4% return on reserves used as working capital would have amounted to Rs. 1.96 lacs. Two arguments were advanced against this contention of the appellant. One was that there was nothing like a depreciation fund, that it merely represented a credit item introduced in the balance-sheet as against the value of the fixed capital at its original cost and would have disappeared as such if the proper accounting basis had been adopted, viz., the fixed block bad been showed at its depreciated value after deducting the amount of depreciation from the original cost. Such book entries, it was contended, did not convert that credit item into a depreciation fund available to the company and there was therefore no basis for the contention that such a depreciation fund ever existed and could be used as working capital in the business. The other was that there was nothing on the record to show that such a depreciation fund, if any, had been, in fact, used as working capital in the business during that year. The answer furnished by the appellant in regard to both these contentions was that on a true reading of the balance sheet Rs. 41,81,196 were reserves used as working capital, vide calculations in Exhibit C-12. Provision for depreciation was Rs. 1,10,29,954 and the paid up capital was Rs. 80,00,000 thus totaling to Rs. 1,90,29,954. The total capital block as shown in page 5 of the balance-sheet for the year ending June 30, 1955, was Rs. 1,48,48,758 and the working capital therefore was Rs. 41,81,196. This was apart from Rs. 7,42,139 which was the total of the three items at page 4 of the balance-sheet: Rs. 98,405 capital reserves, Rs. 4,73,734 other reserves and Rs. 1,70,000 provision for doubtful debts as also the investments, cash and bank balance. This being the true position it follows on the facts of the present case that this 958 amount was available for use as working capital and the balance-sheet showed that it was in fact so used. Moreover, DO objection was urged in this behalf nor was any finding to the contrary recorded by the Tribunal. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the reasoning adopted by the Tribunal was not correct and the appellant was entitled to 4% return on the reserves used as working capital including the sum of Rs. 41,81,196. The appellant was thus entitled to Rs. 1.96 lacs as the 4% return on reserves used as working capital and not merely Rs. 0.29 lacs as allowed by the Tribunal. The provision for rehabilitation bad been claimed by the appellant at Rs. 1.10 lacs on the basis of 10% of the net profits relying upon para. 20 of the Report of the Committee on Profit Sharing in which the Committee had proposed that 10% of the net profits should compulsorily be set aside for reserves to meet emergencies as well as for rehabilitation, modernization and reasonable expansion. No evidence was at all led by the appellant before the Tribunal showing the cost of the machinery as purchased, the age of the machinery, the estimate for replacement etc., in order to substantiate this claim for rehabilitation and the appellant was content merely to rely upon this recommendation of the Committee on Profit-sharing. This was rightly considered by the Tribunal as insufficient to support the appellant’s claim, though it allowed for rehabilitation, in addition to the statutory depreciation, the amount for which the appellant had actually made provision, viz., the sum by  Page 8 of 11 which the depreciation written off for the year exceeded the statutory depreciation (i. e., Rs. 10,00,000 minus Rs. 9,82,799Rs. 17,201). The amount was really small and did not affect the bonus to be awarded. The Tribunal, in fact, allowed the same, though it appears that in the absence of evidence of the nature above referred to even that sum of Rs. 0.17 lacs ought not to have been allowed. In this state of affairs it is really impossible for us to allow the appellant’s claim for rehabilitation in anything beyond the sum of Rs. 0.17 lacs actually 959 allowed by the Tribunal and the claim of the appellant for any further provision for rehabilitation must be disallowed for the purpose of the bonus calculations for the year under consideration. It will however be open to the appellant to claim higher rehabilitation for subsequent years if it can substantiate its claim by adducing proper evidence. In addition to these various sums allowed to the appellant by way of prior charges against the gross profits earned during the accounting year the Tribunal also allowed to the appellant Rs. 2.50 lacs by way of provision for debenture redemption fund. The claim of the appellant was for a sum of Rs. 3.50 lacs for the same and it arose under the following circumstances. The appellant had issued debentures of the value of Rs. 30 lacs in the year 1942-43 and they were redeemable in the year 1962-63. No annual provision had been made from profits for redemption of the same inasmuch as until the year 1949 the appellant was not working at a profit. Such provision was made only thereafter. For the year 1950-51, the appellant made a provision for Rs. 75,000 for debenture redemption fund, for 1951.52, Rs. 1,50,000, for 1952-53 Rs. 1,50,000, for 1953-54 Rs. 75,000 and further provision had to be made for redemption of debentures in a sum of Rs. 24,50,000. In so far as 7 more years were left before the due date for redemption the appellant claimed Rs. 3,50,000 as the annual sum to be set apart, though as a matter of fact in the balance-sheet only a provision of Rs. 2,50,000 had been made by it for debenture redemption reserve. The Tribunal pointed out that when the appellant had in its accounts appropriated Rs. 2,50,000 for the debenture redemption fund the claim to have Rs. 3,50,000 for the purposes of bonus formula was clearly untenable. It however was of the opinion that a reasonable provision for redemption fund should be allowed as a prior charge and actually allowed the sum of Rs. 2,50,000 which had been actually provided for the purpose in the balance-sheet, negativing the contention of the respondents that no provision should be allowed for debenture redemption fund in the bonus formula. 960 We are of the opinion that the Tribunal was not justified in allowing the sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- for debenture redemption fund as a prior charge in the bonus calculations. The Full Bench Formula does not envisage any such prior charge. It is no doubt true that capital is shy and it would not be practicable for the industrial concern to raise large amounts by way of fresh debentures when they become due. It is also true that the debentures do not stand on a par with other debts of a concern because the debentureholders would in a conceivable situation be able to enforce their security by bringing the industry to a stand-still by taking over charge of the whole concern. It would therefore appear that the redemption of these debentures would be one of the primary obligations of the industrial concern and due provision has of necessity to be made for redemption thereof  Page 9 of 11 on due date. This however does not mean that in the calculations of the distributable surplus the provision for such redemption should be given the status of a prior charge, though of course that would be a relevant con sideration while distributing the available surplus between the various interests entitled thereto. We are therefore of opinion that the Tribunal was wrong in allowing Rs. 2,50,000/- as a prior charge in the bonus calculations. This disposes of all the contentions which have been urged on behalf of both the parties and calculating the figure on that basis we arrive atthe following Rs. in lacs. Gross Profit as per Tribudal’s calculations 36.21 Less: Notional Normal Depreciation 6.23 29.98 Less: Tax @ 7 as. in a rupee 11.55 18.43 Less: 6% return on ordinary share capital and 5% on preference share capital 4.30 14.13 961 Less: 4% Return on reserves used as working capital: 7,42,139 29 + 41,81,196 1.67 -------------------- 49,23,335 1.96 ------------ 12.17 Less:Provision for Rehabilitation 0.17 ----------- Available Surplus 12.00 This would bring the available surplusfor distribution to a sum of Rs. 12 lacs and this would be distributable amongst the shareholders, the company and the workmen concerned. It is not feasible to lay down any rigid formula as to what the proportion of such distribution amongst these various interests should be. The shareholders as well as the company would both be naturally interested inter alia in providing the debenture redemption reserves as also meeting the needs of the industry for further expansion. The workmen would no doubt be interested in trying to bridge the gap between their actual wage and the living wage to the extent feasible. This surplus of Rs. 12 lacs would have to be distributed amongst them having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, of course bearing in mind the various considerations indicated above. Before we arrive at the figure of the actual bonus which it will be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to allow to the workmen, we may advert to one argument which was pressed before us. on their behalf and that was that the bonus calculations should not be made on the basis of the All-India figures which were adopted by the Tribunal but on the basis of the actual amounts which the appellant had paid and would have to pay to the workmen concerned. It was pointed out that the respondents here were only the workmen in the Wadala Factory of the appellant. The appellant had, however, paid to the various workmen elsewhere as and by way of bonus sums varying between 4% and 29% of the basic wages for the year in question. The sum of Rs. 1,23,138/- only had been 121 962 paid in full and final settlement to the workmen in some of the factories and the bonus calculations on an All-India basis would thus work to the advantage of the appellant in   11 so far as they would result in saving to the appellant of the difference between the amounts to which those workmen would be entitled on the basis of the All-India figures adopted by the Tribunal and the amounts actually paid to them as a result of agreements, conciliation or adjudication. It was therefore contended that the calculations should be made after taking into account the savings thus effected by the appellant and only a sum of Rs. 1,23,138 /- which was the actual sum paid to those workmen should be taken into account and no more. We are afraid, we cannot accept this contention. If this contention was accepted the respondents before us would have an advantage over those workmen with whom settlements have been made and would get larger amounts by way of bonus merely by reason of the fact that the appellant had managed to settle the claims of those workmen at lesser figures. If this contention of the respondents was pushed to its logical extent it would also mean that in the event of the non-fulfilment of the conditions imposed by the Tribunal in the award of bonus herein bringing in savings in the hands of the appellant, the respondents would be entitled to take advantage of those savings also and should be awarded larger amounts by way of bonus, which would really be the result of the claimants entitled to the same not receiving it under certain circumstances-an event which would be purely an extraneous one and unconnected with the contribution of the respondents towards the gross profits earned by the appellant. The Tribunal was, therefore, right in calculating the bonus on an All-India basis. By our order dated April 12, 1957, the appellant was ordered to pay to the respondents within a fortnight from the date thereof bonus for the year 1954-55 equivalent to two months’ basic wages; that amount has already been paid and works out at Rs. 3.39 lacs on an All-India basis. The only question which therefore survives is what further bonus, if any, would the respondents be entitled 963 to from the distributable surplus of Rs. 12 lacs. The sum of Rs. 3.50 lacs required for building up the debenture redemption reserve is an all-engrossing need of the appellant and that is a factor which must of necessity be taken into consideration while arriving at the ultimate figure, particularly because such redemption of the debentures would enure not only for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders but also of the workmen employed therein. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, we feel that an award of four months’ basic wages as aggregate bonus for the year 1954-55 (which by the way was the bonus awarded for the previous year 1953-54 also) would give a fair share to the labour in the distributable surplus, leaving to the shareholders and the company a balance of Rs. 5.22 lacs to be utilised by them not only towards building up of the debenture redemption reserve but also for building up other reserves, which would be utilised for various other purposes indicated above. The appellant would no doubt get also the refund of the income-tax on the bonus payments made by it. This rebate would also go towards the fulfilment of the very same objectives, which would ultimately enure both for the benefit of the capital as well as labour. We have, therefore, come. to the conclusion that the appellant should pay to the respondents, in addition to the two months’ basic wages already paid to them in pursuance of this Court’s order dated April 12, 1957, an additional sum equivalent to two months’ basic wages by way of bonus for   of 11 the year 1954-55 subject to the same conditions as were laid down in the award of the Tribunal above referred to, all the dates mentioned therein being calculated from the date of this judgment. We accordingly allow the appeal, modify the award of the Industrial Tribunal to the extent mentioned above, but in the circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs, each party bearing and paying its own costs thereof.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AIYAR, J. -The petitioner is a joint Hindu family firm carrying on business at Berhampur in the State of Orissa, and registered as a dealer under the provisions of the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947, hereinafter referred to as the Act. Its business consists in the purchase of castor seeds, turmeric, gingili and other commodities locally, and selling them to demlers outside the State. The Sales Tax Officer, Berhampur, included in the taxable turnover of the petitioner the purchase of goods made by it inside the State but sold, as aforesaid, to dealers outside the State and imposed a tax of Rs. 27,161-13-0 on account of such sales during the sixteen quarters commencing from April 1, 1952, and ending with March 31, 1956. In the present application filed under Art. 32, the petitioner challenges the validity of the tax on the ground that the purchases in question were made in the course of inter-State trade, and that a tax thereon was in contravention of Art. 286(2) The impugned tax has be-en levied under s. 5 of the Act, which, omitting what is not relevant, runs as follows: 5. (1) The tax payable by a dealer under this 316 Act shall be levied at the rate of one quarter of an anna in the rupee on his taxable turnover: ................................ (2) In, this Act the expression ""taxable turnover"" means that part of a dealer’s gross turnover during any period which remains after deducting there-from: (a) his turnover during that period on ................................ (ii) sales to a registered dealer of goods specified in the purchasing dealer’s certificate of registration as being intended for resale by him in Orissa or for use by him in the execution of any contract in Orissa, and on sales to a registered dealer of contai ners or other materials for the packing of such goods: Provided that when such goods are used by the registered dealer for purposes other than those specified in his certificate of registration the price of goods so utilised shall be included in his taxable turnover. It will be seen that under this section when a sale takes place, the seller has to include it in his taxable turnover;  Page 3 of 4 but when the sale is to a registered dealer who declares that his purchases are for resale in Orissa, then it is excluded from the seller’s turn. over. If the registered dealer-purchaser sells the goods outside the State in breach of the condition, the purchases by him are liable to be included in his turnover, and assessed to sales tax. That precisely is what has happened in this case. The sales to the petitioner were not included in the taxable turnover of the sellers by reason of the registration certificate which the petitioner had obtained on a declaration that the goods were to be resold in ’Orissa. But in violation of this declaration he sold the goods to dealers outside the State, and so he became liable to be taxed under s. 5(2)(a)(ii) of the Act. The contention of the petitioner is that these purchases were made in the course of inter-State trade, and that the imposition of sales tax thereon is, in 317 consequence, ultra vires The provision applicable is Art. 286(2), as it stood prior to the sixth amendment, and it ran as follows: ""Except in so far as, Parliament may by law otherwise provide, no law of a State shall impose, or authorise the imposition of, a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce."" The argument on behalf of the petitioner is that as the goods were purchased for the purpose of being sold to dealers outside the State, and they were in fact so sold, the purchases were in the course of inter-State trade, and the levy of tax thereon was within the prohibition enacted by Art. 286(2). We do not agree with this contention. The transactions of sales which have been taxed were wholly inside the State of Orissa. They were sales by persons in the State of Orissa to persons within the State of Orissa, of goods which were in Orissa. The fact that the purchaser sold those very goods to dealers outside the State is not relevant, as those sales are distinct and separate from the sales on which the taxes in question have been imposed. The present levy is not on the sales by the petitioner to persons outside the State, but on the purchases by him inside the State. The former sales are in the course of inter-State trade, and are not taxable under Art. 286(2), but the latter are purely intrastate sales, and a tax imposed thereon does not offend Art. 286(2). In support of his, contention that the purchases are hit by Art 286(2), the petitioner relies on the, decision of this Court in Messrs. Mohanlal Hargovind Das V. The State of Madhya Pradesh (1). In that case, the petitioners who were registered dealers under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, were carrying on business in the manufacture and sale of bidis in Madhya Pradesh. For the purpose of their business, they imported processed tobaco from the State of Bombay in large quantities, rolled them into bidis and sold them to dealers in other States. (1) [1955] 2 S.C.R 509. 318 The sales tax authorities imposed a tax on the purchases made by them, on the ground that they had, in breach of the declaration in the registration certificate, sold them to merchants outside Madhya Pradesh. The contention of the petitioners was that the purchases by them were in the course of inter-State trade, and that the imposition of tax thereon was therefore repugnant to Art. 286(2). It was this  Page 4 of 4 contention that was accepted by this Court. It will be noticed that the in this case the assessment of sales tax was on very purchases from dealers in Bombay, under which the goods were transported from the State of Bombay to Madhya Pradesh. In the present case, the purchases which are sought to be assessed involved no movement of the goods outside the State of Orissa. In order that a sale or purchase might be inter-State, it is essential that there must be transport of goods from one State to another under the contract of sale or purchase. In the Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. The State of Bihar (1) occur the following observations which are apposite: ""A sale could be said to be in the course of interState trade only if two conditions concur: (1) A sale of goods and (2) a transport of those goods from one State to another under the contract of sale. Unless both those conditions are satisfied, there can be no sale in--the course of interstate trade."" With reference to the analogous provision under Art. 286(1)(b) prohibiting the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods in the course of import or export, it has been field by this Court that it is only a sale or purchase which occasions the export or import of the goods out of or into the territory of India or a sale in the State by the exporter or importer by transfer of shipping documonts, while the, goods are beyond the customs barrier, that is within the exemption, and that a sale which precedes such export or import or follows it is not exempted, vide State of Travancore. Cochin v. Shannugha Vilas Cashew Nut Factory (2). On the same principles, a purchase, made inside a State, for sale outside the State cannot itself be held (1) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603. 784-785. (2) [1954] S.C.R. 53. 319 to be in the course of inter-State trade, and the imposition of a tax thereon is not repugnant to Art. 286(2) of the Constitution. In the result this petition is dismissed with costs. Petition dismissed","JUDGMENT: ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Petition No. 12 of 1959.

In support of his, contention that the purchases are hit by Art 286(2), the petitioner relies on the, decision of this Court in Messrs. Mohanlal Hargovind Das V. The State of Madhya Pradesh (1). In that case, the petitioners who were registered dealers under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, were carrying on business in the manufacture and sale of bidis in Madhya Pradesh. For the purpose of their business, they imported processed tobaco from the State of Bombay in large quantities, rolled them into bidis and sold them to dealers in other States. (1) [1955] 2 S.C.R 509. 318 The sales tax authorities imposed a tax on the purchases made by them, on the ground that they had, in breach of the declaration in the registration certificate, sold them to merchants outside Madhya Pradesh. The contention of the petitioners was that the purchases by them were in the course of inter-State trade, and that the imposition of tax thereon was therefore repugnant to Art. 286(2). It was this  Page 4 of 4 contention that was accepted by this Court. It will be noticed that the in this case the assessment of sales tax was on very purchases from dealers in Bombay, under which the goods were transported from the State of Bombay to Madhya Pradesh. In the present case, the purchases which are sought to be assessed involved no movement of the goods outside the State of Orissa. In order that a sale or purchase might be inter-State, it is essential that there must be transport of goods from one State to another under the contract of sale or purchase. In the Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. The State of Bihar (1) occur the following observations which are apposite: ""A sale could be said to be in the course of interState trade only if two conditions concur: (1) A sale of goods and (2) a transport of those goods from one State to another under the contract of sale. Unless both those conditions are satisfied, there can be no sale in--the course of interstate trade."" With reference to the analogous provision under Art. 286(1)(b) prohibiting the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods in the course of import or export, it has been field by this Court that it is only a sale or purchase which occasions the export or import of the goods out of or into the territory of India or a sale in the State by the exporter or importer by transfer of shipping documonts, while the, goods are beyond the customs barrier, that is within the exemption, and that a sale which precedes such export or import or follows it is not exempted, vide State of Travancore. Cochin v. Shannugha Vilas Cashew Nut Factory (2). On the same principles, a purchase, made inside a State, for sale outside the State cannot itself be held (1) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603. 784-785. (2) [1954] S.C.R. 53. 319 to be in the course of inter-State trade, and the imposition of a tax thereon is not repugnant to Art. 286(2) of the Constitution. In the result this petition is dismissed with costs. Petition dismissed"

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated November 27, 1959 of the Punjab High Court (Circuit Bench) at Delhi in Civil Writ Petition No. 545-D of 1959. Purshottam Trikamdas, M. V. Goswami and B. C. Misra, for the appellant. W.S. Barlingay and R. H. Dhebar, for the respondent. March 6, 1964. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AYYANGAR, J.--There are no merits in this appeal by special leave and it deserves to be dismissed. The appellant obtained, in November 1951, an import licence from the Joint Chief Controller of Imports at Calcutta, for importing ""iron and steel bolts, nuts, set screws, machine screws and machine studs, excluding bolts, nuts and screws adapted for use on cycles"". In purported conformity with this licence the appellant imported from Japan through the Bedi port 221 cases of bolts and nuts during the period April 4, 1952 to July 14, 1952. The cases were described in the Bills of Entry which he filed as ""Stove Bolts and Nuts"" and he produced the import licence of November 1951 as his authority to clear the goods. One hundred and ninety-two of these cases were cleared out of the port customs but before the rest of the 89 cases could be cleared, the Customs authorities got suspicious that the goods were mis-described and though called ""Stove Bolts and Nuts"" in the invoices and relative documents they were really identifiable parts of bolts and nuts of the ""Jackson Type single bolt oval platebelt fasteners"" whose importation had been prohibited by a Notification of the Ministry of Trade issued in January  Page 3 of 7 1952. Their suspicions got confirmed after examination of the samples of the nuts and bolts imported and thereafter a notice was issued to the appellant to show cause why he should not be proceeded against (a) for mis-describing the 64 goods as ""stove bolts and nuts"" and (2) for importing and attempting to import goods without a proper import licence this being an offence under s. 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act. The appellant showed cause and in the written pleas which he filed, he raised two defences; (1) that the description of the goods as ""stove and nuts"" was merely a description given by the manufacturers in their invoices and he himself not being acquainted with the technical details could not be held responsible for the description given in the invoices which was copied in the Bill of Entry not being precise or exact and (2) that even if the bolts and nuts which he imported were identifiable parts of the ""single bolt belt fasteners"" whose importation was banned, there had been, on a proper construction of the import licence, read in conjunction with the Import Trade Regulations under which it was issued, no contravention since the ban on importation by the notification was confined to a complete ""Jackson type single bolt belt fastener"" and did not extend to the importation of the component parts of such a belt fastener. These two defences were examined by the Collector of Central Excise. As regards the first he found from the cor repondence exchanged between the appellant and his foreign suppliers and produced by the appellant himself in his de fence at the hearing, that the name ""stove bolts and nuts"" had been decided upon by the appellant himself after samples of the nuts and bolts which he desired to import had been received and examined by him. Practically therefore during the hearing before the Collector the appellant conceded that the name ""stove bolts and nuts"" was a misdescription of the articles which he actually imported. The next question was whether the appellant was guilty of an offence of the nature described in s. 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act. The Collector recorded a finding that the appellant was guilty of a contravention of this provision which reads: ""If any goods, the importation or exportation of which is for the time being prohibited or restricted by or under Chapter IV of this Act, be imported into or exported from India contrary to such prohibition or restriction-, or if any attempt be made so to import or export any such goods;........"" in reaching this finding the Collector was satisfied from the samples which were forwarded to the appellant and which were approved by him before finalising the indent, that the appellant was really ordering and importing nuts and bolts which were identifiable components of ""Single bolt belt fasteners"" whose importation was prohibited. He arrived 65 at this conclusion because (1) the bolts and screws imported by the appellant were those specially adapted by reason of their structure and details for use as ""single bolt belt fasteners"" and (2) these nuts and bolts could not be put to any use other than as components of a belt fastener of the type whose import was prohibited. In further support of his conclusion that the appellant really intended to evade the prohibition imposed by the Notification of January 1952 by which the importation of"" single bolt belt fasteners"" was prohibited, the Collector referred to the fact that these single bolt belt fasteners  Page 4 of 7 were composed of three components (1) a bolt (2) a nut and (3) washers. The washers to fit into the bolts and nuts imported by the appellant were found to have been separately imported by a firm called Nawanagar Industries Ltd. which was owned or controlled by close relations of the appellant. Having thus received confirmation about the real intention of the appellant to evade the prohibition contained in the Notification and thus contravene the provisions of s. 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act, the Collector imposed the penalty of confiscation of the goods and gave the owner under s. 183 of the Sea Customs Act the option to pay a fine of Rs. 5 1,000 to redeem the confiscated goods. He also imposed a personal penalty of Rs. 1,000 on the appellant under s. 167(37)(c) of the Sea Customs Act for misdescribing the goods in the Bills of Entries which he had filed. The appellant filed an appeal to the Central Board of Revenue which was dismissed. The argument before the appellant authority again was that what was prohibited was an assembled ""Jackson Type single belt oval plate belt fasteners"" but that this notification could not be read as imposing a ban on the importation of the parts of such a belt fastener though these parts may be identifiable and the parts could have no use other than as components of the article whose importation was prohibited. This submission was rejected, and appeal was dismissed. Thereafter the appellant applied to the High Court of Punjab for the issue of a writ of certiorari under Art. 226 of the Constitution and this having been dismissed in limine, moved this Court for special leave which was granted. That is how the appeal is before us. Two points were urged by Mr. Purshottam on behalf of the appellant. The first was that the appellant having been granted a licence to import ""nuts and bolts"" falling under item 22 of Part 1 of the Import Trade Control Hand-book for the relevant year, the appellant was entitled to import iron and steel bolts and nuts, whatever be the purpose they 66 served. The only limitation imposed upon the appellant by the import licence which was granted to him and which re produced the terms of Entry 22 in the Hand-book was that he could not import bolts and nuts adapted for use on cycles. The limitation thus imposed, it was urged, also indicated that if the nuts and bolts were adapted for use on articles other than on cycles they could still import them unless the importation not merely of the other article but its compo nents was also prohibited or restricted. In this connection our attention was drawn to item 28 of Part II in the same Hand-book reading ’Belting for machinery, all sorts, includ ing belt laces and belt fasteners’. The Notification dated January 12, 1952 was a clarification issued in respect of licensing policy for January-June, 1952. Dealing with serial No. 28 of Part 11 which we have extracted just now, the notification stated: ""Jackson type oval plate belt fasteners (other than single bolt). General licences will be granted freely subject to the provisions of Public Notice No. 189-ITC(PN)/51, dated the 28th December, 1951. Jackson type oval plate single bolt belt fasteners. No imports will be granted from any source."" It was not disputed that having regard to the terms of the import licence issued to the appellant the Notification as regards the prohibition against the importation of ""Jackson Oval Plate Single Bolt belt fasteners"" would apply to the appellant’s licence and these belt fasteners could not be  Page 5 of 7 imported after January 1952. For the import licence specifically stated: ""This licence is granted under Government of India, Ministry of Commerce, Notification No. 23-ITC/ 43, dated the 1 st July, 1943, and is without prejudice to the application of any other prohibition or regulation affecting the importation of the goods which may be in force at the time of their arrival."" The point, however, sought to be made was that the components of such a belt fastener could still be imported because it was said that the scheme of the Import Trade Control Hand-book was to specify wherever it was so intended ""component parts"" along with the articles of which they formed components, when a restriction or prohibition was intended to be imposed upon them also. It is, no doubt, true that in some cases component parts are specifically in cluded in some of the items in the Hand-book. It might very well be that this feature might be explained on the ground 67 of the specification being by way of abundant caution, or possibly because in them the component parts might have an independent use other than as components of the articles specified. It appears to us that it does not stand to reason that a component part which has no use other than as a component of an article whose importation is prohibited is not included in a ban or restriction as regards the importa tion of that article. Expressed in other terms. we cannot accede to the position that it is the intention of the rule that importers are permitted to do indirectly what they are forbidden to do directly, and that it permits the importation separately of components which have no use other than as components of an article whose importation is prohibited, and that an importer is thereby enabled to assemble them here as a complete article though if they were assembled beyond the Customs Frontiers the importation of the assembled article into India is prohibited. Learned Counsel, however, relied upon an unreported judgment of the Bombay High Court delivered by Mr. Justice Mudholkar when a judge of that Court, in Appeal No. 4 of 1959 (D. P. Anand v. M/s. T. M. Thakore & Co.) in support of his submission that a ban on a completed article, having regard to the phraseology employed in the Hand-book cannot be read as a restriction or prohibition of the separate importation of the component parts which when assembled result in the article whose import is prohibited. We do not read the judgment in the manner suggested by learned Counsel. The learned Judge in the judgment recorded an admission that the articles imported which were components of a motor-bicycle, would not when assembled form a complete cycle which was the article whose importation was restricted, because of the lack of certain essential parts which were admittedly not available in India and could not be imported. The next submission of the learned Counsel was that the decision of the Customs Collector was vitiated by a patent error, in that he misconstrued the scope of Entry 22 of Part 1 of the Import Trade Control Hand-book. In support of this submission the learned Counsel invited our attention to the decision of this Court in A. V. Venkateswaran Collector of Customs. Bombay v. Ramchand Sobhraj Wadhwani and Anr.(1). We see no force in this argument. The decision of this Court referred to proceeded on the basis set out on page 757 of the Report where this Court said: ""The learned Solicitor-General appearing for the appellant argued the appeal on the basis  Page 6 of 7 that the view of the learned Judges of the Bombay [1962] 1 S.C.R. 753. L/P(D)-3(a) High Court that on any reasonable interpretation of the items in the Schedule to the Tariff Act the consignment imported by the respondent could have been liable only to a duty of 30 per cent under item 45(3) was correct."" Learned Counsel cannot therefore derive any support from this decision. Besides, what we have said earlier should suffice, to show that the conclusion reached by the authority that the offence under s. 167(8) has been made out, is not incorrect. This apart, we must emphasise that a court dealing with petition under Art. 226 is not sitting in appeal over the decision of the Customs authorities and therefore the correctness of the conclusion reached by those authorities on the appreciation of the several items in the Hand-book or in the Indian Tariff Act which is referred to in these items, is not a matter which falls within the writ jurisdiction of the High Court. There is, here, no complaint of any procedural irregularity of the kind which would invalidate the order, for the order of the Collector shows by its contents that there has been an elaborate investigation and personal hearing accorded before the order now impugned was passed. Learned Counsel next submitted that the Collector of Customs had taken into consideration the importation of the washers by the Nawanagar Industries Ltd. in arriving at the conclusion that the appellant had violated s. 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act and that as in the notice that was served upon him to show cause this was not adverted to, the order adjudging confiscation was illegal and void for the reason that there had been a violation of the principles of natural justice and procedural irregularity in the hearing. We are not impressed by this argument. This submission proceeds upon a total misapprehension of the significance of the separate import of the washers by the sister concern. That import was not and could not be the subject of any charge against the appellants, and the appellants were not punished for that importation. It was merely evidence to confirm the conclusion reached by the Collector that the nuts and bolts imported were in reality the actual components of the Jack son type belt fastener whose importation was prohibited. The charge which the appellant was called on to answer did specify the nature of the offence which he was alleged to have contravened, and if evidence which the appellant could have rebutted was brought on record and considered in his presence and that evidence conclusively proved the real nature of the articles imported, there could certainly be no justifiable complaint of violation of the principles of natural justice. The misdescription of the article imported in the Bill of Entry having practically been admitted and there being 69 not much dispute that the goods imported were really com ponents of the Jackson type single belt fasteners, nothing more was needed to establish a contravention of s. 167(8). The reference therefore to the Nawanagar Industries Ltd.-which imported the washers merely confirmed the finding. In these circumstances we do not consider that there is any substance in this objection. The result is that this appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.

Thereafter, the appellant who is a voter on the rolls of the said Consti tuency filed an Election Petition before the Election Com mission on April. 11, 1962 under s. 81 of the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1951, which we shall refer to as the Act. There was no formal defect in the petition, it was accompanied by the requisite number of copies provided for by the Act and also by the treasury receipt evidencing the deposit of the requisite sum for security as provided by S. 117 of the Act. The grounds on. which the election was sought to be set aside were various and included inter alia allegations of corrupt practices against the returned candi date as well as his election agent, as also several  Page 3 of 11 irregularities in the polling by having the votes of dead voters recorded as well as by double voting. ’Me petition was received by the Commission, who after satisfying itself that it was in conformity with the Act had a copy of the petition published in the Official Cazette on May 17, 1962 as provided by s. 86 of the Act. In due course, an Election Tribunal was constituted and the petition was referred to the Tribunal for trial. The returned candidate-Brahmananda Reddy-filed 216 his Written Statement on September 15, 1962 in which the allegations of fact made in the petition were denied. Be sides what might be termed the merits of the allegations in the election petition, Brahmanda Reddy raised by his Written Statement several technical objections pointing out certain defects in the petition. This appeal is not concerned either with these technical defects in the election petition or with the defence raised on the merits to the charges that were formulated in it. The merits have yet to be tried, and as regards the technical objections to the petition raised in the Written Statement dated September 15, 1962, they have been disposed of by the High Court and the same are not before us. A few days later on September 24, 1962, Brahmananda Reddy filed a further Statement of objections to the petition raising mostly objections of a technical nature and of these the only objections which is the subject matter of the present appeal is that contained in paragraph 2 which reads, and we quote the material words: ""It is further submitted on behalf of the 1st respondent that the above petition filed u/s 81 of the Act is not an Election Petition............ As the requirements of s. 81(3) of the Act are not complied with, the petition is, therefore, liable to be dismissed u/s 90(3) of the Act as it does not comply with the provisions of sec. 81 of the Act.............. This second statement contained a prayer that in view of the technical objections, the maintainability of the petition might be decided as a preliminary issue as the objections went into the root of the matter. Paragraph (2) extracted earlier is somewhat vague but in the arguments before the Tribunal it was explained as indicating an objection alleging non-compliance with s. 81 (3) of the Act which runs: ""Every election petition shall be accompained by as many copies thereof as there are respondents. mentioned in the petition and one more copy for the use of the Election Commission, 217 and every such copy shall be attested by the petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy of the petition."" We shall refer later to the precise defect which was relied on in support of the case that there was a non-compliance with this provision. The Tribunal acceded to this request and by its order dated November 7, 1962, it decided the preliminary objections including the one just now mentioned in favour of the election petitioner and fixed a date for the trial of the petition on the merits. Brahmananda Reddy thereupon moved the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution and prayed for the issue of the Writ quashing this decision of the Tribunal and sought the dismissal of the election petition for non-compliance  Page 4 of 11 with the provisions of the Act. The learned Judges of the High Court disallowed the other technical objections raised, but held that the petition did not comply with the requirements of s. 81(3) of the Act and for this reason they, directed the dismissal of the Election Petition. Ile appellant thereafter has filed this appeal after obtaining special leave from this Court. The subject of controversy in this appeal lies in a very narrow compass. But before we deal with it, it will be convenient to specify the precise defect which the learned Judges have held to be fatal to the maintainability of the Election Petition. As stated earlier, the Election Petition filed was accompanied by the number of copies required to accompany the petition under s. 81(3). The Election Petition was type-written and the copies which accompanied the petition were carbon copies of the type-script, so there was no question of the copies being other than ’true’ copies. The copies bore two signature in original of the Election Petitioner authenticating both the contents of the petition as well as the verification thereof. The Petitioner did not however insert the words ’true copy’ before or above his signatures. The learned Judges of the High Court considered that this rendered the petition one not in accordance with s. 81(3) of the Act and it is on this ground that the Election, Petition filed by the appellant has been dismissed and it is the correctness of this decision that is convassed in the appeal before us. In view of the arguments addressed to us it would be necessary to set out a few of the relevant provisions of the, Act which bear upon the points urged, but before doing so we shall refer to Art. 329 of the Constitution which pro vides: ""................ 329(b) no election to either House of Parliament or to the House or either House of the Legislature of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law made by the appropriate Legislature."" In accordance with this. we have the provisions of the Act and, particularly those contained in Part VI commencing with s. 79. Section 80 repeats the provision in the Constitution already extracted and enacts : ""No election shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part."" Section 81 deals with the presentation of petitions. It runs: ""81. Presentation of petitions. (1) An election petition calling in question any election may be presented on one or more of the grounds specified in sub-section (i) of section 100 and section 101 to the Election Commission by any candidate at such election or any elector within forty-five days from, but not earlier than, the date of election of the returned candidate, or if there are more than one returned candidate at the election and the dates of their election are different, the later of those two dates. 219 Explanation. In this sub-section, ’elector’ means a person who was entitled to vote at the  Page 5 of 11 election to which the election petition relates, whether he has voted at such election or not. (2) An election petition shall be deemed to have been presented to the Election. Commission: (a) when it is delivered to the Secretary to the Commission or to such other officer as may be appointed by the Election Commission in this behalf (i) by the person making the petition, or (ii)by a person authorised in writing in this behalf by the person making the petition; or (b) when it is sent by registered post and is deli vered to the Secretary to the Commission or the officer so appointed. (3) Every election petition shall be accompanied by as many copies thereof as there are respondents mentioned in the petition and one more copy for the use of the Election Commission, and, every such copy shall be attested by the petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy of the petition."" Before, proceeding further it is necessary to advert to the history of the provision in sub-section (3) for learned counsel for the respondents laid some store by the object with which the provision was introduced. As enacted in 1951, s. 81 contained only two sub-sections, the first deal ing with the time within which a petition had to be filed and the second with the person or authority and the manner in which the petition had to be presented in order to cons titute the presentation one to the Election Commission. At that date the Election Commission, after scrutinizing the petitions to ascertain whether there were any formal defects, had itself to make copies for being served on the respondents. To avoid this trouble and inconvenience to the Commission and the delay which the making of such copies 220 necessarily involved, sub-section (3) which we have set out earlier was introduced into s. 81 by an amendment affected by Act XL of 1961. The point made, based on this feature, we shall reserve for later discussion. Section 82 deals with the parties who are to be impleaded in the petition and s. 83 with the contents of the petition. section 83(1)(c) enacts: ""An election petition shall be signed by the petitioner and verified in the manner laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, for the verification of pleadings."" subsection (2) requires a similar signature and verification of schedules or annexures to the petition. Section 85 empowers the Election Commission to dismiss a petition in certain contingencies. It reads: ""85. If the provisions of section 81 or section 82 or section 117 have not been complied with, the Election Commissi on shall dismiss the petition: Provided that the petition shall not be dismissed without giving the petitioner an opportunity of being heard."" The succeeding sections deal with the trial of Election Petitions, after making provision for the appointment of an  Page 6 of 11 Election Tribunal by s. 86 but what is relevant in the pre sent context is s. 90 and it is enough to quote the material words: (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any rules made thereunder, every election petition shall be tried by the Tribunal, as nearly as may be, in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, to the trial of suits: Sub-section (3) reads: The Tribunal shall dismiss an election petition which does not comply with the provisions of 221 section 81, notwithstanding that it has not been dismissed by the Election Commission under s. 85."" The reasoning on which the learned Judges have based their decision shortly stated is this. It is the requirement of s. 81(3) of the Act that an election petition should be accompanied by the number of copies specified there, and equally so that the copies so accompanying ""shall be attest ed by the petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy of the petition"". There was, of course, the signature of the petitioner on the copies, but there was no attestation by him that ""it was a true copy"". This constituted a noncompliance with the requirements of s. 81 which brought into play the terms of s. 90(3) of the Act which required the Tribunal to dismiss a petition which did not comply with the provisions of s. 81. Though the learned counsel for the appellant made several submissions, we propose to deal with only one, as the same is sufficient for the disposal of this appeal. This was that in the circumstances of the case there had been a sub stantial compliance with the requirements of s. 81(3). Before, however, dealing with it, it will be convenient to refer to some of the submissions made to us by the learned Solicitor-General appearing for the contesting respondents. ’He submitted to us certain propositions which however we consider really unexceptionable. He said that an election petition was not to be equated to an action at law or in equity, but that as the rights were purely the creature of statute, if the statute rendered any particular requirement mandatory, the courts possessed and could exercise no dis pensing power to waive non-compliance. We consider these propositions are sound and it is in the light of these basic positions that we shall proceed to consider whether the ,omission to add the words ""true copy"" in the copies which were admittedly exact copies of the petition, constituted a non-compliance with s. 81 (3) as to render the petition liable to be rejected under s. 90(3) of the Act. Learned counsel for the appellant urged that the juris diction of the Tribunal under s. 90(3) to dismiss ’an ele 222 tion petition which does not comply with the provisions of s. 81’ was attracted only if there was a defect in the peti tion itself and that a defect merely in the copy accompanying the petition would not be a case of a ""petition not complying with the provisions of s. 81"" so as to require or even permit the Tribunal to dismiss the petition. In support of this submission, the difference in the language employed in s. 85 and s. 90(3) of the Act in the matter of making reference to the requirements of s. 81 was adverted to. Besides, it was pointed out that both s. 90(3) and before it s. 90(4) were in their present form making refer  Page 7 of 11 ence to s. 81 when the latter section did not contain the third sub-section relating to copies accompanying the petition, and that the content of s. 90(3) should not be held enlarged because in 1961 sub-section (3) was added to s. 81 particularly because the language of s. 90(3) was not altered to reflect the change. We are not impressed by this argument. When s. 81 (3) requires an election petition to be accompanied by the requisite number of copies, it became a requirement for the presentation of the election petition to the Commission, and therefore a condition precedent for the proper presentation of an election petition. If that is a requirement of s. 81, no distinction can be drawn between the requirements of sub sections (1) and (2) and of sub-section (3). We might add that if there is a total and complete non-compliance with the provisions of s. 81(3), the election petition might not be ""an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part"" within s. 80 of the Act. We are therefore inclined to consider that if there had been such a non-compliance with the requirement of sub-section (3) not merely the Election Commission under s. 85 but the Election Tribunal under s. 90(3) would prima facie not merely be justified but would be required ’to ’dismiss the election petition. This takes us to the point as to whether the requirement of s. 81(3) has been complied with or not. The principal submission of the learned Solicitor-General was based the language employed in s. 81(3) of the Act read in 223 the light of the direction contained in s. 90(3) which cast on the Tribunal the duty to dismiss an election petition which did not conform to the requirements of the former. In particular, he laid stress on the use of the imperative ’shall in s. 81(3) when denoting the requirement of ""attes tation"" ""under the petitioner’s signature"" of the copy bearing the signature being a ""true copy"". It was in this connection that he pointed out that the provision for properly attested copies of the petition accompanying the petition was introduced by the amendment effected in 1961, and the object of Parliament was two-fold; first to save the time and inconvenience which the previous procedure cast on the Election Commission, of itself having to make copies for service on the respondents, and secondly by this means to expedite the conclusion of the trial of an election petition. He submitted that the attainment of these objects would be entirely frustrated if the respondents on whom these copies were served had still to make enquiries to satisfy themselves whether the copies were true copies, without the same being asserted to be so on their face. In support he referred us to the decisions in Noseworthy v. Overseers of Buckland etc. (1) and in Spice v. Bacon (2 ) as illustrating the degree of strictness and literal compliance which was insisted on by courts in regard to provisions of like character. The first of these cases was a registration appeal and the Act provided that a person who objected to a voter’s quali fication might be heard in support of his objection if he had given notice to the voter and the manner of giving notice was by sending it by post addressed to his place of abode ""as described"". It was held that a notice by post addressed correctly but not to the address ""as described"" was not a compliance with ’the requirement and that in consequence the objector could not be heard. We do not consider that this decision lays down any hard and fast rule or principle of construction which is attracted ’to every  Page 8 of 11 case where a statute calls for interpretation. In ultimate analysis the question is one of the construction of the relevant provision of the particular statutes which proceeds on the basis. of the words used understood in the context of the statute. (1) L.R. 9 C. P. 233. (2) L.R. a Ex. D. 463. 224 The second case raised a question as to the meaning of the word ""true copy"" in the Inn-keepers’ Liability Act 1863, which required that in order to obtain the benefit of the limitation of liability conferred by the Act, a ""copy"" of the Act had to be exhibited at the Inn. The copy which was exhibited omitted some material words of the section which was required to be exhibited. The Court held that when a claim was made on the inn-keeper for loss sustained by a guest, he could not claim the benefit of the statute. We are unable to appreciate the relevance of this decision. It turned on what was meant by the word ’copy’ in the Act and the portion which was omitted in the copy exhibited was a material portion. There is no doubt that such a ’copy’ which differs in material particular from the original is not a ‘copy’ within the Act. In this connection we might make a reference to the decision of this Court in Murarka v. Roop Singh(1) where the question as to what is a ""copy"" is elaborately discussed and some of the English decisions touching this matter have been set out. We shall have occasion to refer to Murarka’s case later, but for the present we need only add that the decision relied on by the Solicitor-General is not at variance with what this Court has laid down in Murarka’s case. The next matter to be considered stems from the submission as regards the object of Parliament in enacting sub-section (3) of s. 81 and that expeditious disposal of election petitions which was the object would be frustrated if sub stantial compliance with the provision was held sufficient. We are not impressed with this argument. While we are conscious of the need for expeditious disposal of election petitions, and for the strict enforcement of provisions designed to achieve this purpose, we cannot be oblivious to the circumstance that to read every requirement literally might equally defeat the purpose for which Part VI is inten ded, viz., that elections are conducted in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions framed to ensure purity and orderliness and that the candidate who has not obtained a majority of valid votes or has obtained it in flagrant (1) [1964] 3 S.C.R. 573 225 breach of the statutory provisions in not held entitled to represent the constituency. The Court had to deal with a similar question of inter pretation of words which appeared mandatory in Kamaraj Nadar v. Kunju Thevar(1). One of the points which arose for consideration was whether the requirement of s. 117 of the Act which then required the petitioner to enclose with the petition a Government treasury receipt of Rs. 100 in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission had been complied with by the election petitioner and s. 90(4) of the Act which corresponded substantially to the present s. 90(3) required the Election Tribunal to dismiss a petition which did not comply with the provision, inter alia, of s. 117. The petitioner in that case had made the deposit of the requisite amount in the institutions named in the section but the deposit was made in favour of the Election Commission and not in favour of the Secretary to the Com  Page 9 of 11 mission as required by statute. It was contended that the petition did not conform to the provisions of s. 117 and had therefore to be dismissed by the Tribunal. This Court rejected this submission and after adverting to the purpose of the provisions, held that this was fulfilled by the deposit made and that though the requirement as to deposit was mandatory, the same was complied with by the deposit made. We consider that this reasoning is not irrelevant to the construction of s. 81(3) of the Act either. In this connection we might refer to the decision of this Court in Murarka v. Roop Singh (2) in which this Court had to consider a question closely related to that now under debate. That case was also concerned with certain defects similar to what we have in the appeal before us. The defects which were there relied on by the returned candidate as justifying or requiring the dismissal of the Election Petition fell into several categories which included non compliance with the requirements of s. 81(3). There, as here, the petition was accompanied with the re (1)[1959] S.C.R. 583. (2) [1964] 3 S.C.R. 573. 134--159 S.C--15 226 quisite number of copies as specified in s. 81(3) but what was urged was as regards certain defects in the copies filed. These defects fell into two types. First there were two matters which it was stated rendered the copies filed not ’true copies’. If the expressions ’copy’ or ’true copy’ were read as exact copies of the original, the copies filed did not satisfy that test. The two defects were: (1) The original petition contained the signature of the petitioner at the foot of the petition as required by s. 83 (1) (c) of the Act. In the copy filed there was no copy of this signature. To that extent therefore the copy was not an exact copy. The second matter under this head was that the verification in the copy served on the appellant did not exactly correspond to that in the original in that in the latter one of the paragraphs was stated to be true to the personal knowledge of the petitioner while in the former that paragraph was omitted from this group. The other type of defect which was claimed to constitute noncompliance with s. 81(3) was that the words ’true copy’ with the signature of the petitioner underneath were not put down in one of the annexures to the petition, copies of which were annexed to the copies of the petition filed. The order of the Returning Officer rejecting the nomination paper of the petitioner was filed with the original petition as an annexure to it, and certified copies of that order were annexed to the copies of the petition. But this certified copy did not contain an endorsement stating that it was a ’true copy’ with the signature of the petitioner. The High Court had held that so far as the defect in not reproducing the signature in the petition was concerned, it was cured by the fact that every page of the copy of the petition was attested to be a true copy and therefore it would not matter if the last page did not contain the signature. As regards the second, the High Court held that the failure to include the paragraph in the verification was only a clerical defect which had crept in through oversight and as regards the other that it was no defect at all. This decision was upheld by this Court holding that the word copy in s. 81(3) meant a copy which was substantially so and which did not 227   11 contain any material or substantial variation. By ’copy’ in s. 81(3) was meant not an exact copy but only one so true that nobody by any possibility misunderstands it not being the same as the original. Applying this test, this .Court came to the conclusion that there was no failure to comply with the last part of s. 81(3), with the result that s. 90(3) of the Act was not attracted. This Court besides left open the question as to whether any part of s. 81(3) was directory or whether any portion of it was mandatory. In the present case also, we do not propose to deal with the larger question as to whether s. 81(3) or any portion of it is merely directory. In view of the decision of this Court it would be clear that if there is a substantial compliance with the requirement of s. 81(3), the election petition cannot be dismissed by the Tribunal under s. 90(3). The question then is whether on the facts above-stated, there is or is not a sufficient and substantial compliance with s. 81(3). We have already pointed out that the appellant has complied with the following requirements: (1) The petition has been accompanied by the requisite number of copies. (2) The copies that accompanied the petition were true copies. (3) Each of those copies bore the signatures of the petitioner. If the signature of the petitioner whose name is set out in the body of the petition is appended at the end, surely it authenticates the contents of the document. Now in regard to this the learned Judges of the High Court themselves ob served after referring to the terms of s. 81(3): ""No doubt, what is necessary is a substantial compliance with the requirement of attestation. For instance, if it is proved that the election petitioner has signed animo attestendi, and omitted the words ’true copy’ by mistake or inadvertently, there is a substantial requirement of the compliance of s. 81(3). The 228 same may be said if the relative positions of the words ’true copy’ and of the signature one below the other are not correct."" They however held that as there was no evidence of the sig nature having been appended animo attestendi, there was non compliance with s. 81(3). The learned Solicitor-General while not disputing the correctness of the observations of the learned Judges just extracted pressed upon us that the signature at the end of the copy was meant only as a copy of that in the original petition and could not satisfy the requirement as to attestation of the copy. He also submitted that the position would have been different if there were two signatures instead of one at the end of the copy, even if the words ’true copy’ were omitted to be put down. In that case, he said, one signature could be treated as representing the copy of the signature on the original and the other might be taken to have been made animo attestendi. We do not however consider that there is really need for so much refinement when one has to look at whether there is a substantial compliance with s. 81(3), seeing that a signature in origisignatures now found on the copies were intended to authenticate the document to which it is appended, viz., the copy, it would only mean that the copy did not reproduce the signature in the original. There is no compelling necessity to hold that the signatures were   of 11 merely intended to be a copy of those on the original in order to spell out a noncompliance with the requirement of this provision. If the nal was not needed on the copy and a writing copying out the name of the signatory would suffice. The decision of this Court in Murarka’s case(1) is authority for the position that the absence of a writing in the copy indicating the signature in the original would not detract the copy from being a true copy. In the circumstances, we consider that there has been substantial compliance with the requirement of s. 81(3) in the petition that was filed by the appellant and the learned Judges were in error in directing the dismissal of the petition. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the order of the High Court dismissing the petition is set aside. As owing (1)[1964] 3 S. R. 573 229 to the filing of the Writ Petition there has been a considerable delay in the trial of the Election Petition, we express the hope that the petition would be heard and disposed of at an early a date as is conveniently possible. The appellant will be entitled to his costs here and in the High Court which will be paid by the contesting third respondent. Appeal Allowed","JUDGMENT: CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 971 of 1963. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated April 15, 1963 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Writ Petition No. 1096 of 1962. P.A. Chaudhury and T. V. R. Tatachari, for the appellant. 215 H.N. Sanyal, Solicitor-General and P. Ram Reddy, for respondent No. 3. January 13, 1964. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AYYANGAR J.-This is an appeal by special leave against a judgment of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh by which a Writ Petition filed by the 3rd Respondent-K. Brahmananda Reddy was allowed and an Election Petition filed by the appellant was directed to be dismissed. The facts giving rise to the proceedings with which the appeal is concerned are briefly as follows: At the General Elections held in the month of February 1962 for the Legis lative Assembly-Constituency of Phirangipuram in Guntur District in Andhra Pradesh-the third respondent Brahamananda Reddy and one Chandramouli, the 2nd respondent before us, were the contesting candidates. The polling at the Election took place on the 26th February 1962 and the Returning Officer declared Brahmananda Reddy, elected as having obtained, the majority of valid votes. Thereafter, the appellant who is a voter on the rolls of the said Consti tuency filed an Election Petition before the Election Com mission on April. 11, 1962 under s. 81 of the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1951, which we shall refer to as the Act. There was no formal defect in the petition, it was accompanied by the requisite number of copies provided for by the Act and also by the treasury receipt evidencing the deposit of the requisite sum for security as provided by S. 117 of the Act. The grounds on. which the election was sought to be set aside were various and included inter alia allegations of corrupt practices against the returned candi date as well as his election agent, as also several  Page 3 of 11 irregularities in the polling by having the votes of dead voters recorded as well as by double voting. ’Me petition was received by the Commission, who after satisfying itself that it was in conformity with the Act had a copy of the petition published in the Official Cazette on May 17, 1962 as provided by s. 86 of the Act. In due course, an Election Tribunal was constituted and the petition was referred to the Tribunal for trial. The returned candidate-Brahmananda Reddy-filed 216 his Written Statement on September 15, 1962 in which the allegations of fact made in the petition were denied. Be sides what might be termed the merits of the allegations in the election petition, Brahmanda Reddy raised by his Written Statement several technical objections pointing out certain defects in the petition. This appeal is not concerned either with these technical defects in the election petition or with the defence raised on the merits to the charges that were formulated in it. The merits have yet to be tried, and as regards the technical objections to the petition raised in the Written Statement dated September 15, 1962, they have been disposed of by the High Court and the same are not before us. A few days later on September 24, 1962, Brahmananda Reddy filed a further Statement of objections to the petition raising mostly objections of a technical nature and of these the only objections which is the subject matter of the present appeal is that contained in paragraph 2 which reads, and we quote the material words: ""It is further submitted on behalf of the 1st respondent that the above petition filed u/s 81 of the Act is not an Election Petition............ As the requirements of s. 81(3) of the Act are not complied with, the petition is, therefore, liable to be dismissed u/s 90(3) of the Act as it does not comply with the provisions of sec. 81 of the Act.............. This second statement contained a prayer that in view of the technical objections, the maintainability of the petition might be decided as a preliminary issue as the objections went into the root of the matter. Paragraph (2) extracted earlier is somewhat vague but in the arguments before the Tribunal it was explained as indicating an objection alleging non-compliance with s. 81 (3) of the Act which runs: ""Every election petition shall be accompained by as many copies thereof as there are respondents. mentioned in the petition and one more copy for the use of the Election Commission, 217 and every such copy shall be attested by the petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy of the petition."" We shall refer later to the precise defect which was relied on in support of the case that there was a non-compliance with this provision. The Tribunal acceded to this request and by its order dated November 7, 1962, it decided the preliminary objections including the one just now mentioned in favour of the election petitioner and fixed a date for the trial of the petition on the merits. Brahmananda Reddy thereupon moved the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution and prayed for the issue of the Writ quashing this decision of the Tribunal and sought the dismissal of the election petition for non-compliance  Page 4 of 11 with the provisions of the Act. The learned Judges of the High Court disallowed the other technical objections raised, but held that the petition did not comply with the requirements of s. 81(3) of the Act and for this reason they, directed the dismissal of the Election Petition. Ile appellant thereafter has filed this appeal after obtaining special leave from this Court. The subject of controversy in this appeal lies in a very narrow compass. But before we deal with it, it will be convenient to specify the precise defect which the learned Judges have held to be fatal to the maintainability of the Election Petition. As stated earlier, the Election Petition filed was accompanied by the number of copies required to accompany the petition under s. 81(3). The Election Petition was type-written and the copies which accompanied the petition were carbon copies of the type-script, so there was no question of the copies being other than ’true’ copies. The copies bore two signature in original of the Election Petitioner authenticating both the contents of the petition as well as the verification thereof. The Petitioner did not however insert the words ’true copy’ before or above his signatures. The learned Judges of the High Court considered that this rendered the petition one not in accordance with s. 81(3) of the Act and it is on this ground that the Election, Petition filed by the appellant has been dismissed and it is the correctness of this decision that is convassed in the appeal before us. In view of the arguments addressed to us it would be necessary to set out a few of the relevant provisions of the, Act which bear upon the points urged, but before doing so we shall refer to Art. 329 of the Constitution which pro vides: ""................ 329(b) no election to either House of Parliament or to the House or either House of the Legislature of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law made by the appropriate Legislature."" In accordance with this. we have the provisions of the Act and, particularly those contained in Part VI commencing with s. 79. Section 80 repeats the provision in the Constitution already extracted and enacts : ""No election shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part."" Section 81 deals with the presentation of petitions. It runs: ""81. Presentation of petitions. (1) An election petition calling in question any election may be presented on one or more of the grounds specified in sub-section (i) of section 100 and section 101 to the Election Commission by any candidate at such election or any elector within forty-five days from, but not earlier than, the date of election of the returned candidate, or if there are more than one returned candidate at the election and the dates of their election are different, the later of those two dates. 219 Explanation. In this sub-section, ’elector’ means a person who was entitled to vote at the  Page 5 of 11 election to which the election petition relates, whether he has voted at such election or not. (2) An election petition shall be deemed to have been presented to the Election. Commission: (a) when it is delivered to the Secretary to the Commission or to such other officer as may be appointed by the Election Commission in this behalf (i) by the person making the petition, or (ii)by a person authorised in writing in this behalf by the person making the petition; or (b) when it is sent by registered post and is deli vered to the Secretary to the Commission or the officer so appointed. (3) Every election petition shall be accompanied by as many copies thereof as there are respondents mentioned in the petition and one more copy for the use of the Election Commission, and, every such copy shall be attested by the petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy of the petition."" Before, proceeding further it is necessary to advert to the history of the provision in sub-section (3) for learned counsel for the respondents laid some store by the object with which the provision was introduced. As enacted in 1951, s. 81 contained only two sub-sections, the first deal ing with the time within which a petition had to be filed and the second with the person or authority and the manner in which the petition had to be presented in order to cons titute the presentation one to the Election Commission. At that date the Election Commission, after scrutinizing the petitions to ascertain whether there were any formal defects, had itself to make copies for being served on the respondents. To avoid this trouble and inconvenience to the Commission and the delay which the making of such copies 220 necessarily involved, sub-section (3) which we have set out earlier was introduced into s. 81 by an amendment affected by Act XL of 1961. The point made, based on this feature, we shall reserve for later discussion. Section 82 deals with the parties who are to be impleaded in the petition and s. 83 with the contents of the petition. section 83(1)(c) enacts: ""An election petition shall be signed by the petitioner and verified in the manner laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, for the verification of pleadings."" subsection (2) requires a similar signature and verification of schedules or annexures to the petition. Section 85 empowers the Election Commission to dismiss a petition in certain contingencies. It reads: ""85. If the provisions of section 81 or section 82 or section 117 have not been complied with, the Election Commissi on shall dismiss the petition: Provided that the petition shall not be dismissed without giving the petitioner an opportunity of being heard."" The succeeding sections deal with the trial of Election Petitions, after making provision for the appointment of an  Page 6 of 11 Election Tribunal by s. 86 but what is relevant in the pre sent context is s. 90 and it is enough to quote the material words: (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any rules made thereunder, every election petition shall be tried by the Tribunal, as nearly as may be, in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, to the trial of suits: Sub-section (3) reads: The Tribunal shall dismiss an election petition which does not comply with the provisions of 221 section 81, notwithstanding that it has not been dismissed by the Election Commission under s. 85."" The reasoning on which the learned Judges have based their decision shortly stated is this. It is the requirement of s. 81(3) of the Act that an election petition should be accompanied by the number of copies specified there, and equally so that the copies so accompanying ""shall be attest ed by the petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy of the petition"". There was, of course, the signature of the petitioner on the copies, but there was no attestation by him that ""it was a true copy"". This constituted a noncompliance with the requirements of s. 81 which brought into play the terms of s. 90(3) of the Act which required the Tribunal to dismiss a petition which did not comply with the provisions of s. 81. Though the learned counsel for the appellant made several submissions, we propose to deal with only one, as the same is sufficient for the disposal of this appeal. This was that in the circumstances of the case there had been a sub stantial compliance with the requirements of s. 81(3). Before, however, dealing with it, it will be convenient to refer to some of the submissions made to us by the learned Solicitor-General appearing for the contesting respondents. ’He submitted to us certain propositions which however we consider really unexceptionable. He said that an election petition was not to be equated to an action at law or in equity, but that as the rights were purely the creature of statute, if the statute rendered any particular requirement mandatory, the courts possessed and could exercise no dis pensing power to waive non-compliance. We consider these propositions are sound and it is in the light of these basic positions that we shall proceed to consider whether the ,omission to add the words ""true copy"" in the copies which were admittedly exact copies of the petition, constituted a non-compliance with s. 81 (3) as to render the petition liable to be rejected under s. 90(3) of the Act. Learned counsel for the appellant urged that the juris diction of the Tribunal under s. 90(3) to dismiss ’an ele 222 tion petition which does not comply with the provisions of s. 81’ was attracted only if there was a defect in the peti tion itself and that a defect merely in the copy accompanying the petition would not be a case of a ""petition not complying with the provisions of s. 81"" so as to require or even permit the Tribunal to dismiss the petition. In support of this submission, the difference in the language employed in s. 85 and s. 90(3) of the Act in the matter of making reference to the requirements of s. 81 was adverted to. Besides, it was pointed out that both s. 90(3) and before it s. 90(4) were in their present form making refer  Page 7 of 11 ence to s. 81 when the latter section did not contain the third sub-section relating to copies accompanying the petition, and that the content of s. 90(3) should not be held enlarged because in 1961 sub-section (3) was added to s. 81 particularly because the language of s. 90(3) was not altered to reflect the change. We are not impressed by this argument. When s. 81 (3) requires an election petition to be accompanied by the requisite number of copies, it became a requirement for the presentation of the election petition to the Commission, and therefore a condition precedent for the proper presentation of an election petition. If that is a requirement of s. 81, no distinction can be drawn between the requirements of sub sections (1) and (2) and of sub-section (3). We might add that if there is a total and complete non-compliance with the provisions of s. 81(3), the election petition might not be ""an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part"" within s. 80 of the Act. We are therefore inclined to consider that if there had been such a non-compliance with the requirement of sub-section (3) not merely the Election Commission under s. 85 but the Election Tribunal under s. 90(3) would prima facie not merely be justified but would be required ’to ’dismiss the election petition. This takes us to the point as to whether the requirement of s. 81(3) has been complied with or not. The principal submission of the learned Solicitor-General was based the language employed in s. 81(3) of the Act read in 223 the light of the direction contained in s. 90(3) which cast on the Tribunal the duty to dismiss an election petition which did not conform to the requirements of the former. In particular, he laid stress on the use of the imperative ’shall in s. 81(3) when denoting the requirement of ""attes tation"" ""under the petitioner’s signature"" of the copy bearing the signature being a ""true copy"". It was in this connection that he pointed out that the provision for properly attested copies of the petition accompanying the petition was introduced by the amendment effected in 1961, and the object of Parliament was two-fold; first to save the time and inconvenience which the previous procedure cast on the Election Commission, of itself having to make copies for service on the respondents, and secondly by this means to expedite the conclusion of the trial of an election petition. He submitted that the attainment of these objects would be entirely frustrated if the respondents on whom these copies were served had still to make enquiries to satisfy themselves whether the copies were true copies, without the same being asserted to be so on their face. In support he referred us to the decisions in Noseworthy v. Overseers of Buckland etc. (1) and in Spice v. Bacon (2 ) as illustrating the degree of strictness and literal compliance which was insisted on by courts in regard to provisions of like character. The first of these cases was a registration appeal and the Act provided that a person who objected to a voter’s quali fication might be heard in support of his objection if he had given notice to the voter and the manner of giving notice was by sending it by post addressed to his place of abode ""as described"". It was held that a notice by post addressed correctly but not to the address ""as described"" was not a compliance with ’the requirement and that in consequence the objector could not be heard. We do not consider that this decision lays down any hard and fast rule or principle of construction which is attracted ’to every  Page 8 of 11 case where a statute calls for interpretation. In ultimate analysis the question is one of the construction of the relevant provision of the particular statutes which proceeds on the basis. of the words used understood in the context of the statute. (1) L.R. 9 C. P. 233. (2) L.R. a Ex. D. 463. 224 The second case raised a question as to the meaning of the word ""true copy"" in the Inn-keepers’ Liability Act 1863, which required that in order to obtain the benefit of the limitation of liability conferred by the Act, a ""copy"" of the Act had to be exhibited at the Inn. The copy which was exhibited omitted some material words of the section which was required to be exhibited. The Court held that when a claim was made on the inn-keeper for loss sustained by a guest, he could not claim the benefit of the statute. We are unable to appreciate the relevance of this decision. It turned on what was meant by the word ’copy’ in the Act and the portion which was omitted in the copy exhibited was a material portion. There is no doubt that such a ’copy’ which differs in material particular from the original is not a ‘copy’ within the Act. In this connection we might make a reference to the decision of this Court in Murarka v. Roop Singh(1) where the question as to what is a ""copy"" is elaborately discussed and some of the English decisions touching this matter have been set out. We shall have occasion to refer to Murarka’s case later, but for the present we need only add that the decision relied on by the Solicitor-General is not at variance with what this Court has laid down in Murarka’s case. The next matter to be considered stems from the submission as regards the object of Parliament in enacting sub-section (3) of s. 81 and that expeditious disposal of election petitions which was the object would be frustrated if sub stantial compliance with the provision was held sufficient. We are not impressed with this argument. While we are conscious of the need for expeditious disposal of election petitions, and for the strict enforcement of provisions designed to achieve this purpose, we cannot be oblivious to the circumstance that to read every requirement literally might equally defeat the purpose for which Part VI is inten ded, viz., that elections are conducted in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions framed to ensure purity and orderliness and that the candidate who has not obtained a majority of valid votes or has obtained it in flagrant (1) [1964] 3 S.C.R. 573 225 breach of the statutory provisions in not held entitled to represent the constituency. The Court had to deal with a similar question of inter pretation of words which appeared mandatory in Kamaraj Nadar v. Kunju Thevar(1). One of the points which arose for consideration was whether the requirement of s. 117 of the Act which then required the petitioner to enclose with the petition a Government treasury receipt of Rs. 100 in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission had been complied with by the election petitioner and s. 90(4) of the Act which corresponded substantially to the present s. 90(3) required the Election Tribunal to dismiss a petition which did not comply with the provision, inter alia, of s. 117. The petitioner in that case had made the deposit of the requisite amount in the institutions named in the section but the deposit was made in favour of the Election Commission and not in favour of the Secretary to the Com  Page 9 of 11 mission as required by statute. It was contended that the petition did not conform to the provisions of s. 117 and had therefore to be dismissed by the Tribunal. This Court rejected this submission and after adverting to the purpose of the provisions, held that this was fulfilled by the deposit made and that though the requirement as to deposit was mandatory, the same was complied with by the deposit made. We consider that this reasoning is not irrelevant to the construction of s. 81(3) of the Act either. In this connection we might refer to the decision of this Court in Murarka v. Roop Singh (2) in which this Court had to consider a question closely related to that now under debate. That case was also concerned with certain defects similar to what we have in the appeal before us. The defects which were there relied on by the returned candidate as justifying or requiring the dismissal of the Election Petition fell into several categories which included non compliance with the requirements of s. 81(3). There, as here, the petition was accompanied with the re (1)[1959] S.C.R. 583. (2) [1964] 3 S.C.R. 573. 134--159 S.C--15 226 quisite number of copies as specified in s. 81(3) but what was urged was as regards certain defects in the copies filed. These defects fell into two types. First there were two matters which it was stated rendered the copies filed not ’true copies’. If the expressions ’copy’ or ’true copy’ were read as exact copies of the original, the copies filed did not satisfy that test. The two defects were: (1) The original petition contained the signature of the petitioner at the foot of the petition as required by s. 83 (1) (c) of the Act. In the copy filed there was no copy of this signature. To that extent therefore the copy was not an exact copy. The second matter under this head was that the verification in the copy served on the appellant did not exactly correspond to that in the original in that in the latter one of the paragraphs was stated to be true to the personal knowledge of the petitioner while in the former that paragraph was omitted from this group. The other type of defect which was claimed to constitute noncompliance with s. 81(3) was that the words ’true copy’ with the signature of the petitioner underneath were not put down in one of the annexures to the petition, copies of which were annexed to the copies of the petition filed. The order of the Returning Officer rejecting the nomination paper of the petitioner was filed with the original petition as an annexure to it, and certified copies of that order were annexed to the copies of the petition. But this certified copy did not contain an endorsement stating that it was a ’true copy’ with the signature of the petitioner. The High Court had held that so far as the defect in not reproducing the signature in the petition was concerned, it was cured by the fact that every page of the copy of the petition was attested to be a true copy and therefore it would not matter if the last page did not contain the signature. As regards the second, the High Court held that the failure to include the paragraph in the verification was only a clerical defect which had crept in through oversight and as regards the other that it was no defect at all. This decision was upheld by this Court holding that the word copy in s. 81(3) meant a copy which was substantially so and which did not 227   11 contain any material or substantial variation. By ’copy’ in s. 81(3) was meant not an exact copy but only one so true that nobody by any possibility misunderstands it not being the same as the original. Applying this test, this .Court came to the conclusion that there was no failure to comply with the last part of s. 81(3), with the result that s. 90(3) of the Act was not attracted. This Court besides left open the question as to whether any part of s. 81(3) was directory or whether any portion of it was mandatory. In the present case also, we do not propose to deal with the larger question as to whether s. 81(3) or any portion of it is merely directory. In view of the decision of this Court it would be clear that if there is a substantial compliance with the requirement of s. 81(3), the election petition cannot be dismissed by the Tribunal under s. 90(3). The question then is whether on the facts above-stated, there is or is not a sufficient and substantial compliance with s. 81(3). We have already pointed out that the appellant has complied with the following requirements: (1) The petition has been accompanied by the requisite number of copies. (2) The copies that accompanied the petition were true copies. (3) Each of those copies bore the signatures of the petitioner. If the signature of the petitioner whose name is set out in the body of the petition is appended at the end, surely it authenticates the contents of the document. Now in regard to this the learned Judges of the High Court themselves ob served after referring to the terms of s. 81(3): ""No doubt, what is necessary is a substantial compliance with the requirement of attestation. For instance, if it is proved that the election petitioner has signed animo attestendi, and omitted the words ’true copy’ by mistake or inadvertently, there is a substantial requirement of the compliance of s. 81(3). The 228 same may be said if the relative positions of the words ’true copy’ and of the signature one below the other are not correct."" They however held that as there was no evidence of the sig nature having been appended animo attestendi, there was non compliance with s. 81(3). The learned Solicitor-General while not disputing the correctness of the observations of the learned Judges just extracted pressed upon us that the signature at the end of the copy was meant only as a copy of that in the original petition and could not satisfy the requirement as to attestation of the copy. He also submitted that the position would have been different if there were two signatures instead of one at the end of the copy, even if the words ’true copy’ were omitted to be put down. In that case, he said, one signature could be treated as representing the copy of the signature on the original and the other might be taken to have been made animo attestendi. We do not however consider that there is really need for so much refinement when one has to look at whether there is a substantial compliance with s. 81(3), seeing that a signature in origisignatures now found on the copies were intended to authenticate the document to which it is appended, viz., the copy, it would only mean that the copy did not reproduce the signature in the original. There is no compelling necessity to hold that the signatures were   of 11 merely intended to be a copy of those on the original in order to spell out a noncompliance with the requirement of this provision. If the nal was not needed on the copy and a writing copying out the name of the signatory would suffice. The decision of this Court in Murarka’s case(1) is authority for the position that the absence of a writing in the copy indicating the signature in the original would not detract the copy from being a true copy. In the circumstances, we consider that there has been substantial compliance with the requirement of s. 81(3) in the petition that was filed by the appellant and the learned Judges were in error in directing the dismissal of the petition. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the order of the High Court dismissing the petition is set aside. As owing (1)[1964] 3 S. R. 573 229 to the filing of the Writ Petition there has been a considerable delay in the trial of the Election Petition, we express the hope that the petition would be heard and disposed of at an early a date as is conveniently possible. The appellant will be entitled to his costs here and in the High Court which will be paid by the contesting third respondent. Appeal Allowed"

The Judgment of WANCHOO, C.J., SHAH, BACHAWAT, MITTER and HEGDE, JJ. was delivered by WANCHOO, C.J., HIDAYATULLAH, J. delivered a separate Opinion. Wanchoo, C.J. These twenty-one petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution for a writ of habeas corpus raise common questions of law and will be dealt with together. It is enough to set out the facts in one of the petitions (No. 142 of 1967), for the facts in other petitions are almost similar. The petitioner was arrested on November 11, 1966 and detained under an order passed under r. 30(1)(b) of the  Page 4 of 11 Defence of India Rules, 1962 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules). It appears that though the order was reviewed after the period of six months, no opportunity was given to the petitioner to represent his case before the reviewing authority. In consequence the detention of the petitioner be came illegal after the first period of six months in view of the judgment of this Court in P.L. Lakhanpal v. Union of India(1). The State Government realising this defect, cancelled the order dated November 11, 1966 on August 3, 196’7, and on the same day a fresh order of detention was passed and it is this order which (1) A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 1507: [1967] 3 S.C.R. 114. L 1O Sup CI/67--17 230 is being challenged before us. It is not in dispute that in view of the judgment of this Court in Jadev Singh v. State of Jammu and Kashmir(1), it was open to the State Government, in view of the formal defect in making the review, to pass a fresh order of detention after revoking the earlier order, which in any case became ineffective after the first six months, if the circumstances which led to the detention originally still continued. The main attack of the petitioners is on the order of the President passed on November 3, 1962, as amended on November 11, 1962, under Art. 359(1) of the Constitution. By this order the President declared that the right to move any court for ’the enforcement of the fundamental rights conferred by Arts. 14, 21 and 22 of the Constitution would remain suspended for the period during which the Proclamation of Emergency issued under Art. 352(1), was in force, if any person was deprived of such right under the Defence of India Ordinance (No. 4 of 1962) or any rule or order made thereunder. The argument in support is put this way. The President is an ""authority"" within the meaning of Art. 12 and therefore is comprised within the definition of the word ""State"" and the order passed under Art. 359 is a law within the meaning of Art. 13(2) of the Constitution. Consequently an order passed by the President under Art. 359 is liable to be tested on the anvil of the fundamental rights enshrined in Part Ill of the Constitution: Secondly, it is urged that an order passed under Art. 359 is made in the context of the Emergency and therefore enforcement of only such fundamental rights can be suspended which have nexus with the reasons which led to the Proclamation of Emergency. In consequence, the President can only suspend the enforcement of fundamental rights under Art. 22 and Art. 31 (2) under an order passed under Art. 359 and no others. Thirdly, it is urged that even if the President can suspend the enforcement of any fundamental right, the order passed can still be tested under the very fundamental right enforcement of which has been suspended. Fourthly, it is urged that an order passed under Art. 359 can in any case be challenged under Art. 14, and if so the order passed in the present case is violative of Art. 14 because some persons can be detained under the Defence of India Act, 51 of 1962 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and the Rules while others can be detained under the Preventive Detention Act. As the Act and the Rules give more drastic powers for detention as compared to the powers conferred by the Preventive Detention Act, there is discrimination, for there is no indication as to when detention should be made under the Act and the Rules and when under the prevention law, and the matter is left to the arbitrary discretion of the executive. Fifthly, it is urged that in view of the language of the order under Art. 359, there should have been  Page 5 of 11 an [1968] 1 S.C.R. 197. 231 express provision in the Act and the Rules to the effect that enforcement of fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 21 and 22 was suspended and in the absence of such an express provision, the Presidential order under Art. 359 cannot stand in the way of the detention order being tested under Part III of the Constitution. Sixthly, it is urged that Art. 22 (5 ) provides that grounds of detention should be furnished to a detenu and the order of the President did not do away with the necessity of furnishing the grounds. Besides these main contentions, three subsidiary contentions have also been raised in one petition or another and they are-(1) that the fresh order had not been communicated to the detenues and was therefore of no avail; (ii) that the order was not in the form as required by Art. 166 of the Constitution and it is therefore for the State Government to prove that it was passed by the authority which had the power to do so; and (iii) that the fresh order was mala fide. The petitions have been opposed on behalf of the State Government. It is unnecessary to set out in detail the contentions in reply to the main points raised on behalf of the petitioners. It is enough to say that the contention on behalf of the State is that once the President has passed an order under Art. 359 suspending the enforcement of any fundamental right, it is not open to rely on that fundamental right for any purpose, so long as the order under Art. 359 stands and such an order cannot be tested in any manner by the very fundamental right the enforcement of which it has suspended. Further as to the subsidiary points, the State contends that the fresh order of detention was communicated to each detenu and that the order was in the form required by the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and that Art. 166 has no application to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. It was finally denied that the order was mala fide in any of the cases. Part XVIII deals with Emergency Provisions and begins with Art. 352 which provides for making a declaration that ""a grave emergency exists whereby the security of India or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened, whether by war or external aggression or internal disturbance"", if the President is so satisfied. Arts. 353 and 354 provide for the effect of the Proclamation of Emergency; but it is unnecessary to refer to them for present purposes. Article 358 lays down that during the period that a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, Article 19 shall remain suspended, Article 359 with which we are particularly concerned lays down that where a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, the President may by order declare that the right to move any court for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in the order and all proceedings pending in any court for the enforcement of the rights so mentioned shall remain L10Sup. C1/67--18 232 suspended for the period during which the Proclamation is in force or for such shorter period as may be specified in the order."" The order made under Art. 359 may extend to whole or any part of the territory of India and has to be laid, as soon as may be after it is made, before each House of Parliament. It will be seen from the terms or Art. 359 that it gives categorical powers to the President during the period  Page 6 of 11 when a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation to suspend the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III. It is for the President to decide the enforcement of which of the fundamental rights should be suspended during the operation of the Proclamation of Emergency.There is nothing in Art. 359 which in any way limits the power of the President to suspend. the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III.It is to our mind quite clear that the President has the power to suspend the enforcement of. any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III and there is nothing thereunder which makes any distinction between one fundamental right or another. As Art. 359 stands, it seems to us, it clearly envisages that once a Proclamation of Emergency has been issued, the security of India or any part of the territory thereof may require that the President should suspend the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III. There is in our opinion no scope for inquiry into the question whether the fundamental right the enforcement of which the President has suspended under Art. 359 has anything to do with the security of India which is threatened whether by war or external aggression or internal disturbance, for Art. 359 posits that it may be necessary for the President to suspend any of the fundamental rights in Part HI for the sake of the security of India. There is thus a basic assumption in Art. 359 that it may be necessary for the President to suspend the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III in the interest of the security of India. If he considers that necessary, it is unnecessary in the face of that basic assumption to inquire whether enforcement of a particular fundamental right suspended by the President has anything to do with the security of India, for that is implicit in Art. 359. It follows therefore that it is open to the President to suspend the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III by an order under Art. 359 and this Article shows that wherever such suspension is made it is in the interest of the security of India and no further proof of it is necessary. This brings us to the main ground’ raised on behalf of the petitioner that an order under Art. 359 is a law made by the State within the meaning of Art. 13(2) and has therefore to be 233 tested under Part III of the Constitution. We may assume for present purposes that the President is comprised within the word ""State"" in Art. 12. We may also assume that the order made by the President under Art. 359 is a law in its widest sense. The question however is whether such an order can be considered to be a law for the purpose of Art. 13(2) and tested thereunder. Article 13(2) and Art. 359 being parts of the same Constitution stand on an equal footing and the two provisions have to be read harmoniously in order that the intention behind Art. 359 is carried out and it is not destroyed altogether by Art. 13(2). It follows that though an order under Art. 359 may be assumed to be law in its widest sense, it cannot be law within the meaning of Art. 13(2), for if that were so, Art. 359 would be made nugatory. The Constitution through Art. 359 says that the President may suspend the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights in Part III where a Proclamation of Emergency is in force and that means that during the period of Emergency the fundamental rights, enforcement of which is suspended, cannot be enforced. If the order is a law within the meaning of Art. 13(2), the result would be that though  Page 7 of 11 the order says that the enforcement of a particular fundamental right is suspended during the period of Emergency the order can still be tested with the aid of Art. 13(2) on the anvil of the same fundamental right, the enforcement of which it suspends. That would in our opinion result in making Art. ’359 completely nugatory, for then a declaration made there under that the enforcement of certain fundamental rights is suspended during the period of Emergency would have no meaning whatsoever.’ Therefore, applying the principle of harmonious construction we are of opinion that an order passed under Art. 359. cannot be law for the purpose of Art. 13(2), assuming it to be law in its widest sense. It follows therefore that an order under Art. 359 derives its force from Art. 359 itself and takes effect in accordance with its tenor and cannot be affected by Art.. 13 (2), and cannot be tested under any of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution which it suspends. Reliance in this connection is placed on the judgment of this Court in Ghulam Sarwar v. Union of India(1), where the majority made a distinction between the President’s order itself under Art. 359 and the effect of that order. In that case it was observed that ""there is a clear distinction between deprivation of fundamental rights by force of a constitutional provision itself and such deprivation by an order made by the President in exercise of a power conferred on him under a constitutional provision."" It was further observed. that ""Article 359(1) does not operate by its own force. The President has to make an order declaring that the right to move a court in respect of a fundamental right (1) [1967] 2 S.C.R. 271. 234 or rights in Part III is suspended. He can only make an order which is a valid one."" It was further observed that an order making an unjustified discrimination in suspending the right to move a court under Art. 14, would be void at its inception and would be a still born order. We must say with greatest respect that it is rather difficult to understand how an order under Art. 359 which suspends the enforcement of a fundamental right can be tested under that very fundamental right. It is true that there is a distinction between Art. 358 and Art 359(1). Article 358 by its own force suspends the fundamental rights guaranteed by Art. 19; Art. 359(1) on the other hand does not suspend any fundamental right of its own force but it gives power to the President to suspend the enforcement of any fundamental right during the period of Emergency. But that cannot mean that an order passed under Art. 359(1 ) suspending the enforcement of a particular fundamental right has still to be tested under the very fundamental right which it suspends. That would in our opinion be arguing in a circle and make Art 359 completely nugatory. It seems that the majority in Ghulam Sarwar’s(1) case was also conscious of the fact that the reasoning on which it came to the conclusion that an order made under Art. 359 could be tested under Art. 14. though it suspended that Article, was open to the criticism that it was an argument in a circle. The argument was however met by making a distinction between the order and the effect of that order and it was observed that if the order did not violate Art. 14 it could validly ’take away ,the right to enforce the fundamental right under Art. 14. With greatest respect it is difficult to appreciate this reasoning and the distinction on which it is based. It seems to us that if Art. 359 is to have any meaning at all and is not to be wiped out from the  Page 8 of 11 Constitution an order passed thereunder suspending a fundamental right cannot possibly be tested under’ that very fundamental right which it suspends. If that were permissible no order under Art. 359 could really be passed. If Art. 359 is not to be rendered nugatory, it must be held that an order passed thereunder cannot be tested under the very fundamental right the enforcement of which it suspends. We must therefore respectfully differ from the view taken in Ghulam Sarwar’s case(1) and hold that an order passed under Art. 359(1) cannot be tested with the aid of Art. 13(2) under that very fundamental right the enforcement of which it suspends. There is therefore no force in the first point raised on behalf of the petitioners. We ,also see no force in the second point raised by the petitioners. As we have already indicated Art. 359 envisages that an (1) [1967] 2 S.C.R. 271. 235 order passed thereunder for suspension of the enforcement of particular fundamental right is for the sake of security of India It is therefore not necessary to enquire whether there is any nexus between a particular fundamental right suspended and the security of India. Article 359 itself posits that it may be necessary in the interest of the security of India to pass an order suspending the enforcement of any fundamental right thereunder. This is clear from the fact that Art. 359(1), provides for the suspension of the enforcement of the fundamental rights in Part III of the Constitution only during the period of Emergency meaning thereby that suspension of the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights which the President considers necessary is for the security of India. We fail to see why only fundamental rights under Art. 22 or under Art. 31(2) can be suspended under Art. 359; Article 359 clearly shows that any fundamental right in Part Ill can be suspended during an Emergency and we cannot limit Article 359 in the face of the unambiguous and express words thereof and say that only the enforcement of fundamental right under Articles 22 and 31(2) can be suspended. It may be that prima facie these two fundamental rights appear to have a clearer nexus with security of India; but it does not follow that other fundamental fights may not in an Emergency have such a nexus. In any case Art. 359 itself proceeds on the basis that the suspension of the enforcement of all or any of the fundamental rights is for the sake of security of India and so gives the power to the President to suspend such enforcement if he considers it necessary for that purpose. The second contention raised on behalf of the petitioners must also be rejected. As to the third contention, we have already indicated that an order passed under Art. 359(1) suspending the enforcement of a particular fundamental right cannot be tested under that very fundamental right. We cannot see how if the order under Art- 359 suspends Art. 14 its validity can still be tested under that very Article. We have already expressed our respectful dissent from the view taken in Ghulam Sarwar’s case(1) and must reject this contention. As the enforcement of the fundamental right under Art. 14 was suspended by the President’s order under Art. 359, no question of that order being bad under that Article can arise even if we assume that the provisions for detention under the Act and the Rules are more stringent than the provisions for detention under the Preventive Detention Act. The fourth contention also fails. As to the fifth contention it is urged that on. the  Page 9 of 11 words of the order passed by the President suspending the enforcement of fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 21 and 22, there had to be a 236 provision in the Act and the Rules expressly to the effect that these fundamental rights would not be enforceable. We cannot understand how any provision could have been made in the Act and Rules to this effect. Such a provision in the Act 43r the Rules would be clearly unconstitutional. It is only because Art. 359(1)provides that the President may suspend the enforcement of a particular fundamental right that it is possible for the enforcement of any fundamental right to be suspended during the Emergency.What the President has provided in the present case is that the enforcement of fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 21 and 22 would be suspended if any person has been deprived of such right under the Defence’ of India Ordinance (later replaced by the Act) or the Rules or orders made thereunder. It is necessary to emphasis that the President’s order speaks of suspension under the Ordinance (later replaced by the Act) or the Rules or orders made thereunder. It does not say that the enforcement of such right is suspended if any person is deprived of it by the Ordinance the Rules or orders made thereunder. Therefore it was not necessary that there should be any express provision in the Act or the Rules suspending the enforcement of fundamental rights under Arts. 14,21 and 22. The clear intendment of the President’s order is that if any fundamental right of any person under Arts. 14, 21 and 22 was invaded by any action taken under the Ordinance (later replaced by the Act), or any rule or order thereunder, that action could not be tested on the anvil of those fundamental rights. It was therefore not necessary to make any express provision in the Act or the Rules for the suspension of the enforcement of the fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 21 and 22. The fifth contention must also fail. The sixth contention is that Art. 22(5) which lays down that grounds of detention must be communicated to the person detained must still be applicable. We have not been able to understand this argument at all. If the President’s order is validly made-as we hold it to be-and if it suspends Art. 22--as it does--we fail to see how clause (5 ) continues, for it is only a part of Art. 22 which has been suspended. There is no question therefore of furnishing any ground under Art. 22(5) to the detenu if the detention is under the Act on the Rules, for the entire Art. 22 has been suspended. The argument under this head is also rejected. This brings us to the subsidiary points raised on behalf of the petitioners. It is first said that the fresh order was not communicated to the detenues. This has been denied on behalf of the State. We see no reason why the fresh order which was passed on the same day on which the earlier order was cancelled would not have been communicated. Nothing has been shown to us to disbelieve the statement on behalf of the State that the fresh order was 237 communicated in each case and. therefore any argument based on its not being communicated must fail. Then it is argued that the order is not in the form as required by Art. 166. It is enough to say that Art. 166 does not apply to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. We have to look to the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir to see whether the form of the order is in accordance therewith. It is clear that the order is in the form required by s. 45 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. The presumption   11 must therefore be-made that it was passed validly unless the petitioners can show that it was not passed as required by law. No attempt has been made on behalf of the petitioners to show that. The contention on this head must therefore also be rejected. Lastly, it is urged that the orders in these cases were mala fide. This has been denied on behalf of the State. No grounds have been shown which may lead us to the conclusion that the fresh orders which were passed were mala fide. The necessity for fresh orders arose because the review was not made in accordance with the manner indicated by this Court in Lakhanpal’s case(1). The fresh order that was made was on the same facts and must in the circumstances be held to be valid in view of the judgment of this Court in Jagdev Singh’s case(2). The petitions therefore fail and are hereby dismissed. Hidayatullah, J. I agree that the petitions be dismissed. As I was a member of the Constitution Bench which decided Ghulam Sarwar’s(2) case I wish to say a few words in explanation. The judgment of Subba Rao, C.J. to which I was a party has expressed itself somewhat unhappily on ,the point on which it has been overruled in the judgment just delivered. The former Chief Justice upheld the extension of G.S.R. 1418/30-10-62 (which suspended the benefits of Arts. 21 and 22 to a foreigner) by G.S.R. 1275/27-8-3965. The latter order suspended Art. 14 in addition to the two articles already suspended. This ’suspension was upheld on the ground that there was a clear classification between citizens and foreigners and in a state of war and emergency foreigners could be treated as a class. In other words, the order was tested on the ground of Art. 14 itself which the order of the President sought to suspend. In the judgment just delivered it has been said that the reasoning in Ghulam Sarwar’s(3) case is difficult to understand and that the suspension of Art. 14 precludes examination of the order under that article. I should have thought that I had sufficiently explained my position during the discussion of the draft judgment (1) A.I.R. (1967) S.C. 1507: [1967] 3 S.C.R. 114 (2) [1968] 1 S.C.R. 197. (3) [1967] 2 S.C.R. 271. 238 in Ghulam Sarwar’s(1) case but it appears that in spite of my doubts about the width of language in that judgment, the decision to which I became a party continued to bear the meaning now attributed to it. If I may say with, great respect, the judgment just delivered also suffers from a width of language in the other direction. The truth lies midway. Although a suspension of a fundamental right under Art. 359(1) may be made either for the whole of India or any part of the territory of India, Ghulam Sarwar’s(1) case points out that there is nothing to prevent the President from restricting the scope of the order to a class of persons provided the operation of the order is confined to an area and to a period. As the order was applicable to the whole of India and for the duration of the emergency although it affected a class, namely, foreigners, it was upheld. This was not the application of Art. 14. This was said because the argument was that the order could only be with reference to the whole or a part of the territory of India and not with respect to a class such as foreigners. That meant that the Order was considered in relation to the words of Art. 359(1). Room was, however, to be left for the   of 11 play of Art. 14 for those theoretically possible (and fortunately ’only theoretically possible) cases in which the exercise of the power itself may be a cloak for discrimination, in other words, cases of mala fide action and clear abuse of the power for some collateral purpose. This strict reservation only was intended to go into the judgment in Ghulam Sarwar’s(1) case but if a wider meaning can be spelled out from that judgment I dissent from it and say that I never intended to ’be a party to such a wide statement. The examination under Art. 14 of the suspension of the article itself, as expressed in the judgment of Subba Rao C.J. gives a very different impression. For the same reason I cannot subscribe to the width of language in the judgment just delivered which apparently ’does not make any reservation at all. Therefore I agree to the order proposed but reserve my reasons. R.K.P.S. Petitions dismissed.

The Judgment of WANCHOO, C.J., SHAH, BACHAWAT, MITTER and HEGDE, JJ. was delivered by WANCHOO, C.J., HIDAYATULLAH, J. delivered a separate Opinion. Wanchoo, C.J. These twenty-one petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution for a writ of habeas corpus raise common questions of law and will be dealt with together. It is enough to set out the facts in one of the petitions (No. 142 of 1967), for the facts in other petitions are almost similar. The petitioner was arrested on November 11, 1966 and detained under an order passed under r. 30(1)(b) of the  Page 4 of 11 Defence of India Rules, 1962 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules). It appears that though the order was reviewed after the period of six months, no opportunity was given to the petitioner to represent his case before the reviewing authority. In consequence the detention of the petitioner be came illegal after the first period of six months in view of the judgment of this Court in P.L. Lakhanpal v. Union of India(1). The State Government realising this defect, cancelled the order dated November 11, 1966 on August 3, 196’7, and on the same day a fresh order of detention was passed and it is this order which (1) A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 1507: [1967] 3 S.C.R. 114. L 1O Sup CI/67--17 230 is being challenged before us. It is not in dispute that in view of the judgment of this Court in Jadev Singh v. State of Jammu and Kashmir(1), it was open to the State Government, in view of the formal defect in making the review, to pass a fresh order of detention after revoking the earlier order, which in any case became ineffective after the first six months, if the circumstances which led to the detention originally still continued. The main attack of the petitioners is on the order of the President passed on November 3, 1962, as amended on November 11, 1962, under Art. 359(1) of the Constitution. By this order the President declared that the right to move any court for ’the enforcement of the fundamental rights conferred by Arts. 14, 21 and 22 of the Constitution would remain suspended for the period during which the Proclamation of Emergency issued under Art. 352(1), was in force, if any person was deprived of such right under the Defence of India Ordinance (No. 4 of 1962) or any rule or order made thereunder. The argument in support is put this way. The President is an ""authority"" within the meaning of Art. 12 and therefore is comprised within the definition of the word ""State"" and the order passed under Art. 359 is a law within the meaning of Art. 13(2) of the Constitution. Consequently an order passed by the President under Art. 359 is liable to be tested on the anvil of the fundamental rights enshrined in Part Ill of the Constitution: Secondly, it is urged that an order passed under Art. 359 is made in the context of the Emergency and therefore enforcement of only such fundamental rights can be suspended which have nexus with the reasons which led to the Proclamation of Emergency. In consequence, the President can only suspend the enforcement of fundamental rights under Art. 22 and Art. 31 (2) under an order passed under Art. 359 and no others. Thirdly, it is urged that even if the President can suspend the enforcement of any fundamental right, the order passed can still be tested under the very fundamental right enforcement of which has been suspended. Fourthly, it is urged that an order passed under Art. 359 can in any case be challenged under Art. 14, and if so the order passed in the present case is violative of Art. 14 because some persons can be detained under the Defence of India Act, 51 of 1962 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and the Rules while others can be detained under the Preventive Detention Act. As the Act and the Rules give more drastic powers for detention as compared to the powers conferred by the Preventive Detention Act, there is discrimination, for there is no indication as to when detention should be made under the Act and the Rules and when under the prevention law, and the matter is left to the arbitrary discretion of the executive. Fifthly, it is urged that in view of the language of the order under Art. 359, there should have been  Page 5 of 11 an [1968] 1 S.C.R. 197. 231 express provision in the Act and the Rules to the effect that enforcement of fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 21 and 22 was suspended and in the absence of such an express provision, the Presidential order under Art. 359 cannot stand in the way of the detention order being tested under Part III of the Constitution. Sixthly, it is urged that Art. 22 (5 ) provides that grounds of detention should be furnished to a detenu and the order of the President did not do away with the necessity of furnishing the grounds. Besides these main contentions, three subsidiary contentions have also been raised in one petition or another and they are-(1) that the fresh order had not been communicated to the detenues and was therefore of no avail; (ii) that the order was not in the form as required by Art. 166 of the Constitution and it is therefore for the State Government to prove that it was passed by the authority which had the power to do so; and (iii) that the fresh order was mala fide. The petitions have been opposed on behalf of the State Government. It is unnecessary to set out in detail the contentions in reply to the main points raised on behalf of the petitioners. It is enough to say that the contention on behalf of the State is that once the President has passed an order under Art. 359 suspending the enforcement of any fundamental right, it is not open to rely on that fundamental right for any purpose, so long as the order under Art. 359 stands and such an order cannot be tested in any manner by the very fundamental right the enforcement of which it has suspended. Further as to the subsidiary points, the State contends that the fresh order of detention was communicated to each detenu and that the order was in the form required by the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and that Art. 166 has no application to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. It was finally denied that the order was mala fide in any of the cases. Part XVIII deals with Emergency Provisions and begins with Art. 352 which provides for making a declaration that ""a grave emergency exists whereby the security of India or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened, whether by war or external aggression or internal disturbance"", if the President is so satisfied. Arts. 353 and 354 provide for the effect of the Proclamation of Emergency; but it is unnecessary to refer to them for present purposes. Article 358 lays down that during the period that a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, Article 19 shall remain suspended, Article 359 with which we are particularly concerned lays down that where a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, the President may by order declare that the right to move any court for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in the order and all proceedings pending in any court for the enforcement of the rights so mentioned shall remain L10Sup. C1/67--18 232 suspended for the period during which the Proclamation is in force or for such shorter period as may be specified in the order."" The order made under Art. 359 may extend to whole or any part of the territory of India and has to be laid, as soon as may be after it is made, before each House of Parliament. It will be seen from the terms or Art. 359 that it gives categorical powers to the President during the period  Page 6 of 11 when a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation to suspend the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III. It is for the President to decide the enforcement of which of the fundamental rights should be suspended during the operation of the Proclamation of Emergency.There is nothing in Art. 359 which in any way limits the power of the President to suspend. the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III.It is to our mind quite clear that the President has the power to suspend the enforcement of. any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III and there is nothing thereunder which makes any distinction between one fundamental right or another. As Art. 359 stands, it seems to us, it clearly envisages that once a Proclamation of Emergency has been issued, the security of India or any part of the territory thereof may require that the President should suspend the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III. There is in our opinion no scope for inquiry into the question whether the fundamental right the enforcement of which the President has suspended under Art. 359 has anything to do with the security of India which is threatened whether by war or external aggression or internal disturbance, for Art. 359 posits that it may be necessary for the President to suspend any of the fundamental rights in Part HI for the sake of the security of India. There is thus a basic assumption in Art. 359 that it may be necessary for the President to suspend the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III in the interest of the security of India. If he considers that necessary, it is unnecessary in the face of that basic assumption to inquire whether enforcement of a particular fundamental right suspended by the President has anything to do with the security of India, for that is implicit in Art. 359. It follows therefore that it is open to the President to suspend the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III by an order under Art. 359 and this Article shows that wherever such suspension is made it is in the interest of the security of India and no further proof of it is necessary. This brings us to the main ground’ raised on behalf of the petitioner that an order under Art. 359 is a law made by the State within the meaning of Art. 13(2) and has therefore to be 233 tested under Part III of the Constitution. We may assume for present purposes that the President is comprised within the word ""State"" in Art. 12. We may also assume that the order made by the President under Art. 359 is a law in its widest sense. The question however is whether such an order can be considered to be a law for the purpose of Art. 13(2) and tested thereunder. Article 13(2) and Art. 359 being parts of the same Constitution stand on an equal footing and the two provisions have to be read harmoniously in order that the intention behind Art. 359 is carried out and it is not destroyed altogether by Art. 13(2). It follows that though an order under Art. 359 may be assumed to be law in its widest sense, it cannot be law within the meaning of Art. 13(2), for if that were so, Art. 359 would be made nugatory. The Constitution through Art. 359 says that the President may suspend the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights in Part III where a Proclamation of Emergency is in force and that means that during the period of Emergency the fundamental rights, enforcement of which is suspended, cannot be enforced. If the order is a law within the meaning of Art. 13(2), the result would be that though  Page 7 of 11 the order says that the enforcement of a particular fundamental right is suspended during the period of Emergency the order can still be tested with the aid of Art. 13(2) on the anvil of the same fundamental right, the enforcement of which it suspends. That would in our opinion result in making Art. ’359 completely nugatory, for then a declaration made there under that the enforcement of certain fundamental rights is suspended during the period of Emergency would have no meaning whatsoever.’ Therefore, applying the principle of harmonious construction we are of opinion that an order passed under Art. 359. cannot be law for the purpose of Art. 13(2), assuming it to be law in its widest sense. It follows therefore that an order under Art. 359 derives its force from Art. 359 itself and takes effect in accordance with its tenor and cannot be affected by Art.. 13 (2), and cannot be tested under any of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution which it suspends. Reliance in this connection is placed on the judgment of this Court in Ghulam Sarwar v. Union of India(1), where the majority made a distinction between the President’s order itself under Art. 359 and the effect of that order. In that case it was observed that ""there is a clear distinction between deprivation of fundamental rights by force of a constitutional provision itself and such deprivation by an order made by the President in exercise of a power conferred on him under a constitutional provision."" It was further observed. that ""Article 359(1) does not operate by its own force. The President has to make an order declaring that the right to move a court in respect of a fundamental right (1) [1967] 2 S.C.R. 271. 234 or rights in Part III is suspended. He can only make an order which is a valid one."" It was further observed that an order making an unjustified discrimination in suspending the right to move a court under Art. 14, would be void at its inception and would be a still born order. We must say with greatest respect that it is rather difficult to understand how an order under Art. 359 which suspends the enforcement of a fundamental right can be tested under that very fundamental right. It is true that there is a distinction between Art. 358 and Art 359(1). Article 358 by its own force suspends the fundamental rights guaranteed by Art. 19; Art. 359(1) on the other hand does not suspend any fundamental right of its own force but it gives power to the President to suspend the enforcement of any fundamental right during the period of Emergency. But that cannot mean that an order passed under Art. 359(1 ) suspending the enforcement of a particular fundamental right has still to be tested under the very fundamental right which it suspends. That would in our opinion be arguing in a circle and make Art 359 completely nugatory. It seems that the majority in Ghulam Sarwar’s(1) case was also conscious of the fact that the reasoning on which it came to the conclusion that an order made under Art. 359 could be tested under Art. 14. though it suspended that Article, was open to the criticism that it was an argument in a circle. The argument was however met by making a distinction between the order and the effect of that order and it was observed that if the order did not violate Art. 14 it could validly ’take away ,the right to enforce the fundamental right under Art. 14. With greatest respect it is difficult to appreciate this reasoning and the distinction on which it is based. It seems to us that if Art. 359 is to have any meaning at all and is not to be wiped out from the  Page 8 of 11 Constitution an order passed thereunder suspending a fundamental right cannot possibly be tested under’ that very fundamental right which it suspends. If that were permissible no order under Art. 359 could really be passed. If Art. 359 is not to be rendered nugatory, it must be held that an order passed thereunder cannot be tested under the very fundamental right the enforcement of which it suspends. We must therefore respectfully differ from the view taken in Ghulam Sarwar’s case(1) and hold that an order passed under Art. 359(1) cannot be tested with the aid of Art. 13(2) under that very fundamental right the enforcement of which it suspends. There is therefore no force in the first point raised on behalf of the petitioners. We ,also see no force in the second point raised by the petitioners. As we have already indicated Art. 359 envisages that an (1) [1967] 2 S.C.R. 271. 235 order passed thereunder for suspension of the enforcement of particular fundamental right is for the sake of security of India It is therefore not necessary to enquire whether there is any nexus between a particular fundamental right suspended and the security of India. Article 359 itself posits that it may be necessary in the interest of the security of India to pass an order suspending the enforcement of any fundamental right thereunder. This is clear from the fact that Art. 359(1), provides for the suspension of the enforcement of the fundamental rights in Part III of the Constitution only during the period of Emergency meaning thereby that suspension of the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights which the President considers necessary is for the security of India. We fail to see why only fundamental rights under Art. 22 or under Art. 31(2) can be suspended under Art. 359; Article 359 clearly shows that any fundamental right in Part Ill can be suspended during an Emergency and we cannot limit Article 359 in the face of the unambiguous and express words thereof and say that only the enforcement of fundamental right under Articles 22 and 31(2) can be suspended. It may be that prima facie these two fundamental rights appear to have a clearer nexus with security of India; but it does not follow that other fundamental fights may not in an Emergency have such a nexus. In any case Art. 359 itself proceeds on the basis that the suspension of the enforcement of all or any of the fundamental rights is for the sake of security of India and so gives the power to the President to suspend such enforcement if he considers it necessary for that purpose. The second contention raised on behalf of the petitioners must also be rejected. As to the third contention, we have already indicated that an order passed under Art. 359(1) suspending the enforcement of a particular fundamental right cannot be tested under that very fundamental right. We cannot see how if the order under Art- 359 suspends Art. 14 its validity can still be tested under that very Article. We have already expressed our respectful dissent from the view taken in Ghulam Sarwar’s case(1) and must reject this contention. As the enforcement of the fundamental right under Art. 14 was suspended by the President’s order under Art. 359, no question of that order being bad under that Article can arise even if we assume that the provisions for detention under the Act and the Rules are more stringent than the provisions for detention under the Preventive Detention Act. The fourth contention also fails. As to the fifth contention it is urged that on. the  Page 9 of 11 words of the order passed by the President suspending the enforcement of fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 21 and 22, there had to be a 236 provision in the Act and the Rules expressly to the effect that these fundamental rights would not be enforceable. We cannot understand how any provision could have been made in the Act and Rules to this effect. Such a provision in the Act 43r the Rules would be clearly unconstitutional. It is only because Art. 359(1)provides that the President may suspend the enforcement of a particular fundamental right that it is possible for the enforcement of any fundamental right to be suspended during the Emergency.What the President has provided in the present case is that the enforcement of fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 21 and 22 would be suspended if any person has been deprived of such right under the Defence’ of India Ordinance (later replaced by the Act) or the Rules or orders made thereunder. It is necessary to emphasis that the President’s order speaks of suspension under the Ordinance (later replaced by the Act) or the Rules or orders made thereunder. It does not say that the enforcement of such right is suspended if any person is deprived of it by the Ordinance the Rules or orders made thereunder. Therefore it was not necessary that there should be any express provision in the Act or the Rules suspending the enforcement of fundamental rights under Arts. 14,21 and 22. The clear intendment of the President’s order is that if any fundamental right of any person under Arts. 14, 21 and 22 was invaded by any action taken under the Ordinance (later replaced by the Act), or any rule or order thereunder, that action could not be tested on the anvil of those fundamental rights. It was therefore not necessary to make any express provision in the Act or the Rules for the suspension of the enforcement of the fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 21 and 22. The fifth contention must also fail. The sixth contention is that Art. 22(5) which lays down that grounds of detention must be communicated to the person detained must still be applicable. We have not been able to understand this argument at all. If the President’s order is validly made-as we hold it to be-and if it suspends Art. 22--as it does--we fail to see how clause (5 ) continues, for it is only a part of Art. 22 which has been suspended. There is no question therefore of furnishing any ground under Art. 22(5) to the detenu if the detention is under the Act on the Rules, for the entire Art. 22 has been suspended. The argument under this head is also rejected. This brings us to the subsidiary points raised on behalf of the petitioners. It is first said that the fresh order was not communicated to the detenues. This has been denied on behalf of the State. We see no reason why the fresh order which was passed on the same day on which the earlier order was cancelled would not have been communicated. Nothing has been shown to us to disbelieve the statement on behalf of the State that the fresh order was 237 communicated in each case and. therefore any argument based on its not being communicated must fail. Then it is argued that the order is not in the form as required by Art. 166. It is enough to say that Art. 166 does not apply to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. We have to look to the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir to see whether the form of the order is in accordance therewith. It is clear that the order is in the form required by s. 45 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. The presumption   11 must therefore be-made that it was passed validly unless the petitioners can show that it was not passed as required by law. No attempt has been made on behalf of the petitioners to show that. The contention on this head must therefore also be rejected. Lastly, it is urged that the orders in these cases were mala fide. This has been denied on behalf of the State. No grounds have been shown which may lead us to the conclusion that the fresh orders which were passed were mala fide. The necessity for fresh orders arose because the review was not made in accordance with the manner indicated by this Court in Lakhanpal’s case(1). The fresh order that was made was on the same facts and must in the circumstances be held to be valid in view of the judgment of this Court in Jagdev Singh’s case(2). The petitions therefore fail and are hereby dismissed. Hidayatullah, J. I agree that the petitions be dismissed. As I was a member of the Constitution Bench which decided Ghulam Sarwar’s(2) case I wish to say a few words in explanation. The judgment of Subba Rao, C.J. to which I was a party has expressed itself somewhat unhappily on ,the point on which it has been overruled in the judgment just delivered. The former Chief Justice upheld the extension of G.S.R. 1418/30-10-62 (which suspended the benefits of Arts. 21 and 22 to a foreigner) by G.S.R. 1275/27-8-3965. The latter order suspended Art. 14 in addition to the two articles already suspended. This ’suspension was upheld on the ground that there was a clear classification between citizens and foreigners and in a state of war and emergency foreigners could be treated as a class. In other words, the order was tested on the ground of Art. 14 itself which the order of the President sought to suspend. In the judgment just delivered it has been said that the reasoning in Ghulam Sarwar’s(3) case is difficult to understand and that the suspension of Art. 14 precludes examination of the order under that article. I should have thought that I had sufficiently explained my position during the discussion of the draft judgment (1) A.I.R. (1967) S.C. 1507: [1967] 3 S.C.R. 114 (2) [1968] 1 S.C.R. 197. (3) [1967] 2 S.C.R. 271. 238 in Ghulam Sarwar’s(1) case but it appears that in spite of my doubts about the width of language in that judgment, the decision to which I became a party continued to bear the meaning now attributed to it. If I may say with, great respect, the judgment just delivered also suffers from a width of language in the other direction. The truth lies midway. Although a suspension of a fundamental right under Art. 359(1) may be made either for the whole of India or any part of the territory of India, Ghulam Sarwar’s(1) case points out that there is nothing to prevent the President from restricting the scope of the order to a class of persons provided the operation of the order is confined to an area and to a period. As the order was applicable to the whole of India and for the duration of the emergency although it affected a class, namely, foreigners, it was upheld. This was not the application of Art. 14. This was said because the argument was that the order could only be with reference to the whole or a part of the territory of India and not with respect to a class such as foreigners. That meant that the Order was considered in relation to the words of Art. 359(1). Room was, however, to be left for the   of 11 play of Art. 14 for those theoretically possible (and fortunately ’only theoretically possible) cases in which the exercise of the power itself may be a cloak for discrimination, in other words, cases of mala fide action and clear abuse of the power for some collateral purpose. This strict reservation only was intended to go into the judgment in Ghulam Sarwar’s(1) case but if a wider meaning can be spelled out from that judgment I dissent from it and say that I never intended to ’be a party to such a wide statement. The examination under Art. 14 of the suspension of the article itself, as expressed in the judgment of Subba Rao C.J. gives a very different impression. For the same reason I cannot subscribe to the width of language in the judgment just delivered which apparently ’does not make any reservation at all. Therefore I agree to the order proposed but reserve my reasons. R.K.P.S. Petitions dismissed. (1) [1967] 2 S.C.R. 271"

Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated November 8, 9, 1968 of the Gujarat High Court in Special Civil Applications Nos. 595, 634, 636, 693, 694, 695, 696, 771 of 1962, 57 and 128 of 1963 and 39 of 1964. S.T. Desai, 1. N. Shroff and M. N. Shroff for the appellants (in all the appeals). C.K. Daphtary, K. L. Hathi, B. D. Sharma for S. P. Nayar, for the respondents (in all the appeals). The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Shah, C. J.-Under the Bombay Entertainments Duty Act 1 of 1923 entertainment duty is chargeable on the total collections from the visitors to a theatre. On March 18, 1960 the Collector, Junagarh issued instructions to his subordinate officers directing them to levy entertainment duty at the prescribed rate only on the net price receivable by the proprietor of the theatre and not on the total amount including entertainment duty collected from the visitors. Entertainment duty so computed was paid till January 1962 by the appellants who own a theatre at Junagadh. On January 11, 1962 the Government of Gujarat issued a memorandum that ""the duty (entertainment duty) is a percen tage of the payment for admission i.e. the amount which a person pays for being admitted to witness the entertainment, inclusive of the various items mentioned in clause (b) of section 2 of the Bombay Entertainment Duty Act, 1923. The amount which a person pays includes both sums-(i) what the Manager has to pay by way of duty; and (ii) what the Manager can retain as Net receipts’ and hence the duty has to be charged on the total amount payable by the person buying the ticket, including any SLIM charged separately by way of duty."" Pursuant to that notification entertainment duty was levied on the gross sum levied and paid by the visitors for admission to the theatre. By a petition moved in the High Court of Gujarat the appel lants challenged the validity of the memorandum ’dated January 11, 1962 and the notice of demand issued pursuant thereto and urged that the primary liability for payment of entertainment duty is by the Act imposed upon the visitor to the theatre, and that the proprietor of the theatre is merely an agent of the Government for collecting the duty : and that the proprietor has under 400 the Act to pay the duty which he collects from the visitors; and that he cannot be required to pay an amount which he does not collect from the visitors. The High Court rejected the petitions and against the order of the High Court this  Page 3 of 6 appeal has been preferred. The Act and the Rules framed thereunder prescribe the method of collection of entertainment duty. On each ticket issued to a person entitling him to enter the theatre for entertainment, a revenue stamp of a specified face value is affixed. The total amount that the visitor pays consists of two items, the net charge which the proprietor makes for the. ticket and the value of the stamp. Under the memorandum issued on March 18, 1960 the aggregate of the duty received by the appellants was paid over to the Government and the net value of the tickets remained with the proprietor. Under the memorandum issued on January 11, 1962, the duty payable to the Government was calculated at the appropriate rate applicable to the aggregate of the net value of the ticket and the duty paid by the visitor. In consequence of the notification the proprietor could collect from the visitor the amount shown as entertainment duty on the ticket but he was obliged to pay duty equal to the amount computed on the total amount paid by the visitor at the appropriate rate. The difference between the entertainment duty computed on the total value of the ticket and the value of the stamp affixed on the ticket was therefore borne by the proprietor. The relevant provisions which have a bearing on the question are these : Section 3 of the Act is the charging section. Insofar as it is relevant it provides : ""(1) There shall be levied and paid to the State Government on all payments for admission to any entertainment a duty (hereinafter referred to as ""entertainments duty"" at the following rate (a)* * * (b) in any other case 1. * * * * * 11. in any other area (i)out of the first 100 naye paise of payment for ad- 30 per cent of such mission payment. (ii)out of the next too naye paise of payment for ad- 45 per cent of such mission payment. (iii)out of the balance of the total payment for ad- 60 per cent of such mission payment. (1 A) (2)Where the payment for admission to an entertainment is made by means of a lump sum paid as a subscription or contribution to any society, or for a 401 season ticket or for the right of admission to a series of entertainments or to any entertainment during a certain period of time, or for any privilege, right, facility or thing combined with the right of admission to any enter tainment or involving such right of admission without further payment or at a reduced charge, the entertainments duty shall be paid on the amount of the lump SUM. Section 3A provides for payment of duty at the appropriate rates on complimentary tickets. By that section entertainment duty at the appropriate rates prescribed under s. 3 is payable as if full payment had been made for admission to the entertainment according to the class of seat or accommodation which the holder of such, ticket shall, be deemed to have been admitted for payment for the purpose of the Act. Section 4 provides for-the method of levy of duty. It provides, insofar as it is relevant : ""(1) Save as otherwise provided by this Act, no person other than a person who has to perform some duty in connection  Page 4 of 6 with an entertainment or a duty imposed upon him by any law, shall be admitted to any entertainment, except with a ticket stamped with an impressed, embossed, engraved or adhesive stamp(not before used) issued by the State Government for the payments for admission to the entertainment tainments duty, has been paid. (2) The State Government may, on the application of any entertainment in respect of which the entertainment duty is payable under section 3, allow the proprietor on such conditions as the State Government may prescribe to pay the amount of the duty due (a) by a consolidated payment of a percentage to be fixed by the (State Government) of the gross sum received by the proprietor on account of payments for admission to the entertainment and on account of the duty; (b) in accordance with returns of the payments for admission to the entertainment and on account of the duty; (c) in accordance with the results recorded by any mechanical contrivance which automatically registers the number of persons admitted. (3)* * * * * L807Sup CI/71 402 Section 6 provides for exemptions from payment of entertainment duty in certain specific classes of cases. Section 7 authorises the State Government to make rules for securing the payment of the entertainment duty and generally for carrying into effect the provisions of the Act. The expression ""entertainment"" is defined in s. 2(a) as including any exhibition, performance, amusement, game or sport to which persons are admitted for payment. A cinematograph show is ""entertainment"" within the meaning of the Act. Section 2(b) defines ""payment for admission"" as including (ii) any payment for seats or other accommodation in a place of entertainment. (iv) any payment for any purpose whatsoever connected with an entertainment which a person is required to make as a condition of attending or continuing to attend the entertainment in addition to the payment, if any, for admission to the entertainment;"" Section 2(c) defines ""proprietor"" in relation to any entertainment as including any person responsible for, or for the time being in charge of, the management thereof. By section 3 the duty is levied at the rates prescribed on all payments for admission and the method of levy is prescribed by s. 4(2). The proprietor is enjoined by S. 4(1) not to admit any person to an entertainment without a ticket. The proprietor pays the entertainment duty determined in the manner provided by clauses (a), (b) & (c) of sub-clause (2) of s. 4. He is permitted by the Act to collect entertainment duty on the net amount receivable by him, but he does not on that account become an agent for the Government. The charge is by s. 3 on payments received by the proprietor for admitting visitors to entertainment. Even where a ticket is not issued for an individual show but payment is received ""by means of a lump sum"" as subscription or contribution to any society, or by. season ticket or for the right of admission to a series of entertainments or during ascertain period of time, or for any privilege, right, facility, thing combined with the right of admission to any entertainment without further payment or at a reduced charge, the entertainments duty is payable on the lump sum : see s. 3 (2). Where a complimentary ticket is issued the duty is payable by the proprietor at the appropriate as if  Page 5 of 6 full payment had been made rate prescribed under the Act for admission to the entertainment. These provisions leave no room for doubt that liability for payment of the duty is imposed upon the proprietor and not upon the visitors to the theatre. Under s. 4(1) on the ticket for admission to any entertainment, 403 an impressed, embossed, engraved or adhesive stamp (.not before used) issued by the State Government of the value specified. in s. 3 must be affixed. The price which the visitor pays for a ticket for admission to ’an entertainment is the value of the stamp affixed and the net value of the ticket. But the statutory liability to pay the entertainment duty is imposed upon the proprietor and not on the visitor. The proprietor it is true passes on a part of the duty payable by him to the visitor, but even in respect of that amount he does not act as an agent of the Government. The rules framed under the Bombay Entertainments Dirty Act, 1923 do not also suggest a contrary scheme. Rule 7, insofar as it is relevant, provides : ""Except as provided in rules 15 and 23, every dutiable ticket, not being a complimentary ticket, issued on payment for admission to entertainment shall be in three parts. One part shall remain on the ticket book and the remaining two parts shall be detached therefrom and issued to the purchaser. Every dutiable ticket shall have each part clearly marked with the price of admission. and with the date and show for which it is available and also with the book number and the serial numbers and shall also have securely affixed to it a stamp of the value of the duty payable out of the said price of admission. A similar provision is made in respect of ""plural tickets"" where a number of persons are to be admitted on a single ticket. The use of the expression ""affixed to it a stamp of the value of the duty payable out of the said price of admission"" does not support the view that the amount of entertainment duty represented by the ticket alone is payable by the proprietor. It only means that the proprietor shall specify on the ticket the amount chargeable by him to the visitor and the duty in respect of which the stamp has been affixed. Rule 7 cannot operate to modify the charging section 3, nor section 4 relating to the method of levy. Rule; 15 and 23 which are referred to in r. 7 also do not support the submission made by counsel for the appellant. Rule 15 deals with unstamped tickets and r. 23 deals with the form of exemption granted by the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police. Rule 16 imposes. a duty upon every proprietor either making a consolidated payment under cl. (a) of sub-s. (2) of s. 4 or making payment in accordance with return of the payments for admission under cl. (b) of sub-s.(2) of s. 4, within ten days of the date of entertainment and to submit to the prescribed 404 officer a return in Form ""B"" showing the number of tickets (not being complimentary tickets) issued at each rate, the serial number of tickets issued, the gross amount received by sale of tickets and the amount of duty payable to the State Government. Under section 4(2) (a) the consolidated payment is a percentage of the gross sum (.not charge and the entertainment duty) received by the proprietor on account of payments for admission to the entertainment. That duty is charged under s. 4 (2) (b) in accordance with the returns relating to the payments for admission to the  Page 6 of 6 entertainment, under r. 16 the duty is again chargeable on the gross amount received by the proprietor. The definition of the expression ""payment for admission"" in S. 2(b) of the Act, is an inclusive definition; it includes by clause (iv) payment for any purpose whatsoever ""connected with an entertainment which a person is required to make as a condition of attending or continuing to attend the entertainment"". In our judgment entertainment duty is a payment which the proprietor is required to make as a condition for enabling visitors to attend or continue to attend the entertainment. Without such a payment the visitor cannot be admitted to the entertainment under s. 4(1) of the Act. That being so the expression ""payment for admission"" includes entertainment duty. We agree with the High Court that the appellant was liable to pay duty computed in the manner provided by S. 3 ( 1 ) (b) (ii) on the total amount received by the proprietor. But the method of levy of entertainment duty from the proprietors involves some hardship. It is implicit in the Act that the proprietor is entitled ""to pass on the liability"" for payment of entertainment duty to the visitors. But the visitor only pays the amount represented by the stamp affixed on the ticket. A proprietor paying entertainment duty on the total amount, received by him from the visitor will never be able to collect the full entertainment duty from the visitor. Apart of the duty payable by him Will have to come out of the amount received by him as net charge for the ticket. But we are dealing with a taxing statute and questions of hardship cannot justify us in departing from the provisions of ss. 3 and 4 of the Act. The Legislature must be deemed to have contemplated that only a part of the entertainment duty levied by the Government may be collected in the manner provided from the visitors to the theatre and the balance shall be paid by the proprietors. It may be observed that between March, 18, 1960 and January 11, 1962 the appellant collected and paid the duty which was actually received from the visitors to the theatre by stamps affixed on the tickets issued to them according to the notification issued by the Collector. It was thereafter when a fresh memorandum dated January 11, 1962 was issued requiring the proprietors of the theatres to pay tax on the aggregate amount of the net 4 05 value of the ticket and the entertainment duty that the proprietor was called upon to pay the difference. Till January 11, 1962 the proprietor acted pursuant to the memorandum dated March 18, 1960 issued by the Collector and collected the duty and paid it over. The Government of Gujarat later advised that the method of collection notified by the Collector was not the correct method. But the ’Act contains no provision for reopening assessments already made. When pursuant to return by the proprietor, payments were made and accepted under S. 4 (2) (b), the tax may be deemed to be assessed and paid, and the State cannot thereafter reopen the concluded assessments and seek to levy tax or duty which has escaped. The appeals fail except as to the amount claimed to be due for the period between March 18, 1960 and January 11, 1962. There will be no order as to costs. V.P.S.

Pursuant to that notification entertainment duty was levied on the gross sum levied and paid by the visitors for admission to the theatre. By a petition moved in the High Court of Gujarat the appel lants challenged the validity of the memorandum ’dated January 11, 1962 and the notice of demand issued pursuant thereto and urged that the primary liability for payment of entertainment duty is by the Act imposed upon the visitor to the theatre, and that the proprietor of the theatre is merely an agent of the Government for collecting the duty : and that the proprietor has under 400 the Act to pay the duty which he collects from the visitors; and that he cannot be required to pay an amount which he does not collect from the visitors.

(iv) any payment for any purpose whatsoever connected with an entertainment which a person is required to make as a condition of attending or continuing to attend the entertainment in addition to the payment, if any, for admission to the entertainment;"" Section 2(c) defines ""proprietor"" in relation to any entertainment as including any person responsible for, or for the time being in charge of, the management thereof. By section 3 the duty is levied at the rates prescribed on all payments for admission and the method of levy is prescribed by s. 4(2). The proprietor is enjoined by S. 4(1) not to admit any person to an entertainment without a ticket. The proprietor pays the entertainment duty determined in the manner provided by clauses (a), (b) & (c) of sub-clause (2) of s. 4. He is permitted by the Act to collect entertainment duty on the net amount receivable by him, but he does not on that account become an agent for the Government. The charge is by s. 3 on payments received by the proprietor for admitting visitors to entertainment. Even where a ticket is not issued for an individual show but payment is received ""by means of a lump sum"" as subscription or contribution to any society, or by. season ticket or for the right of admission to a series of entertainments or during ascertain period of time, or for any privilege, right, facility, thing combined with the right of admission to any entertainment without further payment or at a reduced charge, the entertainments duty is payable on the lump sum : see s. 3 (2). Where a complimentary ticket is issued the duty is payable by the proprietor at the appropriate as if  Page 5 of 6 full payment had been made rate prescribed under the Act for admission to the entertainment. These provisions leave no room for doubt that liability for payment of the duty is imposed upon the proprietor and not upon the visitors to the theatre. Under s. 4(1) on the ticket for admission to any entertainment, 403 an impressed, embossed, engraved or adhesive stamp (.not before used) issued by the State Government of the value specified. in s. 3 must be affixed. The price which the visitor pays for a ticket for admission to ’an entertainment is the value of the stamp affixed and the net value of the ticket. But the statutory liability to pay the entertainment duty is imposed upon the proprietor and not on the visitor. The proprietor it is true passes on a part of the duty payable by him to the visitor, but even in respect of that amount he does not act as an agent of the Government. The rules framed under the Bombay Entertainments Dirty Act, 1923 do not also suggest a contrary scheme. Rule 7, insofar as it is relevant, provides : ""Except as provided in rules 15 and 23, every dutiable ticket, not being a complimentary ticket, issued on payment for admission to entertainment shall be in three parts. One part shall remain on the ticket book and the remaining two parts shall be detached therefrom and issued to the purchaser. Every dutiable ticket shall have each part clearly marked with the price of admission. and with the date and show for which it is available and also with the book number and the serial numbers and shall also have securely affixed to it a stamp of the value of the duty payable out of the said price of admission. A similar provision is made in respect of ""plural tickets"" where a number of persons are to be admitted on a single ticket. The use of the expression ""affixed to it a stamp of the value of the duty payable out of the said price of admission"" does not support the view that the amount of entertainment duty represented by the ticket alone is payable by the proprietor. It only means that the proprietor shall specify on the ticket the amount chargeable by him to the visitor and the duty in respect of which the stamp has been affixed. Rule 7 cannot operate to modify the charging section 3, nor section 4 relating to the method of levy. Rule; 15 and 23 which are referred to in r. 7 also do not support the submission made by counsel for the appellant. Rule 15 deals with unstamped tickets and r. 23 deals with the form of exemption granted by the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police. Rule 16 imposes. a duty upon every proprietor either making a consolidated payment under cl. (a) of sub-s. (2) of s. 4 or making payment in accordance with return of the payments for admission under cl. (b) of sub-s.(2) of s. 4, within ten days of the date of entertainment and to submit to the prescribed 404 officer a return in Form ""B"" showing the number of tickets (not being complimentary tickets) issued at each rate, the serial number of tickets issued, the gross amount received by sale of tickets and the amount of duty payable to the State Government. Under section 4(2) (a) the consolidated payment is a percentage of the gross sum (.not charge and the entertainment duty) received by the proprietor on account of payments for admission to the entertainment. That duty is charged under s. 4 (2) (b) in accordance with the returns relating to the payments for admission to the  Page 6 of 6 entertainment, under r. 16 the duty is again chargeable on the gross amount received by the proprietor. The definition of the expression ""payment for admission"" in S. 2(b) of the Act, is an inclusive definition; it includes by clause (iv) payment for any purpose whatsoever ""connected with an entertainment which a person is required to make as a condition of attending or continuing to attend the entertainment"". In our judgment entertainment duty is a payment which the proprietor is required to make as a condition for enabling visitors to attend or continue to attend the entertainment. Without such a payment the visitor cannot be admitted to the entertainment under s. 4(1) of the Act. That being so the expression ""payment for admission"" includes entertainment duty. We agree with the High Court that the appellant was liable to pay duty computed in the manner provided by S. 3 ( 1 ) (b) (ii) on the total amount received by the proprietor. But the method of levy of entertainment duty from the proprietors involves some hardship. It is implicit in the Act that the proprietor is entitled ""to pass on the liability"" for payment of entertainment duty to the visitors. But the visitor only pays the amount represented by the stamp affixed on the ticket. A proprietor paying entertainment duty on the total amount, received by him from the visitor will never be able to collect the full entertainment duty from the visitor. Apart of the duty payable by him Will have to come out of the amount received by him as net charge for the ticket. But we are dealing with a taxing statute and questions of hardship cannot justify us in departing from the provisions of ss. 3 and 4 of the Act. The Legislature must be deemed to have contemplated that only a part of the entertainment duty levied by the Government may be collected in the manner provided from the visitors to the theatre and the balance shall be paid by the proprietors. It may be observed that between March, 18, 1960 and January 11, 1962 the appellant collected and paid the duty which was actually received from the visitors to the theatre by stamps affixed on the tickets issued to them according to the notification issued by the Collector. It was thereafter when a fresh memorandum dated January 11, 1962 was issued requiring the proprietors of the theatres to pay tax on the aggregate amount of the net 4 05 value of the ticket and the entertainment duty that the proprietor was called upon to pay the difference. Till January 11, 1962 the proprietor acted pursuant to the memorandum dated March 18, 1960 issued by the Collector and collected the duty and paid it over. The Government of Gujarat later advised that the method of collection notified by the Collector was not the correct method. But the ’Act contains no provision for reopening assessments already made. When pursuant to return by the proprietor, payments were made and accepted under S. 4 (2) (b), the tax may be deemed to be assessed and paid, and the State cannot thereafter reopen the concluded assessments and seek to levy tax or duty which has escaped. The appeals fail except as to the amount claimed to be due for the period between March 18, 1960 and January 11, 1962. There will be no order as to costs. V.P.S. Appeals dismissed"

Patel,, Ramesh Malik and Ganpat Rai, for the respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Shah, C.J. Sohan Lal Naraindas-hereinafter referred to as ’the plaintiff-commenced an action in the City Civil Court, Bombay, for a decree in ejectment against Laxmidas Raghunath hereinafter called ’the defendant’- alleging that the defendant was occupying a loft 19’ x 15’ on the upper floor of a building at Pragraj Galli, Mulji Jetha Market, Bombay under an agreement of licence dated November 3, 1958 and that the licence had been duly terminated and withdrawn but the defendant had failed and neglected to vacate the loft notwithstanding the demand. The defendant contended that he was a tenant of the loft, that the tenancy had not be duly terminated as required by law, that he was entitled to the protection of the Bombay Rents Hotel & Lodging House Rates Contract Act 1947 and that the Court had no jurisdiction to try the suit. The Trial Court dismissed the suit holding that the defendant was a tenant of the plaintiff and not his licensee. The decree was confirmed in appeal, by the High Court of Bombay. The High Court held that on the terms of the agreement and in the light of the surrounding circumstances the relationship between the parties was that of landlord and tenant. With certificate granted by the High Court the plaintiff has appealed to this Court. The certificate granted by the High Court is defective. The plaintiff applied for certificate under Art. 133 (1 ) (a) of the Constitution and in the alternative under Art. 1 3 3 (1 ) (c) of the Constitution. The High Court passed an order certifying the case under Art. 1 3 3 (1 ) (c). A certificate granted by the High Court must be supported by adequate reasons. It is obligatory upon the High Court to set out the question of public or private importance which in their opinion fall to be determined in the proposed appeal. Since we are of the view that there is no merit in this appeal, we have not thought it fit to vacate the certificate. The agreement dated November 3, 1958 was recorded formally in writing and was duly executed. The plaintiff was the lessee of a shop No. 11 in Pragraj Galli, Mulji Jetha Market, and 321 the loft of that shop was the subject matter of that agreement. The period of the agreement was one year. It  Page 3 of 5 was stated in the agreement that the loft ""was given on leave and licence basis for use and occupation"" of the defendant on the terms and conditions mentioned therein. The relevant conditions were ""1. The owner (the plaintiff) has agreed to grant the leave the licence for use and occupation of the said loft (Medo) of the said shop for a period one year commencing from Aso Vad 13 S. Y. 2014 to Aso Vad 12 S. Y. 2,015. 2. The Licensee (the defendant) shall pay to the Owner monthly compensation or Licensee fee at the rate of Rs. 250/- per month, and the Licensee has paid Rs. 3000/- (Rupee three thousand) only to the Owner as compensation or licence fee for the said period in advance on or before the execution of this agreement. 3 The Licensee shall have no right as a tenant or sub-tenant in respect of the said loft (Medo) of the said shop.

If the Licensee commits breach of any of the terms of this agreement in that case the Owner shall be entitled to terminate and recoke the leave and licence hereby granted without giving notice to the Licensee."" The defendant was put in exclusive possession of the loft. The plaintiff did not reserve possession of any part of the loft or a right of entry therein. The loft had a separate entrance. The customers of the defendant used the separate entrance to the loft during the business hours and his stock of cloth remained in the loft after business hours. The plaintiff and defendant were both cloth merchants, and the only consideration for granting the licence was the payment of Rs. 250/- per month. There is no L7Sup./71 322 evidence that the loft was given to the defendant out of sympathy or because of friendship, or relationship, or any similar motive. It was stipulated that the plaintiff may terminate the agreement by giving one month’s clear notice, the agreement could not be terminated by notice of a shorter duration. An attempt was deliberately made to camouflage the true nature of the agreement, by reciting in several clauses that the agreement was for leave and licence, and to emphasise the presence it was also recited that the defendant was not to have any right as tenant or sub-tenant in respect of the loft. At the trial the elder brother of the defendant was examined as a witness. He stated that the agreement dated November 3, 1958 was intended to be an agreement of lease, but the plaintiff insisted that the agreement be drafted with the  Page 4 of 5 conditions set out therein. Section 52 of the Easements Act defines a ""Licence"" ""Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do, in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such right be unlawful, and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called a licence "" Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act defines ""lease"" ""A lease of immovable property is a transfer of a right to enjoy such property, made for a certain time, express or implied, or in perpetuity, in consideration of a price paid or promised, or of money, a share of crops, service or any other thing of value, to be rendered periodically or on specified occasions to the transfer or by the transferee, who accepts the transfer on such terms. A licence confers a right to do or continue to do something in or upon immovable property of grantor which but for the grant of the right may be unlawful, but it creates no estate or interest in the immovable property of the grantor. A lease on the other hand creates an interest in the property demised. Intention of the parties to an instrument must be gathered from the terms of the agreement examined in the light of the surrounding circumstances. The description given by the parties may be evidence of the intention but is not decisive. Mere 323 use of the words appropriate to the creation of a lease will not preclude the agreement operating as a licence. A recital that the agreement does not create a tenancy is also not decisive. The crucial test in each case is whether the instrument is intended to create or not to create an interest in the property the subject matter of the agreement. If it is in fact intended to create an interest in the property it is a lease, if it does not, it is a licence. In determining whether the agreement creates a lease or a licence the test of exclusive epossession, though not decisive, is of significance. Mrs. M. N. Clubwala v. Fida Hussain Saheb and Ors(1). The Trial Court regarded exclusive possession of the premises, given to the defendant as conclusive of the question whether the loft was in the occupation of the defendant as a tenant. The Court observed that on a consideration of the clauses of the agreement it was unable to reach a conclusion whether the agreement was intended to operate as a lease or as a licence but since exclusive possession was given it must be regarded a lease. The High Court considered all the covenants and the attendant cir- cumstances and reached the conclusion that having regard to the exclusive possession given to the defendant it was intended to confer an interest in the loft and on that account the agreement operated as a lease and not as a licence. We have carefully considered the covenants in the light of the relevant surrounding circumstances. We are unable to disagree with the view taken by the High Court that by the terms of the agreement an interest was created in the loft  Page 5 of 5 in favour of the defendant.

Heard learned counsel for the parties. Leave granted. In Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.)No.1276/04 the first appellant Dr.K.T.Dholakia has since died, hence, that appeal has abated, so far as he is concerned. The appellants in these appeals were accused of having committed offences punishable under Sections 304-A, 201, 202, 203 of IPC by their act of medical negligence. The Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai acquitted the accused against which respondents herein sought for leave of the High Court to prefer an appeal under Section 378(4) of the IPC. The learned Single Judge before whom the matter came for preliminary hearing on 24th of July, 2003 issued notice before grant of leave. He also permitted Dasti service. On 14.8.2003 the matter was adjourned without granting leave on the ground that the respondents were not served. On 28.8.2003 since all the parties were not served, again the matter was adjourned. On 4.9.2003 the court noticed that the matter was listed for hearing on grant of leave to appeal and respondent No.1 in one of the cases was served through his wife which service was held to be not good service and respondent No.3 in one of the cases could not be served as he had gone out of India. It was also noticed that the appellant before the High Court had not taken any steps to serve respondent Nos. 1 and 3 in one of the petitions. Inspite of noticing the same, the court proceeded to hear the petitioner before it and granted leave to appeal. It is the said order which is challenged before this Court. Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants in these appeals submitted that once the Court decides to hear the respondents before granting leave then it is not open to the court to grant leave to appeal under Section 378(4) of IPC without hearing the respondents. In such a case a hearing at the stage of granting leave, according to the learned counsel is a mandatory requirement of law and in the instant case the same having not been done the   of 2 impugned order granting leave cannot be sustained. The learned counsel appearing for the State, however, contended that the granting of leave to file an appeal under Section 378(4) does not require hearing of the respondent- accused at that stage. The law only requires accused persons to be heard in the final hearing of the criminal appeal after leave is granted. Therefore, even if the appellants were not heard by the High Court at the stage of granting of leave, the order of the court granting leave does not become invalid in law. Having heard the learned counsel and perused the records, we do not think it is necessary to go into the legal question of requirement of law to hear the accused even at the stage of granting of leave to appeal under Section 378(4) of IPC. Since on facts of this case, these appeals can be disposed of without going into that question. On the facts narrated herein above, it is clear that after the order of acquittal recorded by the Magistrate, appeals were filed by the aggrieved respondents herein before the High Court under Section 378(4) of IPC which requires the grant of leave to appeal by the High Court before entertaining the appeals. When such an application for grant of leave came up before the court on 24.7.2003 the learned Judge who heard the petitioners before him considered it necessary to hear the respondents before granting leave, hence, issued notice in this regard to the respondents. It is an admitted fact and also proved from records before us the respondents before the High Court who are appellants herein were not actually served with the court notice and the court on 14.8.2003 adjourned the matter to take out fresh notice. On 4.9.2003 when the fact situation remained the same inasmuch as the respondents before the Court were not properly served, the Judge who heard the matter that day considered it unnecessary to hear the counsel for the petitioners before it and granted leave to appeal. In our opinion, on facts of this case since at a preliminary stage the court considered it necessary to hear the respondents- accused before granting leave and directed the issuance of notice, judicial propriety required the court at a subsequent stage to see that the respondents were served with court notice and to hear them before granting leave. Had the Court not issued the notice earlier it might have been a different thing in law. The Court once having thought it necessary to hear the respondents before granting leave, in our opinion, ought not to have granted leave ex parte more so in the background of the fact the notices earlier directed to be issued were not served because of lack of steps taken by the petitioners before it, hence, we think it appropriate that the impugned order granting leave should be set aside and the matter be remanded back to the High Court to hear the appellants herein on the question of grant of leave to appeal. Since all the respondents-accused are appellants herein, service of fresh notice is not necessary and we direct that the said appellants to appear in Criminal Application No.847 of 2003 before the High Court of Bombay on 11.2.2005 either personally or through their advocates and on such appearance the court will dispose of the above application after hearing the parties in accordance with law. The appeals are allowed.","JUDGMENT: J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP(Crl.)No.982 of 2004) (With Crl.A.No\0051453\005/04 @ SLP(Crl.)No.1276/04) SANTOSH HEGDE,J.

On the facts narrated herein above, it is clear that after the order of acquittal recorded by the Magistrate, appeals were filed by the aggrieved respondents herein before the High Court under Section 378(4) of IPC which requires the grant of leave to appeal by the High Court before entertaining the appeals. When such an application for grant of leave came up before the court on 24.7.2003 the learned Judge who heard the petitioners before him considered it necessary to hear the respondents before granting leave, hence, issued notice in this regard to the respondents. It is an admitted fact and also proved from records before us the respondents before the High Court who are appellants herein were not actually served with the court notice and the court on 14.8.2003 adjourned the matter to take out fresh notice. On 4.9.2003 when the fact situation remained the same inasmuch as the respondents before the Court were not properly served, the Judge who heard the matter that day considered it unnecessary to hear the counsel for the petitioners before it and granted leave to appeal. In our opinion, on facts of this case since at a preliminary stage the court considered it necessary to hear the respondents- accused before granting leave and directed the issuance of notice, judicial propriety required the court at a subsequent stage to see that the respondents were served with court notice and to hear them before granting leave. Had the Court not issued the notice earlier it might have been a different thing in law. The Court once having thought it necessary to hear the respondents before granting leave, in our opinion, ought not to have granted leave ex parte more so in the background of the fact the notices earlier directed to be issued were not served because of lack of steps taken by the petitioners before it, hence, we think it appropriate that the impugned order granting leave should be set aside and the matter be remanded back to the High Court to hear the appellants herein on the question of grant of leave to appeal. Since all the respondents-accused are appellants herein, service of fresh notice is not necessary and we direct that the said appellants to appear in Criminal Application No.847 of 2003 before the High Court of Bombay on 11.2.2005 either personally or through their advocates and on such appearance the court will dispose of the above application after hearing the parties in accordance with law. The appeals are allowed."

This batchof appeals relates to the acquisition of the lands of 97 acres 42 cents of land situated in the outskirts of the Tenali town of Guntur District in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The lands were acquired for the development of the colony for theweakersections-middleincome group persons etc. The notification underSection 4(1) of theland Acquisition Act was publishedon December 9,1980. TheLand Acquisition officer awarded compensation Rs. 22,940/- per acre for levelled up land and Rs. 21,700/-per acre for unlevelled land. On reference, the Subordinate judge, Tenali by hisaward and decree, dated February 26,1991 award uniformcompensation atthe rate of Rs.1,00,000/- per acre. On appeal by the appellantsas well as the claimants respondents, the High court by judgment and decree dated March 23,1994,furtherenhanced the compensation to Rs. 23.50 per sq. yard; thus it allowed the appeals of the respondent-claimants and dismissed those of the appellants. Thus, these appeals by special leaveand cross appeals by the respondent-claimants for further enhancement of compensation. They are disposedof by common order. The High Court, after rejecting the entire evidence adducedby theclaimants relied only on a saledeed, Ex. A 12 dated May 19,1978 relatingto a piece ofland of an extent of 250 sq. yardwith a thatchedhouse. It worked out compensation at the rate of Rs. 48/- per sq. yard; onthat basis, it gavemarginof deduction of 50% of the awarded compensation, namely, at the rate of Rs. 23.50per sq.yrd. The question for consideration is; whether the principle laid down by the HighCourt is correct in law? Theland Acquisition officer in his award had referred to the topographical features of the land thus. ""The landsunder acquisition form a   of 7 compact block surrounded on the north by Tenali-Guntur Railway Track, onthe east by lands owned bySouth Central Railways. On the south by landswhich abut the Tenali-Guntur highway roadand also built up area in T.S. No.22 (in the case for T.S. No.27) and on the west by Agril lands. T.S. No. 26 and 29 which fall in the compact block have already been acquired. The beneficiaries have raised a few huts here and there. R.S. No. A-250 also formspart ofthe block and it is under acquisition for house sites for weakersections separatelyunder aseparate scheme. All the lands in the block under acquisitionbarringa few I velled up fields are similar because ofthe following reasons (1) All the landsare more or less equally inaccessible from the township. (2) All the lands (excepting few levelled up fields) are read as wet paddy fields similar in soil fortility and productivity. (3) Excepting the few levelled on plots to level each of the under acquisition, similar levelling up cost is requiredto beincurred which works out to approximately Rs. 60,000/-per acre in the most conservative estimate. All the lands under acquisition have equal potentiality or otherwiseof being used as house sites. In between the blockof lands under acquisition,there is channel running in North-south direction and it touches theGuntur Narakodur Tenali Road. The channel is now not inuse. A metal roadhas been formed along with the channel bythe side ofTS. 15 to make across from truck road to the built up area in T.S. Nos. 23 and 22. T.S. No. 142 and T.S.Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 16 which are not under acquisition fieldin between the lands under acquisitionand the Guntur-Narakodur Tenali Road. Unless these fields are developed into Township, there is noprospect of the lands under acquisition features of a township. Onlya few fields stand classifiedin accounts as semidry and all others stand classified as wet. Notwithstanding the variation inclassification, all the lands under acquisitionexecuting a few levelled up plots are wet paddy  Page 3 of 7 fields onground. The few lands which were not grown with paddy were cultivated with dry crops like banana, sugar and chillies. To make the lands under acquisition suitable for house sites, the levels have to be raised by about 2 to3 feetto make themfit for building purposes. There can be no two opinions about the difficulty that is presently being experienced by personswhopurchase Agricultural lands in Tenali Town ingetting earth rooted to those lands forlevelling themup. From the experience of the Municipality which understood levellingwork for provisionof houses to weaker sections of the society, it can be said withcertainty thatthe cost involved in levelling up these lands to makethem fit for residential purposes would be not less than Rs. 60,000/- peracre.’ Onthe basis of the above factual material collected, the land Acquisition officer passed his award.The question arises:whether the acquired lands possessedof potential value for being used as building sites? The High Court has found, as pointed out by Shri Sudhir Chandra, learned senior counselfor the claimants, that the lands arepossessed of potential value for being used for building purpose. It is well settled legal position that the claimantsstand in the position of plaintiffs. Burden of proof is always on the claimants to prove byadduction of cogent and acceptable evidence that the lands are capableof fetching higher compensation than what is determined bythe land Acquisition officer, whichis only an offer. If the award is accepted withoutprotest, it binds theparties. It is the bounden duty of the court to evaluatethe evidence onthe basis of the human conduct, even if no rebuttalevidence is produced by theLand Acquisition Officer, to assess themarket value applying the relevant tests laid down by this Court inbead role of decisions. InPeriyarand PareekanniRubbersltd. V/s. State of Kerala [(1991) 4 SCC 195], this Court considered theentire case law as onthat date, on the principle of determination of market value andthe relevant test laid in that behalf. The burdenof proof that the amount awardedby the land AcquisitionOfficer/Collector is not adequate is always on the claimant. Theburden is to adduce relevant and material evidence to establish that the acquired landsare capable offetching highermarket value than the amount awarded by the land Acquisition officer/Collector or that the land Acquisition Officer/Collector proceeded ona wrongpremiseor applied a wrong principle of law. The object of the enquiry in a reference under Section 18 of the Act is to bring on record the price which the land under acquisition was capable of fetching in the open market as on the date of the notification. The relative situation of the acquiredland which is the subject of the sale transaction, the nature of the land, its suitability, nature ofthe useto which the lands are put to on the dateof thenotification, income derivedor derivable from or any other special distinctive feature whichthe land is possessed of and thesale transactions in respect of lands covered by thesame  Page 4 of 7 notification, are all relevant factors to be takeninto consideration in determiningthe market value. It is, therefore, theparamount dutyof thecourts of facts to subjectthe evidence to very close scrutiny, objectively assess the evidence tenderedby the parties on proper consideration thereof in correct perspective to arrive at adequate and reasonable market value.The attending facts and circumstances in each case wouldfurnishguidance to arrive at the market value of the acquired lands. it is equallyrelevant to consider the neighbourhoodlands as are possessed ofsimilar potentiality or anyadvantageous features or any special circumstances available ineach case. The Court is required to take into account all the relevant considerations. The Court isrequired to Keep at the back of its mind that the object of assessment is to arrive at reasonable and adequate market value of the lands. In thatprocess, thoughsome guess workis involve, feats of imagination should be eschewedand mechanical assessment of the evidence should beavoided. Even in the absence oforal evidence adduced by the land Acquisition officer or the beneficiaries the judges are to draw from their experience the normal human conduct of the parties and bona fide and genuinesale transactions are guiding star in evaluating the evidence. Misplaced sympathiesor undue emphasis solely on the claimants’right to compensation would place very heavy burden on the public exchequer to which other everyone contributes by direct or indirect taxes. Whether fair and reasonable and adequatemarket value is always a question of fact depends on the evidence adduced, circumstantial evidence, and probabilities arising in each case. The guiding star or the acid test would be whethera hypotheticalwillingvendor would offer the lands and a willing purchaser in normal human conduct would be willingto buyas a prudent man in normal human conduct would be willing to buy as aprudentman in normal market conditions prevailing in the open market in the locality in which the acquired lands are situated as on the date of the notification under Section 4 (1) of the Act; but not an anxiousbuyer dealing at arm’s length with throw away price, nor facade of sale orfictitious sales brought about in quick succession or otherwiseto inflate the market value. The judge should sit in the arm chair of thesaid willing buyer and seekan answer to the question whether in the given set of circumstances as aprudentbuyer he would offer the same market valuewhich the court proposed to fix for the acquired lands inthe available market conditions. The court is therefore, enjoined with the bounden duty of public function and judicial dispensation indetermination of the marketvalueof the acquired land and compulsory acquisition. The best evidence of the value of propertyare thesale transaction inrespectof theacquired land to which the claimant himself is a party; the time at whichthe property comes to be sold; nature of theconsideration and the manner in which the transaction cameto be brought out. They are all relevant factors. In the absenceof such a saledeed relating to the acquired land, the saletransactions relating to the neighbouring lands in the vicinity of the acquired land.In that case, the features required to be presentare ; it mustbe within a reasonable time of the date of thenotification;it must be a bonafide transaction; itshould be a sale of land similar to theland acquired or land adjacent to the land acquired; and it should possesssimilar advantageous features. These are relevant features to be takeninto consideration to prove  Page 5 of 7 the market value of the acquired land as on the date of the notification publishedunder Section 4(1) of the Act.This would be established by examining either the vendor or the vendee.If it is proved thatthey are not available, the scribe of the documentmay also be examined inthat behalf. Sect 51-A of the act only dispenses with the production of the original sale deed and directs to receive certifiedcopy for thereason that parties to the saletransaction would be reluctant topart with the original sale deed since acquisition proceedingswould take longtime before award of the compensation attains finality andin the meanwhile the owner of the sale deedis precluded from usingthe same for other purposesvis-a-vis thisland. The marking of the certified copyis perse is not admissiblein evidence unless it is duly proved and the witnesses, viz., the vendor or the vendee, are examined. Thisprinciple hasbeen repeated in a catena ofsubsequent decisions ofthis Court. InBasant Kumar & Ors. V/s. Union of India& Ors. [1996 (11) SCC 542], this Court pointed out thatdoctrine of equality in determination of the payment ofsame compensation to allclaimants covered by thesame notification, is not a good principle. Treating the entire villageas oneunit and uniformly determiningcompensation that basis is not sustainable in law. The Court must always determine market value prevailing as on the date of notification under Section 4 (1) of theAct andnot what was claimedby theparties. Even estimate of claimant is not decisive. The status of the claimant is irrelevant. It was reiterated that while determining the compensation under section23 (1), the Court should sit in the arm chairof a prudentwilling purchase in the open market and see whether he would be willing to offer the sameprice as is proposed to be fixed bythe Land Acquisition Officer asmarket value for the same or similar lands possessedof all the advantageous features.This test should always be kept in mind in analysing theevidence and the Court should answer affirmatively taking into consideration all the relevant factors. If feats of imagination are allowed the sway, the land Acquisition Officer/collector would overstep judicial decisions/quasi-judicial ordersand would land in misconduct amenable to disciplinary law. In that case, thecompensation as fixed by the Land Acquisition officer was reduced. In Special landAcquisition Officer,Dharwad V/s. Tajar Hanifabi (Smt.)[(1996)10 SCC 627], the question related to determination of the market value in respect of 6 acres of land. When theland in factwas used foragricultural purpose, no prudent andwiling vendee would offer the market value on square foot basis. Thus determination of compensation on the basis of square foot basis on thefoot of a small saletransaction washeld tobe a wrong principal of lawand according the determination of compensation was reducedfrom Rs. 1,96,20\- per acre to 45,000/-per acre. InAgricultural Produce Market Committee V/s.Land Acquisition officer and Asstt. Commissioner &Anr. [(1996) 10 SCC 629], same view was reiterated. It was held thatwhen a total7 acresand oddof landwas sought to be acquired no prudentpurchaser in the open market would offer to purchase the open land on square foot basis that too onthe basis of a few small sale transactions. This court pointed outthat such fixation of the market value wasillegal and accordingly reduced themarket value. Itwould thus b be settled lawthat the court is enjoined to determine the market value on an objective assessment of the conditions prevailing in theopen market; the nature of the user of the land to which theland was put  Page 6 of 7 on the dateof the notification,the income derived therefrom and all other relevant attending circumstances. The market value so determinedshould be just,adequate and reasonable. Inother words, it must be just equivalent to what the land is capable of fetching inthe open marketfrom a willing and prudent buyer, Therefore, the court is required to sit in thearm chair of a bona fide willing and prudentpurchaser in the openmarket and seekan answer to the question whether in the conditions prevailing in the market he would offerthe same market value as the court has proposed. The HighCourt has relied upon the oral evidence adducedby theclaimants in support ofthe Claim. It is not in dispute, aseven pointed out by the Land Acquisition Officer, that there is colony and railway shed etc. near the acquired lands. But the question is: whether on the date of the notification, the lands possessed of potential value and were fit foruse asbuilding site?On thebasis of the evidence adduced beforethe land Acquisition officer and the contents of theaward which is always part of the record and material evidence, it is difficult to accept the contention of ShriSudhir Chandra that thelands possessedof potential value for being used for building purpose. Except a small fraction of land, the elands are agricultural lands. Tomake them fit for construction, evenaccording to the conservative estimate,an amount of Rs. 23.50 per acre to level up the same. Itwould be figment of imagination to believethat aprudent builder woulddo that. TheHigh Court, therefore, is clearly in error in treating the lands as fitfor building purpose and on that basis determining the compensation after giving the deduction. The question, therefore, arises:what is the market value the lands were capable to fetch?In a reference under Section18, asheld earlier, the burden of proof always is on theclaimants to establishthat the lands are possessed of advantageous features and are, therefore, capable of fetching higher marketvalue than whatis determined by the Land Acquisition Officer in his awardunder Section 11. In view ofthe fact that the High Court itself hasrejected all the sale deedsexcept Ex. A-12which we are now constrained to reject, andas no other evidence isavailable, we cannot allow the appeals anddismissthe reference. The Court, insteadof indulging into feats of imagination, should sit in thearm chair of a prudent willing purchaser in the normal conditions of the market and seek answer to the question whether he would be willingto offer the amount proposed by the court, after taking into consideration all the features of the land existing ason thedate of the notification . In view of the material collected by theland Acquisition officer himself as referred in the award, we think that after taking into consideration allthe relevant factors, the reasonable compensation should beRs. 50.000/ per acre. The compensation is accordingly awarded. The question thenis: whether the claimants arealso entitled to additionalamountunder Section 23(1-A)? The notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was issued on December 9, 1980. The possession was taken on June 20,1981. The Amendment Act 68 of 1984 was introduced onthe floor of the House onApril 30, 1982. Thus it is clearthat possession wastaken prior to the introductionof Amendment Act. However, award under Section 11 was made onJune 19,1982, i.e., after the introduction of the bill but before the Actcame into force. It would be beneficial to refer to the transitional provisions contained in Section 30(1) (a) of the Amendment Act which reads as under:  Page 7 of 7 ""30. Transitional Provisions. - (1) The provisions of sub-section (1-A) ofSection 23 ofthe principal Act, as inserted by clause (a) of Section 15 of this Act, shall apply, and shall be deemed to have applied, also to,and inrelation to, (a) every proceeding for the acquisition of any land under the principal Act pending on the 30th day of April, 1982 (the date of introduction of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, 1982, in the Houseof the People, in whichno award has been made by the Collector before that date;"" InK.S. Paripoornan V/s. state of Kerala &Ors. [(1994) 5 SCC 593] the Constitution Bench considered the effect of the transitional provisions in section 30 (1) (a). The right to additional amount 12 per cent per annumon enhanced compensation was heldto bepart of the component of determination of compensation. If the proceedingswere pendingas on the date the notification underSection4(1) came into force, the provisions of the Amendment Act 68 of 1984 would apply. By operation of the transitional provision in Sections 30(1) (a), the claimant isentitled to additional amount @12 per cent per annum to be paid from the date ofthe notification under Section 4(1) till the date of depositinto court and where the possessionwas already taken, from the date of the notification till taking of possession. Similar view was reiteratedin special Tahsildar (LA) P.W.D. Schemes, Vijaywada V/s. M.A. Jabbar [(1995) 2 SCC 142] and Khanna Improvement Trust V/s. Land Acquisition Tribunal & Ors. [(1995) 2 SCC 142]. Accordingly, the respondent-claimants are entitled to payment of additional amount@12 per centper annum from the date of the notification till date of the taking possessionas mentioned hereinabove. Payment ofadditional amount underSection23(1-A)is a substantive right. Under those circumstances,by operation of thetransitional provisions in Section 30(1)(a), the claimants are entitledto theadditional amount at 12% per annum under Section 23 (1-A) from thedate ofnotification under Section 4(1) till that date of taking possession. Insteadof Rs.1,00,000/- peracre, they are entitled to compensation atthe rate of Rs.50,000/- per acre in respect of allacquired landswith solatium at 30% onthe enhanced compensation and interest @ 9% for one year from June 20, 1981 and on expiry thereof, @ 15% tilldate ofdepositinto the court; andadditional amount. Consequently, the award and decree ofthe referenceCourt stand modified. The judgment of theHigh court Stands set aside. The appeals are accordingly allowed. As a result, the cross appeals of the respondent-claimants stand dismissed.

The Court must always determine market value prevailing as on the date of notification under Section 4 (1) of theAct andnot what was claimedby theparties. Even estimate of claimant is not decisive. The status of the claimant is irrelevant. It was reiterated that while determining the compensation under section23 (1), the Court should sit in the arm chairof a prudentwilling purchase in the open market and see whether he would be willing to offer the sameprice as is proposed to be fixed bythe Land Acquisition Officer asmarket value for the same or similar lands possessedof all the advantageous features.This test should always be kept in mind in analysing theevidence and the Court should answer affirmatively taking into consideration all the relevant factors. If feats of imagination are allowed the sway, the land Acquisition Officer/collector would overstep judicial decisions/quasi-judicial ordersand would land in misconduct amenable to disciplinary law. In that case, thecompensation as fixed by the Land Acquisition officer was reduced. In Special landAcquisition Officer,Dharwad V/s. Tajar Hanifabi (Smt.)[(1996)10 SCC 627], the question related to determination of the market value in respect of 6 acres of land. When theland in factwas used foragricultural purpose, no prudent andwiling vendee would offer the market value on square foot basis. Thus determination of compensation on the basis of square foot basis on thefoot of a small saletransaction washeld tobe a wrong principal of lawand according the determination of compensation was reducedfrom Rs. 1,96,20\- per acre to 45,000/-per acre. InAgricultural Produce Market Committee V/s.Land Acquisition officer and Asstt. Commissioner &Anr. [(1996) 10 SCC 629], same view was reiterated. It was held thatwhen a total7 acresand oddof landwas sought to be acquired no prudentpurchaser in the open market would offer to purchase the open land on square foot basis that too onthe basis of a few small sale transactions. This court pointed outthat such fixation of the market value wasillegal and accordingly reduced themarket value. Itwould thus b be settled lawthat the court is enjoined to determine the market value on an objective assessment of the conditions prevailing in theopen market; the nature of the user of the land to which theland was put  Page 6 of 7 on the dateof the notification,the income derived therefrom and all other relevant attending circumstances. The market value so determinedshould be just,adequate and reasonable. Inother words, it must be just equivalent to what the land is capable of fetching inthe open marketfrom a willing and prudent buyer, Therefore, the court is required to sit in thearm chair of a bona fide willing and prudentpurchaser in the openmarket and seekan answer to the question whether in the conditions prevailing in the market he would offerthe same market value as the court has proposed. The HighCourt has relied upon the oral evidence adducedby theclaimants in support ofthe Claim. It is not in dispute, aseven pointed out by the Land Acquisition Officer, that there is colony and railway shed etc. near the acquired lands. But the question is: whether on the date of the notification, the lands possessed of potential value and were fit foruse asbuilding site?On thebasis of the evidence adduced beforethe land Acquisition officer and the contents of theaward which is always part of the record and material evidence, it is difficult to accept the contention of ShriSudhir Chandra that thelands possessedof potential value for being used for building purpose. Except a small fraction of land, the elands are agricultural lands. Tomake them fit for construction, evenaccording to the conservative estimate,an amount of Rs. 23.50 per acre to level up the same. Itwould be figment of imagination to believethat aprudent builder woulddo that. TheHigh Court, therefore, is clearly in error in treating the lands as fitfor building purpose and on that basis determining the compensation after giving the deduction. The question, therefore, arises:what is the market value the lands were capable to fetch?In a reference under Section18, asheld earlier, the burden of proof always is on theclaimants to establishthat the lands are possessed of advantageous features and are, therefore, capable of fetching higher marketvalue than whatis determined by the Land Acquisition Officer in his awardunder Section 11. In view ofthe fact that the High Court itself hasrejected all the sale deedsexcept Ex. A-12which we are now constrained to reject, andas no other evidence isavailable, we cannot allow the appeals anddismissthe reference. The Court, insteadof indulging into feats of imagination, should sit in thearm chair of a prudent willing purchaser in the normal conditions of the market and seek answer to the question whether he would be willingto offer the amount proposed by the court, after taking into consideration all the features of the land existing ason thedate of the notification . In view of the material collected by theland Acquisition officer himself as referred in the award, we think that after taking into consideration allthe relevant factors, the reasonable compensation should beRs. 50.000/ per acre. The compensation is accordingly awarded. The question thenis: whether the claimants arealso entitled to additionalamountunder Section 23(1-A)? The notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was issued on December 9, 1980. The possession was taken on June 20,1981. The Amendment Act 68 of 1984 was introduced onthe floor of the House onApril 30, 1982. Thus it is clearthat possession wastaken prior to the introductionof Amendment Act. However, award under Section 11 was made onJune 19,1982, i.e., after the introduction of the bill but before the Actcame into force. It would be beneficial to refer to the transitional provisions contained in Section 30(1) (a) of the Amendment Act which reads as under:  Page 7 of 7 ""30. Transitional Provisions. - (1) The provisions of sub-section (1-A) ofSection 23 ofthe principal Act, as inserted by clause (a) of Section 15 of this Act, shall apply, and shall be deemed to have applied, also to,and inrelation to, (a) every proceeding for the acquisition of any land under the principal Act pending on the 30th day of April, 1982 (the date of introduction of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, 1982, in the Houseof the People, in whichno award has been made by the Collector before that date;"" InK.S. Paripoornan V/s. state of Kerala &Ors. [(1994) 5 SCC 593] the Constitution Bench considered the effect of the transitional provisions in section 30 (1) (a). The right to additional amount 12 per cent per annumon enhanced compensation was heldto bepart of the component of determination of compensation. If the proceedingswere pendingas on the date the notification underSection4(1) came into force, the provisions of the Amendment Act 68 of 1984 would apply. By operation of the transitional provision in Sections 30(1) (a), the claimant isentitled to additional amount @12 per cent per annum to be paid from the date ofthe notification under Section 4(1) till the date of depositinto court and where the possessionwas already taken, from the date of the notification till taking of possession. Similar view was reiteratedin special Tahsildar (LA) P.W.D. Schemes, Vijaywada V/s. M.A. Jabbar [(1995) 2 SCC 142] and Khanna Improvement Trust V/s. Land Acquisition Tribunal & Ors. [(1995) 2 SCC 142]. Accordingly, the respondent-claimants are entitled to payment of additional amount@12 per centper annum from the date of the notification till date of the taking possessionas mentioned hereinabove. Payment ofadditional amount underSection23(1-A)is a substantive right. Under those circumstances,by operation of thetransitional provisions in Section 30(1)(a), the claimants are entitledto theadditional amount at 12% per annum under Section 23 (1-A) from thedate ofnotification under Section 4(1) till that date of taking possession. Insteadof Rs.1,00,000/- peracre, they are entitled to compensation atthe rate of Rs.50,000/- per acre in respect of allacquired landswith solatium at 30% onthe enhanced compensation and interest @ 9% for one year from June 20, 1981 and on expiry thereof, @ 15% tilldate ofdepositinto the court; andadditional amount. Consequently, the award and decree ofthe referenceCourt stand modified. The judgment of theHigh court Stands set aside. The appeals are accordingly allowed. As a result, the cross appeals of the respondent-claimants stand dismissed. No costs"

Balasubramanyan,"J U D G M E N T [Arising out of SLP (Civil) No.4529 of 2003] S.B. SINHA, J. Leave granted. Jurisdiction of the Assistant Charity Commissioner of Bombay in relation to the administration of the Appellant-Trust is in question in this appeal which arises out of a judgment and order dated 25th September, 2002 passed by the High Court of Judicature of Bombay in Writ Petition No. 1519 of 2002. The appellant herein is a religious trust. A scheme for management of the temple of Swami Narain Vadtal and other temples subordinate to it, was framed by the High Court of Bombay in the year 1922. The said scheme contained provisions as to how accounts should be maintained. Clauses 26 to 29 thereof, which are relevant as under: ""26. At each temple proper accounts of all receipts and expenditure shall be kept and for such purposes the following books of account shall be kept: i) Cash Book (Rukad) ii) Auro (Monthly Rozmel) iii) Nondh (Daily Journal) iv) Ledger containing separate Khatas for each head of income and expenditure including all expenditure on account of Tyagis. The ledger kept at the Vadtal Temple shall also contain separate khatas of (a) Name Vero and Bhets; (b) The household expenditure on account of the Acharya; (c) Any expenditure incurred on account of the Acharya on official tours and other official occasions; and (d) What may be paid to the Acharya on account of the personal expenditure but not of such personal expenditure 27. \005\005\005\005. 28. At the close of each Samvat year a separate Financial Statement and Balance Sheet shall be drawn up in regard to each temple and in regard to   of 7 the whole Institution. Copies of such Statements and Balance Sheets shall be furnished to each member of the Committee by the Kothari (Manager) before the first quarterly meeting of the following year and such Balance Sheets and Statements shall be checked and passed by the Committee at such Meeting. 29. In terms of Clause 29, all books of accounts and vouchers were to be opened to for inspection of each member of the Committee or all Satsangies appointed by the Committee."" Upon coming into force of the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950 (‘the Act’), the Trust was to be governed thereunder. An application for registration of the Trust was filed, pursuant whereto a certificate of registration in respect of the temple of Lakshmi Narayan Devasan and properties of the temples subordinate thereto was issued by the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Greater Bombay. The Parliament enacted The Bombay Reorganization Act, 1960 in terms whereof the State of Gujarat was carved out of the State of Bombay. In anticipation of such reorganization, the Legislature of the State of Bombay enacted the Bombay Statutory Corporations (Regional Act XXI of 1960). Section 3(1) hereof read as under: ""3(1) If it appears to the State Government expedient that any existing corporation which is operating and functioning immediately before the commencement of this Act, should be dissolved or that it should be reconstituted and reorganized so that there are established or functioning separate corporations for the Maharashtra and Gujarat regions, that Government may by order make provision for such dissolution or reconstitution and reorganization of such existing corporation."" The said provision was intended to apply to the institution of Charity Commissioner. The State of Gujarat was formed with effect from 1st May, 1960. However, immediately prior thereto, an Order known as the Bombay Charity Commissioner (Regional Reorganisation) Order, 1960 was issued which came into force with effect from 28th April, 1960, the relevant provisions whereof are as under:- ""The Bombay Charity Commissioner (Regional Reorganisation) Order, 1960: On the bifurcation of the former State of Bombay with effect from 1st May, 1960, the State of Gujarat and the State of Maharashtra, have their own Charity Organisations for public trusts within their respective States. In view of the bifurcation of the Bombay State, it was proposed to provide for the reorganization of such statutory corporate bodies into two intra-regional bodies before bifurcation of the State as also for distribution of their assets and liabilities etc., and allocation of their employees. By virtue of the Legal Department Order No. 12921/E, dated the 28th April, 1960, the Charity Commissioner, Bombay, a corporation sole, was reconstituted and reorganized so as to constitute a new corporation for Gujarat Region and to reconstitute the existing corporation to function for Maharashtra Region.""  Page 3 of 7 Clauses 4 (b) & (c), 5 and 6 (a) & (b) read thus:- ""4. Registration of public trusts where property or office is situate \026 In the case of a public trust duly registered under the Act before the appointed day, or deemed to be so registered, if, immediately before that day, - (a) \005\005\005\005\005\005\005. (b) the trust property is situated partly in the Maharashtra region and partly in the Gujarat region, then in respect of so much of the said property as is situate in the Maharashtra region or the Gujarat region, the trust shall, whether the office for the administration of the trust is or is not situate in that region, be deemed to be so registered in that day without further inquiry, charge or fee in the Maharashtra region or, as the case may be, the Gujarat region. (c) The trust property is situate in the Maharashtra region and the office for the administration of the trust is situate in the Gujarat region or vice versa, then the trust shall be deemed to be so registered on that day without further inquiry, charge or fee in each of the two regions."" ""5. Payment from Public Trusts Administration Fund of existing Corporation to new Corporation. \026 From the balance standing to the credit of the Public Trusts Administration Fund of the existing Corporation (including the investment made therefrom), immediately before the appointed day, and struck after taking into account all outstanding liabilities upto that date, there shall be paid to the new Corporation in respect of the Gujarat region an amount in the ration which the income from all sources including any sums specified in clauses (a) to (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 57 of the Act, court fees and miscellaneous receipts other than deposits received in respect of that region during the period between the establishment of the Public Trusts Administration Fund for the first time under the Act and the 30th November, 1959, bears to the total income from those sources credited to that fund during the said period from the Maharashtra as well as Gujarat regions."" ""6. Recovery of outstanding contributions and dues. \026 The right to recover contributions and other dues, payable before the appointed day in respect of any public trust but not recovered, shall belong (a) Where the trust under paragraph 4 is deemed to be registered exclusively in the Maharashtra or the Gujarat region, to the Corporation having jurisdiction over that region. (b) Where the trust is deemed to be registered in both the regions, to the Corporation having jurisdiction over the region within which the Public Trusts Registration Office in which the trust was registered is, on that day, situate."" In the year 1961, despite the 1960 Act and 1960 Order, presumably, in view of the fact that one of the temples was situate in the State of  Page 4 of 7 Maharashtra, the appellant herein filed an application for registration thereof to the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Bombay and the same was granted. The appellant indisputably also filed Statements of Accounts in respect of the said trust up to 1973 before the Maharashtra Charity Commissioner’s office. It is not in dispute that the office of the trust had been situate in the State of Gujarat. In the meanwhile, having regard to the fact that the office of the trust was situate in the State of Gujarat, an application was filed for modification of the said scheme in the City Civil Court at Ahmedabad. A contention raised in the suit that the Courts of Gujarat had no jurisdiction was negatived. Ultimately, the said scheme was modified by the Gujarat High Court by a judgment and Order dated 20th June, 1974, clause 30(c ) of the Scheme as mentioned is as under: ""30(c) The Board shall within nine months after the close of every financial year, prepare a balance sheet and the statement of income and expenditure for the said year and forward the same together with the Auditor’s report to every person whose name is entered in the Voters’ list and also to Acharya."" According to the appellant, the Trust had been rendering its accounts to the Assistant Charity Commissioner in Gujarat at Nadiad and had also been filing other documents and changed reports from time to time therein. Respondent No. 1 herein claiming himself to be a member of the trust, filed an application before the Assistant Charity Commissioner of Greater Bombay purportedly under Section 41A and 41B of the Act praying, inter alia, for appointment of proper persons and trustees of the said trust. By an order dated 31.12.2001, the said application was allowed. The Assistant Charity Commissioner in the said order directed: ""1. The application No. 5924/2000 is partly allowed. 2. The opponents are hereby directed to submit the audited statement of Account from years 1973 to 2001 within fortnight. 3. The opponents are further directed to submit the change report of changes occurred from time to time in trustees, properties etc. U/s. of the B.P.T. Act, 1950 within fortnight. 4. The opponents are further directed to take the steps for amendment of the scheme framed by Hon’ble High Court of Bombay, in Civil Application No. 690/1937."" A writ petition filed there-against by the appellant herein was dismissed by the Bombay High Court by reason of the judgment impugned herein opining that as the appellant never challenged the vires of the provisions of the Act or the 1960 Order and having itself filed an application for registration and furthermore having filed the statement of accounts before Assistant Charity Commissioner after 1973, they have disentitled themselves from contending that the provisions of the Act, 1960 or the Order, 1960 are unconstitutional. The appellants are thus before us. The short question which arises for consideration in this appeal is as to whether the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Greater Bombay had jurisdiction to interfere with the administration of the Appellant-trust.  Page 5 of 7 The trust was registered at Baroda in the State of Gujarat. Some proceedings in relation to the said trust were also initiated in the State of Gujarat. However, after the Reorganisation Act came into force, an application for registration of the property situate in Gujarat was filed. The audited statements of accounts admittedly were also filed till 1973. But as would appear from the discussion hereinafter, the same by itself would not be determinative of the jurisdictional question raised before us. The High Court had proceeded to dismiss the writ petition of the appellant herein only on the ground that the jurisdiction of the Assistant Charity Commissioner could not have been questioned by the appellant as the vires of 1960 Act or the 1960 Order had not been questioned by them. If by reason of the provisions of the said Act or the 1960 Order, the jurisdiction of the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Bombay was confined only to the properties situate within the State of Maharashtra, having regard to the doctrine of lex-sites, the said authority could not have assumed jurisdiction in respect of the entire trust. The Assistant Charity Commissioner, Bombay derived his jurisdiction from the provisions of the Bombay Public Trust Act. Upon reorganisation of the State, he had a limited jurisdiction to exercise. All the provisions of the said Act were indisputably also not applicable to both the State of Maharashtra and the State of Gujarat. The Assistant Charity Commissioner exercised his jurisdiction in terms of Section 41A and 41B of the Act. Section 41A of the Act reads thus: ""41A. Power of Commissioner to issue directions (for proper administration of the trust) \026 (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Charity Commissioner may from time to time issue directions to any trustee of a public trust or any person connected therewith, to ensure that the trust is properly administered, and the income thereof is properly accounted for or duly appropriated and applied to the objects and for the purposes of the trust; and the Charity Commissioner may also give directions to the trustees or such person if he finds that any property of the trust is in danger of being wasted, damaged, alienated or wrongfully sold, removed or disposed of. (2) It shall be the duty of every trustee or of such person to comply with the directions issued under sub-section (1). Section 41B of the Act indisputably is not applicable in the State of Gujarat. The jurisdiction of the Assistant Commissioners of Greater Bombay and State of Gujarat is required to be determined primarily on a construction of Clauses 4(b) and 4(c) of the 1960 Order. Indisputably, the office for administration of the trust is situate in the State of Gujarat i.e. Gujarat region. Only some properties of the trust are situate in the Maharashtra region. Clause 4(c) creates a legal fiction in terms whereof the trust shall be deemed to be registered in Gujarat region whereafter no other or further inquiry is required to be conducted. The trust was already registered having its office at Baroda. The said registration, therefore, continued to have force. The trust has properties both in Maharashtra and Gujarat regions. In terms of clause 4(b) of the order, only so much of the property which was situate in the Maharashtra region would be deemed to be so registered in Bombay. The jurisdiction of the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Greater Bombay was, therefore, confined to only the property which was situate  Page 6 of 7 within the Maharashtra region. The High Court, therefore, in our opinion, committed a manifest error insofar as it proceeded to hold that the appellants in view of their conduct could not question the jurisdiction of the Assistant Charity Commissioner of Bombay. The contentions raised in this appeal should have been determined having regard to the doctrine of lex-situs. The law in this behalf, in view of the provisions of the Act and the Order, are clear and explicit. Whether in the area of International law or the domestic law, lex-situs has to be determined in the context of the proper law applicable therefor, be it in the realm of contract or otherwise. [See Delhi Cloth & General Mills v. Surnam Singh, AIR 1955 SC 950] The Legislature of a State while enacting a law is required to maintain the territorial nexus. Only in certain cases, extra-territoriality provided for in the Act is accepted. The field of legislation in respect of religious endowments and religious institutions is referable to Item 28 of List III of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Ordinarily, therefore, the Legislation enacted by a State will be applicable only within the territorial limits thereof. There is a general presumption that the Legislature does not intend to exceed its jurisdiction. An Act relating to religious and charitable institutions would be presumed to be applicable only in respect of the properties or any part thereof situate in the State. The 1960 Act, however, makes the provisions explicit, clear and unambiguous. The property of the Trust situate within the Maharashtra region in terms of Clause 4(b) of the 1960 Order is to be deemed to be registered with the Charity Commissioner, Bombay. The said authority could thus have exercised its jurisdiction only in respect of that property. It had no jurisdiction in relation to the administration of the entire trust as the office of the trust is situate within the State of Gujarat. The Assistant Charity Commissioner, therefore, could not have issued any direction as prayed for in the application filed before it by the first respondent herein. A statutory authority, as is well known, must exercise its jurisdiction within the four corners of the statute. It cannot act beyond the same. Any order which is passed by an authority which lacked inherent jurisdiction would be ultra vires. [See Kiran Singh & Ors. v. Chaman Paswan & Ors, (1955) 1 SCR 117] In Anant Prasad Lakshminiwas Ganeriwal v. State of Andhra Pradesh [AIR 1963 SC 852], this Court relying on its earlier decision in State of Bihar v. Charusila Dasi [AIR 1959 SC 1002], opined: ""\005This decision, in our opinion, makes it abundantly clear that where the trust is situate in a particular State, the law of that State will apply to the trust, even though any part of the trust property whether large or small, is situate outside the State where the trust is situate."" In Charity Commissioner, Bombay v. Administrator of the Shringeri Math and its properties [AIR 1969 SC 566], this Court embarked on a discussion of the question as to how situs of the trust is required to be determined and opined: ""It seems to us that in view of the above authorities, in order to determine the situs of the trust which consists of a math and a subordinate so called math or maths, it is the situs of the principal math which will determine the applicability of the Act. We need not here decide the position of an independent real math though connected with another math. The High Court has found in this case that in the Nasik math no religious instructions are imparted and no spiritual service is rendered to any body of disciples. Further, no member of the body is allowed to enter the place of worship without permission although  Page 7 of 7 worship is carried out by the pujaries according to vedic usage. In view of these findings, the Nasik math cannot be held to be a real math or temple within the definitions set out above. In our opinion, the High Court was right in holding that the Nasik math is not liable to be registered under the Act."" Yet again, dealing with almost an identical question, this Court in Ramswarup Guru Chhote Balakdas v. Motiram Khandu Patil & Ors. [AIR 1968 SC 422] opined that two different authorities cannot exercise the right to supervise and control the management of the trust properties, holding: ""\005The curious result of such a construction would be that though the trust is situate and is administered at Burhanpur in Madhya Pradesh, the authorities under the Bombay Act can claim to control its management."" It was categorically held: ""\005The fact that a part of its property is situate in Maharashtra State though the trust is within Madhya Pradesh State, would not mean that the trust would be governed partly by the Madhya Pradesh Act and partly by the Bombay Act. Such a division of the trust and its administration is not contemplated by either of the two Acts. It is, therefore, clear that the present trust does not fall within the ambit of Section 28 and is not one of those trusts which can be deemed to be registered under the Bombay Act. That being so, it is obviously not a trust which fulfils the second condition of Section 88B of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act and the appellant cannot be said to be entitled to the certificate under that Section."" In the premises above-mentioned, the jurisdiction of the Charity Commissioner, Bombay must be held to be confined only to the management of the property situate within the State of Maharashtra and not in relation to the entire trust. The Charity Commissioner did not find that the allegations relating to mismanagement had any foundation. It has been clearly held that the said allegations are not proved. The Charity Commissioner also declined to pass an order in terms of Section 41A as regards the prayer for appointment of an administrator. The first respondent was only given liberty to file an appropriate application under the Act. In the event, such an application is filed, indisputably the same has to be determined on its own merit. We would, however, observe that any such application alleging to mismanagement of the trust, if filed, may be forwarded to the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Gujarat who shall deal with it. It is further made clear that the respondent would be at liberty to inspect the audited accounts in the office of the Assistant Charity Commissioner in terms of the scheme framed by the Gujarat High Court. In view of the aforementioned observations and directions, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. The appeal is, therefore, allowed. In the facts and circumstances, the parties shall bear their own costs","J U D G M E N T [Arising out of SLP (Civil) No.4529 of 2003] S.B. SINHA, J. Leave granted. Jurisdiction of the Assistant Charity Commissioner of Bombay in relation to the administration of the Appellant-Trust is in question in this appeal which arises out of a judgment and order dated 25th September, 2002 passed by the High Court of Judicature of Bombay in Writ Petition No. 1519 of 2002. The appellant herein is a religious trust. A scheme for management of the temple of Swami Narain Vadtal and other temples subordinate to it, was framed by the High Court of Bombay in the year 1922. The said scheme contained provisions as to how accounts should be maintained. Clauses 26 to 29 thereof, which are relevant as under: ""26.

An application for registration of the Trust was filed, pursuant whereto a certificate of registration in respect of the temple of Lakshmi Narayan Devasan and properties of the temples subordinate thereto was issued by the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Greater Bombay. The Parliament enacted The Bombay Reorganization Act, 1960 in terms whereof the State of Gujarat was carved out of the State of Bombay.

The said provision was intended to apply to the institution of Charity Commissioner. The State of Gujarat was formed with effect from 1st May, 1960.

(b) Where the trust is deemed to be registered in both the regions, to the Corporation having jurisdiction over the region within which the Public Trusts Registration Office in which the trust was registered is, on that day, situate."" In the year 1961, despite the 1960 Act and 1960 Order, presumably, in view of the fact that one of the temples was situate in the State of  Page 4 of 7 Maharashtra, the appellant herein filed an application for registration thereof to the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Bombay and the same was granted. The appellant indisputably also filed Statements of Accounts in respect of the said trust up to 1973 before the Maharashtra Charity Commissioner’s office. It is not in dispute that the office of the trust had been situate in the State of Gujarat. In the meanwhile, having regard to the fact that the office of the trust was situate in the State of Gujarat, an application was filed for modification of the said scheme in the City Civil Court at Ahmedabad. A contention raised in the suit that the Courts of Gujarat had no jurisdiction was negatived. Ultimately, the said scheme was modified by the Gujarat High Court by a judgment and Order dated 20th June, 1974, clause 30(c ) of the Scheme as mentioned is as under: ""30(c) The Board shall within nine months after the close of every financial year, prepare a balance sheet and the statement of income and expenditure for the said year and forward the same together with the Auditor’s report to every person whose name is entered in the Voters’ list and also to Acharya."" According to the appellant, the Trust had been rendering its accounts to the Assistant Charity Commissioner in Gujarat at Nadiad and had also been filing other documents and changed reports from time to time therein. Respondent No. 1 herein claiming himself to be a member of the trust, filed an application before the Assistant Charity Commissioner of Greater Bombay purportedly under Section 41A and 41B of the Act praying, inter alia, for appointment of proper persons and trustees of the said trust. By an order dated 31.12.2001, the said application was allowed. The Assistant Charity Commissioner in the said order directed: ""1. The application No. 5924/2000 is partly allowed. 2. The opponents are hereby directed to submit the audited statement of Account from years 1973 to 2001 within fortnight. 3. The opponents are further directed to submit the change report of changes occurred from time to time in trustees, properties etc. U/s. of the B.P.T. Act, 1950 within fortnight. 4. The opponents are further directed to take the steps for amendment of the scheme framed by Hon’ble High Court of Bombay, in Civil Application No. 690/1937."" A writ petition filed there-against by the appellant herein was dismissed by the Bombay High Court by reason of the judgment impugned herein opining that as the appellant never challenged the vires of the provisions of the Act or the 1960 Order and having itself filed an application for registration and furthermore having filed the statement of accounts before Assistant Charity Commissioner after 1973, they have disentitled themselves from contending that the provisions of the Act, 1960 or the Order, 1960 are unconstitutional. The appellants are thus before us. The short question which arises for consideration in this appeal is as to whether the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Greater Bombay had jurisdiction to interfere with the administration of the Appellant-trust.  Page 5 of 7 The trust was registered at Baroda in the State of Gujarat. Some proceedings in relation to the said trust were also initiated in the State of Gujarat. However, after the Reorganisation Act came into force, an application for registration of the property situate in Gujarat was filed. The audited statements of accounts admittedly were also filed till 1973. But as would appear from the discussion hereinafter, the same by itself would not be determinative of the jurisdictional question raised before us. The High Court had proceeded to dismiss the writ petition of the appellant herein only on the ground that the jurisdiction of the Assistant Charity Commissioner could not have been questioned by the appellant as the vires of 1960 Act or the 1960 Order had not been questioned by them. If by reason of the provisions of the said Act or the 1960 Order, the jurisdiction of the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Bombay was confined only to the properties situate within the State of Maharashtra, having regard to the doctrine of lex-sites, the said authority could not have assumed jurisdiction in respect of the entire trust. The Assistant Charity Commissioner, Bombay derived his jurisdiction from the provisions of the Bombay Public Trust Act. Upon reorganisation of the State, he had a limited jurisdiction to exercise. All the provisions of the said Act were indisputably also not applicable to both the State of Maharashtra and the State of Gujarat. The Assistant Charity Commissioner exercised his jurisdiction in terms of Section 41A and 41B of the Act. Section 41A of the Act reads thus: ""41A. Power of Commissioner to issue directions (for proper administration of the trust) \026 (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Charity Commissioner may from time to time issue directions to any trustee of a public trust or any person connected therewith, to ensure that the trust is properly administered, and the income thereof is properly accounted for or duly appropriated and applied to the objects and for the purposes of the trust; and the Charity Commissioner may also give directions to the trustees or such person if he finds that any property of the trust is in danger of being wasted, damaged, alienated or wrongfully sold, removed or disposed of. (2) It shall be the duty of every trustee or of such person to comply with the directions issued under sub-section (1). Section 41B of the Act indisputably is not applicable in the State of Gujarat. The jurisdiction of the Assistant Commissioners of Greater Bombay and State of Gujarat is required to be determined primarily on a construction of Clauses 4(b) and 4(c) of the 1960 Order. Indisputably, the office for administration of the trust is situate in the State of Gujarat i.e. Gujarat region. Only some properties of the trust are situate in the Maharashtra region. Clause 4(c) creates a legal fiction in terms whereof the trust shall be deemed to be registered in Gujarat region whereafter no other or further inquiry is required to be conducted. The trust was already registered having its office at Baroda. The said registration, therefore, continued to have force. The trust has properties both in Maharashtra and Gujarat regions. In terms of clause 4(b) of the order, only so much of the property which was situate in the Maharashtra region would be deemed to be so registered in Bombay. The jurisdiction of the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Greater Bombay was, therefore, confined to only the property which was situate  Page 6 of 7 within the Maharashtra region. The High Court, therefore, in our opinion, committed a manifest error insofar as it proceeded to hold that the appellants in view of their conduct could not question the jurisdiction of the Assistant Charity Commissioner of Bombay. The contentions raised in this appeal should have been determined having regard to the doctrine of lex-situs. The law in this behalf, in view of the provisions of the Act and the Order, are clear and explicit. Whether in the area of International law or the domestic law, lex-situs has to be determined in the context of the proper law applicable therefor, be it in the realm of contract or otherwise. [See Delhi Cloth & General Mills v. Surnam Singh, AIR 1955 SC 950] The Legislature of a State while enacting a law is required to maintain the territorial nexus. Only in certain cases, extra-territoriality provided for in the Act is accepted. The field of legislation in respect of religious endowments and religious institutions is referable to Item 28 of List III of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Ordinarily, therefore, the Legislation enacted by a State will be applicable only within the territorial limits thereof. There is a general presumption that the Legislature does not intend to exceed its jurisdiction. An Act relating to religious and charitable institutions would be presumed to be applicable only in respect of the properties or any part thereof situate in the State. The 1960 Act, however, makes the provisions explicit, clear and unambiguous. The property of the Trust situate within the Maharashtra region in terms of Clause 4(b) of the 1960 Order is to be deemed to be registered with the Charity Commissioner, Bombay. The said authority could thus have exercised its jurisdiction only in respect of that property. It had no jurisdiction in relation to the administration of the entire trust as the office of the trust is situate within the State of Gujarat. The Assistant Charity Commissioner, therefore, could not have issued any direction as prayed for in the application filed before it by the first respondent herein. A statutory authority, as is well known, must exercise its jurisdiction within the four corners of the statute. It cannot act beyond the same. Any order which is passed by an authority which lacked inherent jurisdiction would be ultra vires. [See Kiran Singh & Ors. v. Chaman Paswan & Ors, (1955) 1 SCR 117] In Anant Prasad Lakshminiwas Ganeriwal v. State of Andhra Pradesh [AIR 1963 SC 852], this Court relying on its earlier decision in State of Bihar v. Charusila Dasi [AIR 1959 SC 1002], opined: ""\005This decision, in our opinion, makes it abundantly clear that where the trust is situate in a particular State, the law of that State will apply to the trust, even though any part of the trust property whether large or small, is situate outside the State where the trust is situate."" In Charity Commissioner, Bombay v. Administrator of the Shringeri Math and its properties [AIR 1969 SC 566], this Court embarked on a discussion of the question as to how situs of the trust is required to be determined and opined: ""It seems to us that in view of the above authorities, in order to determine the situs of the trust which consists of a math and a subordinate so called math or maths, it is the situs of the principal math which will determine the applicability of the Act. We need not here decide the position of an independent real math though connected with another math. The High Court has found in this case that in the Nasik math no religious instructions are imparted and no spiritual service is rendered to any body of disciples. Further, no member of the body is allowed to enter the place of worship without permission although  Page 7 of 7 worship is carried out by the pujaries according to vedic usage. In view of these findings, the Nasik math cannot be held to be a real math or temple within the definitions set out above. In our opinion, the High Court was right in holding that the Nasik math is not liable to be registered under the Act."" Yet again, dealing with almost an identical question, this Court in Ramswarup Guru Chhote Balakdas v. Motiram Khandu Patil & Ors. [AIR 1968 SC 422] opined that two different authorities cannot exercise the right to supervise and control the management of the trust properties, holding: ""\005The curious result of such a construction would be that though the trust is situate and is administered at Burhanpur in Madhya Pradesh, the authorities under the Bombay Act can claim to control its management."" It was categorically held: ""\005The fact that a part of its property is situate in Maharashtra State though the trust is within Madhya Pradesh State, would not mean that the trust would be governed partly by the Madhya Pradesh Act and partly by the Bombay Act. Such a division of the trust and its administration is not contemplated by either of the two Acts. It is, therefore, clear that the present trust does not fall within the ambit of Section 28 and is not one of those trusts which can be deemed to be registered under the Bombay Act. That being so, it is obviously not a trust which fulfils the second condition of Section 88B of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act and the appellant cannot be said to be entitled to the certificate under that Section."" In the premises above-mentioned, the jurisdiction of the Charity Commissioner, Bombay must be held to be confined only to the management of the property situate within the State of Maharashtra and not in relation to the entire trust. The Charity Commissioner did not find that the allegations relating to mismanagement had any foundation. It has been clearly held that the said allegations are not proved. The Charity Commissioner also declined to pass an order in terms of Section 41A as regards the prayer for appointment of an administrator. The first respondent was only given liberty to file an appropriate application under the Act. In the event, such an application is filed, indisputably the same has to be determined on its own merit. We would, however, observe that any such application alleging to mismanagement of the trust, if filed, may be forwarded to the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Gujarat who shall deal with it. It is further made clear that the respondent would be at liberty to inspect the audited accounts in the office of the Assistant Charity Commissioner in terms of the scheme framed by the Gujarat High Court. In view of the aforementioned observations and directions, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. The appeal is, therefore, allowed. In the facts and circumstances, the parties shall bear their own costs"
51,Appeal (civil) 3124 of 2008,Babu Singh & Ors,Ram Sahai @ Ram Singh,30/04/2008,S.B. Sinha & V.S. Sirpurkar,"JUDGMENT: J U D G M E N T REPORTABLE CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3124 OF 2008 (Arising out of SLP (C) No.10288 of 2006) S.B. Sinha, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. Interpretation of Section 69 of the Evidence Act, 1872 is in question in this appeal which arises out of a judgment and order dated 11.11.2005 passed by the High Court of Punjab & Haryana. 3. One Ram Bux executed a Will dated 25.9.1981 in favour of the respondent herein bequeathing his right, title and interest in the property in question. Appellants claimed themselves to be the owner and in possession of the suit property which is a shop, as a co-sharer to the extent of 6 marlas out of the land measuring 3 kanal and one marla appertaining to Khasra No.53 situated in the area of Chhoti Haveli, Tehsil and District Ropar. 4. Learned Trial Court, inter alia, raised the following issues : ""1. Whether the plaintiff is owner of the suit property? OPP 2. Whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to the possession of the shop in question? OPP XXX XXX XXX 6. Whether the defendants are entitled to the counter claim to the effect that they are owner of the shop in question and co-sharer to the extent of 0-6 marlas of the land fully detailed in the counter claim? OPD"" We need not go into other issues between the parties. 5. The learned Trial Judge, although opined that the suit was bad for non-impleading Karam Kaur and Dalwinder Kaur, daughters of the testator as parties to the suit, proceeded to consider the validity of the Will in order to avoid any possibility of remand by the Trial Court, stating : ""The plaintiff was duty bound to examine at least one attesting witnesses to prove the execution of the Will Ex.P/2. It has come in evidence that Lambardar Mohan Singh expired before he could be examined as a witness. Other attesting witnesses House was alive and had been given up by the plaintiff on the plea that he had been won over by the other party. Thus, Will Ex.P/2 has not been proved according to Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act.""   of 6 6. The learned Judge, however, noticed that one of the attesting witnesses, namely, Harnek Singh @ House, according to the learned counsel for the plaintiff, had gone outside India and another attesting witness, namely, Lambardar Mohan Singh being dead, the Will must be held to have been duly proved. It was held : ""Though there is no plausible and cogent evidence on record to show that House had gone to foreign country. But even if for argument sake the plea of the Plaintiff is taken to be correct. Even in that eventuality the Sub-Registrar has only identified the signatures on the will to be that of Mohan Singh as attesting witness. Though the Plaintiff also examined PW-9 Davinder Parshad Handwriting expert who examined the signatures of the executant on the Will Ex.P/2 and the sale deed but he took all these signatures as standard signatures. The sale deeds, however, have not been proved by the Plaintiff to contain the signatures of Ram Bux. Expert compared these standard signatures with the questioned signatures on the family settlement. Therefore, there is nothing on record to suggest that Handwriting expert took the signatures of will as questioned and compared the same with admitted or proved signatures of Ram Bux. Therefore, the Plaintiff miserably failed to show that the Will Ex.P/2 contained the signatures of Ram Bux. Consequently, the Plaintiff failed to prove the due execution of the Will Ex.P/2, as per the requirement of Section 69 of the Indian Evidence Act. In result, the Plaintiff failed to show that deceased Ram Bux executed legal and valid will dated 25.9.1981 in his favour. In view of this finding I need not dilate on the argument of the learned counsel for the defendants that the Will Ex.P/2 was surrounded by suspicious circumstanced."" 7. An appeal was preferred thereagainst. The First Appellate Court, however, on the said issue held : ""Now so far as the Will Ex.P/2 is concerned, it was allegedly executed by Ram Bux Singh son of Daya Ram on 25.9.1981 and was duly got registered in the office of the Sub-Registrar, Ropar, on the same date. It is evident that this Will was attested by two witnesses, namely, Harnek Singh son of Ram Prakash and Mohan Singh, Lamberdar. So far as Mohan Singh Lamberdar is concerned, he had since died on 4.7.1983 vide death Certificate Ex.P3 and for this reason he could not be brought in the witness box. However, Harnek Singh son of Ram Parkash is alive but it is stated by Shri A.L. Verma, counsel for the Plaintiff as well as Plaintiff himself on 29.10.1999 that Harnek Singh witness has joined hands with the opposite party and moreover, he has intentionally left to a foreign country. For this reason, Harnek Singh son of Ram Parkash also could not be examined by him. Now the question arises whether the statement of the deed-writer who also knew Ram Bux Singh can be relied upon or not and whether he can be  Page 3 of 6 treated as an attesting witness or not."" 8. The High Court by reason of the impugned judgment dismissed the Second Appeal preferred by the appellant herein opining that no substantial question of law arose for its consideration. 9. Mr. Viraj Datar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, submitted that in the facts and circumstances of this case, Section 69 of the Evidence Act cannot be said to have any application whatsoever and, thus, the High Court committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment. 10. Indisputably a Will is to be attested by two witnesses in terms of Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act (Act). Indisputably, the requirement of Section 63(1)(c) of the Indian Succession Act is required for to be complied with for proving a writ. Section 68 of the Act mandates proof by attesting witnesses of not merely of execution but also attestation by two witnesses. That is to say, not only the execution of Will must be proved but actually execution must be attested by at least two witnesses. Attestation must of execution of Will be in conformity with the provisions of Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act. ’Attestation’ and ’execution’ connote two different meanings. Some documents do not require attestation. Some documents are required by law to be attested. 11. In terms of Section 68 of the Act, although it is not necessary to call more than one attesting witness to prove due execution of a Will but that would not mean that an attested document shall be proved by the evidence of one attesting witness only and two or more attesting witnesses need not be examined at all. Section 68 of the Act lays down the mode of proof. It envisages the necessity of more evidence than mere attestation as the words ’at least’ have been used therein. When genuineness of a Will is in question, apart from execution and attestation of Will, it is also the duty of a person seeking declaration about the validity of the Will to dispel the surrounding suspicious circumstances existing if any. Thus, in addition to proving the execution of the Will by examining the attesting witnesses, the propounder is also required to lead evidence to explain the surrounding suspicious circumstances, if any. Proof of execution of the Will would, inter alia, depend thereupon. 12. The Court, while granting probate of the will, must take into consideration all relevant factors. It must be found that the will was product of a free will. The testator must have full knowledge and understanding as regards the contents thereof. For the said purpose, the background facts may also be taken note of. Where, however, a plea of undue influence was taken, the onus wherefor would be on the objector and not on the offender. {See Savithri & Ors. v. Karthyayani Amma & Ors. [JT (2007) 12 SC 248]} 13. Section 69 of the Act reads, thus : ""Section 69\027Proof where no attesting witness found\027If no such attesting witness can be found, or if the document purports to have been executed in the United Kingdom, it must be proved that the attestation of one attesting witness at least is in his handwriting, and that the signature of the person executing the documents is in the handwriting of that person."" 14. It would apply, inter alia, in a case where the attesting witness is either dead or out of the jurisdiction of the court or kept out of the way by the adverse party or cannot be traced despite diligent search. Only in that event, the Will may be proved in the manner indicated in Section 69, i.e., by examining witnesses who were able to prove the handwriting of the testator or executant. The burden of proof then may be shifted to others. 15. Whereas, however, a Will ordinarily must be proved keeping in view the provisions of Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act and Section 68 of the Act, in the event the ingredients thereof, as noticed hereinbefore, are brought on record, strict proof of execution and attestation stands relaxed. However, signature and handwriting, as contemplated in Section 69, must be  Page 4 of 6 proved. 16. Indisputably, one of the attesting witnesses was dead. Our attention, however, has been drawn to the fact that a purported summons were taken out against the said Harnek Singh. Admittedly, it was not served. There is nothing on record to show that any step was taken to compel his appearance as a witness. Ram Sahai in his deposition did not make any statement that the said Harnek Singh had been won over by the appellant. He did not say that despite service of summons, Harnek Singh did not appear as a witness. In his cross-examination, he alleged that he and Harnek Singh were enimically disposed of towards each other even prior to 1991 and in fact ""since the time of his ancestors"". It was furthermore alleged that they are not on speaking terms. A suggestion was given to him that in fact Harnek Singh had come to Court on that day to which he denied his knowledge. It is only in answer to a question in cross-examination, he stated that he did not intend to examine the said Harnek Singh. Harnek Singh may be a person who had been won over by the appellant but there must be some evidence brought on records in that behalf. The learned Trial Judge, in our opinion, rightly rejected the bare statement made by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the other attesting witness had gone out of the country. Respondent himself did not say so on oath. He did not examine any other witness. He did not make any attempt to serve another summons upon him. No process was asked for to be served by the court. Interestingly, a statement was made by a counsel before the appellate court. That statement is said to have been made before the appellate court by the plaintiff himself on 29.10.1999. We are at a loss to understand how such a statement by a counsel or by the respondent himself was taken into consideration for the purpose of invoking Section 69 of the Indian Evidence Act. A purported statement, not as a witness but through the counsel, cannot be said to be an evidence. We have noticed hereinbefore that learned Trial Judge did not accept such a statement. In that view of the matter, the first appellate Court, in our opinion, committed a serious legal error. 17. In Hare Krishna Panigrahi Vs. Jogneswar Panda and Others [AIR 1939 Cal. 688], B.K. Mukherjea, J. referring to Section 71 stated the law thus : ""This presupposes in my opinion that the witness is actually produced before the Court and then if he denies execution or his memory fails or if he refuses to prove or turns hostile, other evidence can be admitted to prove execution. In the case referred to above the witness was actually before the Court and afterwards turned hostile. In this case however, the witness was not before the Court at all and no question of denying or failing to recollect the execution of the document did at all arise. The plaintiff simply took out a summons as against this witness and nothing further was done later on. In a case like this where the attesting witnesses are not before the Court, S. 71, Evidence Act, has in my opinion, got no application. In such cases it is the duty of the plaintiff to exhaust all the processes of the Court in order to compel the attendance of any one of the attesting witnesses and when the production of such witnesses is not possible either legally or physically, the plaintiff can avail himself of the provisions of S. 69, Evidence Act."" 18. In Amal Sankar Sen & Ors. v. The Dacca Co-operative Housing Society Ltd. (in liquidation) by Inspector Liquidator, Co-operative Society, Dacca [(A.I.R (32) 1945 Calcutta 350], it was held : ""As we have already stated, that proposition of law cannot be challenged at this date. In order that S.69, Evidence Act, may be applied, mere taking out of the summons or the service of summons  Page 5 of 6 upon an attesting witness or the mere taking out of warrant against him is not sufficient. It is only when the witness does not appear even after all the process under Order 16 Rule 10, which the Court considered to be fit and proper had been exhausted that the foundation will be laid for the application of Section 69, Evidence Act. The party, namely, the plaintiff, must move the Court for process under Order 16, Rule 10, Civil P.C., when a witness summoned by him has failed to obey the summons but when the plaintiff does move the Court but the Court refuses the process asked for we do not see why Section 69, Evidence Act, cannot be invoked. The other view would place the plaintiff in an impossible position when the witness is an attesting witness to the document on which he has brought the suit, and the Court refuses coercive processes contemplated in Order 16 Rule 10 Civil P.C."" 19. In Doraiswami Vs. Rathnammal and others [(AIR 1978 Mad. 78], the same principle was reiterated, stating : ""11. D. 2. 2 merely identifies the signature of Palani Navithan found in Ex. B-1 as that of his father. The mere fact that the signature of Palani Navithan is proved, in our opinion, is not sufficient to prove the due execution of the will. The evidence of this witness is relied on for proving the signature of one of the attesting witnesses and thus enable the third defendant to adduce secondary evidence regarding the due execution of the will. The evidence of D.W. 2 will be relevant only for the purposes of S. 69 of the Evidence Act. Section 69 will come into play only when no attesting witness can be found. In this case, as already stated, an attesting witness D.W. 4 has been examined and he has denied his attestation of the document. Therefore S. 69 can have no application. The evidence of D.W. 2, therefore, even if accepted, will not help the third defendant."" 20. We may notice that in Apoline D’ Souza v. John D’ Souza [(2007) 7 SCC 225], this Court held that the question as to whether due attestation has been established or not will depend on the fact situation obtaining in each case. Therein, it was held : ""13. Section 68 of the Evidence Act, 1872 provides for the mode and manner in which execution of the will is to be proved. Proof of attestation of the will is a mandatory requirement. Attestation is sought to be proved by PW 2 only. Both the daughters of the testatrix were nuns. No property, therefore, could be bequeathed in their favour. In fact one of them had expired long back. Relation of the testatrix with the respondent admittedly was very cordial. The appellant before us has not been able to prove that she had been staying with the testatrix since 1986 and only on that account she was made a beneficiary thereof. The will was full of suspicious circumstances. PW 2 categorically stated that the will was drafted before her coming to the residence of the testatrix and she had only proved her signature as a witness to the execution of the will but the document was a  Page 6 of 6 handwritten one. The original will is typed in Kannada, although the blanks were filled up with English letters. There is no evidence to show that the contents of the will were read over and explained to the testatrix. PW 2 was not known to her. Why was she called and who called her to attest the will is shrouded in mystery. Her evidence is not at all satisfactory in regard to the proper frame of mind of the testatrix. There were several cuttings and overwritings also in the will."" In the aforementioned situation, the Will was said to have not been proved. This Court therein noticed, inter alia, the decision of B. Venkatamuni v. C.J. Ayodhya Ram Singh & Ors. [(2006) 13 SCC 449] wherein the law has been laid down in the following terms : ""25. The Division Bench of the High Court was, with respect, thus, entirely wrong in proceeding on the premise that compliance of legal formalities as regards proof of the Will would sub-serve the purpose and the suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution thereof is not of much significance."" 21. We generally agree with the aforementioned view of the Calcutta High Court. Assuming, however, that even taking the course of Order XVI of the Code of Civil Procedure might not be necessary, what was imperative was a statement on oath made by the plaintiff. A deposition of the plaintiff is a witness before the Court and not the statement through a counsel across the Bar. Such a statement across the Bar cannot be a substitute for evidence warranting invocation of Section 69 of the Evidence Act. 22. For the reasons, aforementioned, the impugned judgment of the High Court as also the First Court of Appeal cannot be sustained. They are set aside accordingly. Appeal is allowed with no order as to costs","JUDGMENT: J U D G M E N T REPORTABLE CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3124 OF 2008 (Arising out of SLP (C) No.10288 of 2006) S.B. Sinha, J. 1. Leave granted. 2.

The learned Trial Judge, although opined that the suit was bad for non-impleading Karam Kaur and Dalwinder Kaur, daughters of the testator as parties to the suit, proceeded to consider the validity of the Will in order to avoid any possibility of remand by the Trial Court, stating : ""The plaintiff was duty bound to examine at least one attesting witnesses to prove the execution of the Will Ex.P/2.

The learned Judge, however, noticed that one of the attesting witnesses, namely, Harnek Singh @ House, according to the learned counsel for the plaintiff, had gone outside India and another attesting witness, namely, Lambardar Mohan Singh being dead, the Will must be held to have been duly proved. It was held : ""Though there is no plausible and cogent evidence on record to show that House had gone to foreign country. But even if for argument sake the plea of the Plaintiff is taken to be correct. Even in that eventuality the Sub-Registrar has only identified the signatures on the will to be that of Mohan Singh as attesting witness. Though the Plaintiff also examined PW-9 Davinder Parshad Handwriting expert who examined the signatures of the executant on the Will Ex.P/2 and the sale deed but he took all these signatures as standard signatures. The sale deeds, however, have not been proved by the Plaintiff to contain the signatures of Ram Bux. Expert compared these standard signatures with the questioned signatures on the family settlement. Therefore, there is nothing on record to suggest that Handwriting expert took the signatures of will as questioned and compared the same with admitted or proved signatures of Ram Bux. Therefore, the Plaintiff miserably failed to show that the Will Ex.P/2 contained the signatures of Ram Bux. Consequently, the Plaintiff failed to prove the due execution of the Will Ex.P/2, as per the requirement of Section 69 of the Indian Evidence Act. In result, the Plaintiff failed to show that deceased Ram Bux executed legal and valid will dated 25.9.1981 in his favour. In view of this finding I need not dilate on the argument of the learned counsel for the defendants that the Will Ex.P/2 was surrounded by suspicious circumstanced."" 7. An appeal was preferred thereagainst. The First Appellate Court, however, on the said issue held : ""Now so far as the Will Ex.P/2 is concerned, it was allegedly executed by Ram Bux Singh son of Daya Ram on 25.9.1981 and was duly got registered in the office of the Sub-Registrar, Ropar, on the same date. It is evident that this Will was attested by two witnesses, namely, Harnek Singh son of Ram Prakash and Mohan Singh, Lamberdar. So far as Mohan Singh Lamberdar is concerned, he had since died on 4.7.1983 vide death Certificate Ex.P3 and for this reason he could not be brought in the witness box. However, Harnek Singh son of Ram Parkash is alive but it is stated by Shri A.L. Verma, counsel for the Plaintiff as well as Plaintiff himself on 29.10.1999 that Harnek Singh witness has joined hands with the opposite party and moreover, he has intentionally left to a foreign country. For this reason, Harnek Singh son of Ram Parkash also could not be examined by him. Now the question arises whether the statement of the deed-writer who also knew Ram Bux Singh can be relied upon or not and whether he can be  Page 3 of 6 treated as an attesting witness or not."" 8. The High Court by reason of the impugned judgment dismissed the Second Appeal preferred by the appellant herein opining that no substantial question of law arose for its consideration. 9. Mr. Viraj Datar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, submitted that in the facts and circumstances of this case, Section 69 of the Evidence Act cannot be said to have any application whatsoever and, thus, the High Court committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment. 10. Indisputably a Will is to be attested by two witnesses in terms of Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act (Act). Indisputably, the requirement of Section 63(1)(c) of the Indian Succession Act is required for to be complied with for proving a writ. Section 68 of the Act mandates proof by attesting witnesses of not merely of execution but also attestation by two witnesses. That is to say, not only the execution of Will must be proved but actually execution must be attested by at least two witnesses. Attestation must of execution of Will be in conformity with the provisions of Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act. ’Attestation’ and ’execution’ connote two different meanings. Some documents do not require attestation. Some documents are required by law to be attested. 11. In terms of Section 68 of the Act, although it is not necessary to call more than one attesting witness to prove due execution of a Will but that would not mean that an attested document shall be proved by the evidence of one attesting witness only and two or more attesting witnesses need not be examined at all. Section 68 of the Act lays down the mode of proof. It envisages the necessity of more evidence than mere attestation as the words ’at least’ have been used therein. When genuineness of a Will is in question, apart from execution and attestation of Will, it is also the duty of a person seeking declaration about the validity of the Will to dispel the surrounding suspicious circumstances existing if any. Thus, in addition to proving the execution of the Will by examining the attesting witnesses, the propounder is also required to lead evidence to explain the surrounding suspicious circumstances, if any. Proof of execution of the Will would, inter alia, depend thereupon. 12. The Court, while granting probate of the will, must take into consideration all relevant factors. It must be found that the will was product of a free will. The testator must have full knowledge and understanding as regards the contents thereof. For the said purpose, the background facts may also be taken note of. Where, however, a plea of undue influence was taken, the onus wherefor would be on the objector and not on the offender. {See Savithri & Ors. v. Karthyayani Amma & Ors. [JT (2007) 12 SC 248]} 13. Section 69 of the Act reads, thus : ""Section 69\027Proof where no attesting witness found\027If no such attesting witness can be found, or if the document purports to have been executed in the United Kingdom, it must be proved that the attestation of one attesting witness at least is in his handwriting, and that the signature of the person executing the documents is in the handwriting of that person."" 14. It would apply, inter alia, in a case where the attesting witness is either dead or out of the jurisdiction of the court or kept out of the way by the adverse party or cannot be traced despite diligent search. Only in that event, the Will may be proved in the manner indicated in Section 69, i.e., by examining witnesses who were able to prove the handwriting of the testator or executant. The burden of proof then may be shifted to others. 15. Whereas, however, a Will ordinarily must be proved keeping in view the provisions of Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act and Section 68 of the Act, in the event the ingredients thereof, as noticed hereinbefore, are brought on record, strict proof of execution and attestation stands relaxed. However, signature and handwriting, as contemplated in Section 69, must be  Page 4 of 6 proved. 16. Indisputably, one of the attesting witnesses was dead. Our attention, however, has been drawn to the fact that a purported summons were taken out against the said Harnek Singh. Admittedly, it was not served. There is nothing on record to show that any step was taken to compel his appearance as a witness. Ram Sahai in his deposition did not make any statement that the said Harnek Singh had been won over by the appellant. He did not say that despite service of summons, Harnek Singh did not appear as a witness. In his cross-examination, he alleged that he and Harnek Singh were enimically disposed of towards each other even prior to 1991 and in fact ""since the time of his ancestors"". It was furthermore alleged that they are not on speaking terms. A suggestion was given to him that in fact Harnek Singh had come to Court on that day to which he denied his knowledge. It is only in answer to a question in cross-examination, he stated that he did not intend to examine the said Harnek Singh. Harnek Singh may be a person who had been won over by the appellant but there must be some evidence brought on records in that behalf. The learned Trial Judge, in our opinion, rightly rejected the bare statement made by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the other attesting witness had gone out of the country. Respondent himself did not say so on oath. He did not examine any other witness. He did not make any attempt to serve another summons upon him. No process was asked for to be served by the court. Interestingly, a statement was made by a counsel before the appellate court. That statement is said to have been made before the appellate court by the plaintiff himself on 29.10.1999. We are at a loss to understand how such a statement by a counsel or by the respondent himself was taken into consideration for the purpose of invoking Section 69 of the Indian Evidence Act. A purported statement, not as a witness but through the counsel, cannot be said to be an evidence. We have noticed hereinbefore that learned Trial Judge did not accept such a statement. In that view of the matter, the first appellate Court, in our opinion, committed a serious legal error. 17. In Hare Krishna Panigrahi Vs. Jogneswar Panda and Others [AIR 1939 Cal. 688], B.K. Mukherjea, J. referring to Section 71 stated the law thus : ""This presupposes in my opinion that the witness is actually produced before the Court and then if he denies execution or his memory fails or if he refuses to prove or turns hostile, other evidence can be admitted to prove execution. In the case referred to above the witness was actually before the Court and afterwards turned hostile. In this case however, the witness was not before the Court at all and no question of denying or failing to recollect the execution of the document did at all arise. The plaintiff simply took out a summons as against this witness and nothing further was done later on. In a case like this where the attesting witnesses are not before the Court, S. 71, Evidence Act, has in my opinion, got no application. In such cases it is the duty of the plaintiff to exhaust all the processes of the Court in order to compel the attendance of any one of the attesting witnesses and when the production of such witnesses is not possible either legally or physically, the plaintiff can avail himself of the provisions of S. 69, Evidence Act."" 18. In Amal Sankar Sen & Ors. v. The Dacca Co-operative Housing Society Ltd. (in liquidation) by Inspector Liquidator, Co-operative Society, Dacca [(A.I.R (32) 1945 Calcutta 350], it was held : ""As we have already stated, that proposition of law cannot be challenged at this date. In order that S.69, Evidence Act, may be applied, mere taking out of the summons or the service of summons  Page 5 of 6 upon an attesting witness or the mere taking out of warrant against him is not sufficient. It is only when the witness does not appear even after all the process under Order 16 Rule 10, which the Court considered to be fit and proper had been exhausted that the foundation will be laid for the application of Section 69, Evidence Act. The party, namely, the plaintiff, must move the Court for process under Order 16, Rule 10, Civil P.C., when a witness summoned by him has failed to obey the summons but when the plaintiff does move the Court but the Court refuses the process asked for we do not see why Section 69, Evidence Act, cannot be invoked. The other view would place the plaintiff in an impossible position when the witness is an attesting witness to the document on which he has brought the suit, and the Court refuses coercive processes contemplated in Order 16 Rule 10 Civil P.C."" 19. In Doraiswami Vs. Rathnammal and others [(AIR 1978 Mad. 78], the same principle was reiterated, stating : ""11. D. 2. 2 merely identifies the signature of Palani Navithan found in Ex. B-1 as that of his father. The mere fact that the signature of Palani Navithan is proved, in our opinion, is not sufficient to prove the due execution of the will. The evidence of this witness is relied on for proving the signature of one of the attesting witnesses and thus enable the third defendant to adduce secondary evidence regarding the due execution of the will. The evidence of D.W. 2 will be relevant only for the purposes of S. 69 of the Evidence Act. Section 69 will come into play only when no attesting witness can be found. In this case, as already stated, an attesting witness D.W. 4 has been examined and he has denied his attestation of the document. Therefore S. 69 can have no application. The evidence of D.W. 2, therefore, even if accepted, will not help the third defendant."" 20. We may notice that in Apoline D’ Souza v. John D’ Souza [(2007) 7 SCC 225], this Court held that the question as to whether due attestation has been established or not will depend on the fact situation obtaining in each case. Therein, it was held : ""13. Section 68 of the Evidence Act, 1872 provides for the mode and manner in which execution of the will is to be proved. Proof of attestation of the will is a mandatory requirement. Attestation is sought to be proved by PW 2 only. Both the daughters of the testatrix were nuns. No property, therefore, could be bequeathed in their favour. In fact one of them had expired long back. Relation of the testatrix with the respondent admittedly was very cordial. The appellant before us has not been able to prove that she had been staying with the testatrix since 1986 and only on that account she was made a beneficiary thereof. The will was full of suspicious circumstances. PW 2 categorically stated that the will was drafted before her coming to the residence of the testatrix and she had only proved her signature as a witness to the execution of the will but the document was a  Page 6 of 6 handwritten one. The original will is typed in Kannada, although the blanks were filled up with English letters. There is no evidence to show that the contents of the will were read over and explained to the testatrix. PW 2 was not known to her. Why was she called and who called her to attest the will is shrouded in mystery. Her evidence is not at all satisfactory in regard to the proper frame of mind of the testatrix. There were several cuttings and overwritings also in the will."" In the aforementioned situation, the Will was said to have not been proved. This Court therein noticed, inter alia, the decision of B. Venkatamuni v. C.J. Ayodhya Ram Singh & Ors. [(2006) 13 SCC 449] wherein the law has been laid down in the following terms : ""25. The Division Bench of the High Court was, with respect, thus, entirely wrong in proceeding on the premise that compliance of legal formalities as regards proof of the Will would sub-serve the purpose and the suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution thereof is not of much significance."" 21. We generally agree with the aforementioned view of the Calcutta High Court. Assuming, however, that even taking the course of Order XVI of the Code of Civil Procedure might not be necessary, what was imperative was a statement on oath made by the plaintiff. A deposition of the plaintiff is a witness before the Court and not the statement through a counsel across the Bar. Such a statement across the Bar cannot be a substitute for evidence warranting invocation of Section 69 of the Evidence Act. 22. For the reasons, aforementioned, the impugned judgment of the High Court as also the First Court of Appeal cannot be sustained. They are set aside accordingly. Appeal is allowed with no order as to costs"
52,,HAZARA SINGH & ORS.,STATE OF PUNJAB,04/02/1971,"[K. S. HEGDE AND A. N. GROVER, JJ.]","JUDGMENT: CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal Nos. 139 to 141 of 1968. Appeals by special leave from the judgments and orders dated January 31, 1968 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Criminal Appeals Nos. 653, 655 and 654 of 1967 respectively. R. L. Kohli, for the appellants (in all the appeals). Harbans Singh, for the resondent (in all the appeals). The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Grover, J.-Hazara Singh, his brothers Bachan Singh and Jamail Singh and three others Bhajan Singh, Baj Singh and Balwant Singh were tried under S. 148 of the Indian Penal Code for being members of an unlawful assembly and in prosecution of the common object of that assembly which was to attempt to murder the police party, while these persons were armed with deadly weapons Eke pistol and rifle, having committed the offence on the midnight intervening 21st and 22nd July 1964. Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh were also charged under s. 307, Indian Penal Code, while the other four were charged under s. 307 read with S. 149 of the Code for Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh having fired pistol shots at the police party with such intention and under such circumstances that if they had there by caused the death of any member of the police party they would have been guilty of murder. Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh were further tried on a charge under S. 25 of the Indian Arms Act. The learned Sessions Judge found that all the six persons were proceeding towards Pakistan in order to smuggle six bags containing 40 Kg. cardamom each. Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh were armed with a rifle and a pistol respectively and when challenged by the police party they fired shots from their weapons at the police party in their attempt to murder them in pursuance of the common object of them all and as such they were guilty of an offence under s. 148 of the Indian Penal Code. They were con 676 victed and sentenced to one year’s rigorous imprisonment on  Page 3 of 5 that count. Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh were found guilty of the offence under S. 307 of the Indian Penal Code while their co-accused were found guilty of the offence under ss. 307 and 149, Indian Penal Code, and each one of them was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years and payment of a fine of Rs. 5001. The sentences were to run concurrently. Bhajan Singh and Hazara Singh were further found guilty of the illegal possession of firearms under s. 25 of the Arms Act and were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year each. On appeals to the High Court the conviction of the aforesaid persons was upheld but the sentences of Bachan Singh, Jarnail Singh, Baj Singh and Balwant Singh were reduced to three years’ rigorous imprisonment. All the convicted persons have filed appeals to this Court (Cr. As. 139 141/68) by special leave. These shall stand disposed of by this judgment. The prosecution story was that Inderjit Singh P.W. I who was posted as Deputy Superintendent of Police P.A.P. Border, Khem Karan, had received information on 31st July 1964 that a party of smugglers would be smuggling some goods to Pakistan during the night. He organised a raiding party consisting of Sub-Inspector Ajit Singh P.W. 1,5, Agya Ram P.W. 12, A.S.1s. Darshan Singh, Nand Singh and Mulakh Raj, Head Constables Surjit Singh P.W. 3, and Ajai Singh P.W. 13. The entire raiding party was divided into four groups. Each group was headed by one of the officers including Inderjit Singh D.S.P. At about midnight the police party noticed some persons coining from the side of village Lakhna by the katcha path with some mares. The path led to Pakistan. It was a moonlit night but was cloudy at that time. It is unnecessary to go into the details which will be presently noticed of how the firing of the shots took place by the accused persons and how they were identified and arrested. Four of them were taken into custody at the spot but Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh escaped on their mares’ They were arrested later and on their disclosure a rifle and ’a revolver were recovered. No one was injured and although some empty cartridges were found but no attempt was made to find the bullets which are alleged to have been fired by the party of the appellants. The evidence of the police officers was consistent and we may only refer to the deposition of Inderjit Singh D.S.P. who appeared as P.W. 1 According to him when the culprits were at a distance of 25 to 30 karams (One karam is equal to 5 67 7 feet) he alerted members of the police party to be on their guard and directed Sub-Inspector Ajit Singh to challenge the culprits and inform them that the police party was holding its positions and they should stop proceeding further. Ajit Singh accordingly challenged the culprits. Thereupon the, leader of the party fired a shot at the police party. Inderjit Singh then ordered Sub-Inspector Agya Ram to fire a light pistol so that there might be light and it might be possible to identify the culprits. Agya Ram fired a shot and in the light that emerged the leader of the party was identified as Hazara Singh appellant who was riding a mare and who had a rifle in his hand. He was followed by Bhajan Singh or Harbhajan Singh who also was riding a mare and had a loaded, bag and was armed with pistol. He was followed by the other four on foot. These persons then shouted to their companions Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh that they should open fire on the police party. Thereupon Hazara Singh and’ Bhajan Singh started firing shots from their respective  Page 4 of 5 weapons. Sub-Inspector Ajit Singh ordered the police party to open fire in defence. Four Head Constables fired two shots each from their rifles at the culprits. At this stage Agya Ram fired another light pistol shot. Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh ran away on their mares throwing away the bags. The other four persons were found lying down on the ground. There can be no manner of doubt that if Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh fired shots at the police party and even though no one was injured the appellants would be guilty of the offences with which they were charged. The real question is whether it had been proved beyond doubt that the shots were fired at the police party. There could be two possibilities in such a situation, one could be of the shots being fined in the direction of the police party or taking aim at them and the other could be of the shots being fired in the air or in some other direction and not in the direction of the police party merely to create confusion for the purpose of running away. On the evidence of Inderjit Singh P.W. 1 himself it was a moonlit night but owing to the weather being cloudy it was dark and light pistol shots bad to be fired by Sub-Inspector Agya Ram on two occasions in order to provide sufficient light for seeing and identifying them. The light provided by these pistol shots admittedly lasted only for 2 or 2 1/2 seconds. If the shots which are alleged to have been fired by Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh had been fired,at the time when there was light as a result of the firing of the light pistol shots by Sub-Inspector Agya Ram then it could be said to have been established that the Deputy Superintendent of Police and the other witnesses could have seen in which direction the fire arms were fired by Hazara Singh and 678 Bhajan Singh and their statement could have been accepted that ,the shots had been fired at them. But from the evidence of Inderjit Singh as also of Sub-Inspector Agya Ram who actually fired the light pistol shots which provided the light on two occasions it is quite clear that the shots which were fired by Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh were not fired during the few seconds there was light as a result of the light pistol shots of Agya Ram.- In other words the shots which are stated to have been fired by the aforesaid two appellants were fired in complete darkness when it was not possible for any member of the police party to see the direction in which they were fired or the aim which was taken by Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh. It is not possible to say from this evidence that Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh fired the shoots in the direction of the police party or at them, and the possibility that the shots were fired in the air cannot be excluded. Thus the conviction under S. 307 of Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh and of the other appellants under s. 307 read with s. 149, Indian Penal Code cannot be maintained and they must’ be acquitted of that charge. It is unfortunate that the judgment of the High Court’ is very sketchy and there is hardly any discussion or examination of all the above material facts. As regards, the conviction of the appellants under S. 148 of the Indian Penal Code we find it difficult to uphold the same. According to that section whoever is guilty of rioting being armed with deadly weapons or with anything which used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. Rioting is defined by s. 146 which provides that whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly or any member thereof in prosecution of the common object of  Page 5 of 5 such assembly every member of such assembly is guilty of the offence of rioting. Section 349 gives the meaning of the word ""force"". The learned counsel for the State has not been able to show how any force or violence is proved to have been used by the appellants in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly of which they were members. With the exception of the firing of the shots in a direction which cannot be determined no attempt was made by any of the appellants to use any force or violence on any member of the police party. Consequently the conviction of the appellants under s. 148 must also be set aside. As regards the conviction of Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh under s. 25 of the Indian Arms Act it is most unfortunate that the witnesses who were produced with regard to the disclosure statements made by them and the recoveries effected at their 6 7 9 instance are of such a type that their evidence could never have been believed by any court. Lal Singh P.W. and Karnail Singh P.W. admitted that they had been joining in the police raids and had been appearing as witnesses for the police for the last 15 years. Apart from that the statements made by them were so similar particularly with regard ’to the manner in which they happened to join the investigation that their whole evidence looks tutored and unconvincing. P.W.11 Hakam Singh admitted that Pooran Singh was the son of his cousin Geja Singh and that he had been convicted-in a case of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Charan Singh, uncle of the two appellants had appeared as a witness against Pooran Singh in that case. He was obviously an inimical witness. It is again surprising that the High Court in its very sketchy judgment had made-- no mention of these salient facts and has contended itself by saying that there was nothing on the record to indicate that the appel lants had been falsely implicated. The conviction of Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh, therefore, cannot be maintained under s. 25 of the Arms Act. In the, result the appeals are allowed and the convictions and sentences of all the appellants are here by set aside. The bail bonds of the appellants who were ordered to be released on bail by this Court on July 15, 1968 shall stand discharged. G.C. Appeals allowed","JUDGMENT: CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal Nos. 139 to 141 of 1968.

If the shots which are alleged to have been fired by Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh had been fired,at the time when there was light as a result of the firing of the light pistol shots by Sub-Inspector Agya Ram then it could be said to have been established that the Deputy Superintendent of Police and the other witnesses could have seen in which direction the fire arms were fired by Hazara Singh and 678 Bhajan Singh and their statement could have been accepted that ,the shots had been fired at them. But from the evidence of Inderjit Singh as also of Sub-Inspector Agya Ram who actually fired the light pistol shots which provided the light on two occasions it is quite clear that the shots which were fired by Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh were not fired during the few seconds there was light as a result of the light pistol shots of Agya Ram.- In other words the shots which are stated to have been fired by the aforesaid two appellants were fired in complete darkness when it was not possible for any member of the police party to see the direction in which they were fired or the aim which was taken by Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh. It is not possible to say from this evidence that Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh fired the shoots in the direction of the police party or at them, and the possibility that the shots were fired in the air cannot be excluded. Thus the conviction under S. 307 of Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh and of the other appellants under s. 307 read with s. 149, Indian Penal Code cannot be maintained and they must’ be acquitted of that charge. It is unfortunate that the judgment of the High Court’ is very sketchy and there is hardly any discussion or examination of all the above material facts. As regards, the conviction of the appellants under S. 148 of the Indian Penal Code we find it difficult to uphold the same. According to that section whoever is guilty of rioting being armed with deadly weapons or with anything which used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. Rioting is defined by s. 146 which provides that whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly or any member thereof in prosecution of the common object of  Page 5 of 5 such assembly every member of such assembly is guilty of the offence of rioting. Section 349 gives the meaning of the word ""force"". The learned counsel for the State has not been able to show how any force or violence is proved to have been used by the appellants in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly of which they were members. With the exception of the firing of the shots in a direction which cannot be determined no attempt was made by any of the appellants to use any force or violence on any member of the police party. Consequently the conviction of the appellants under s. 148 must also be set aside. As regards the conviction of Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh under s. 25 of the Indian Arms Act it is most unfortunate that the witnesses who were produced with regard to the disclosure statements made by them and the recoveries effected at their 6 7 9 instance are of such a type that their evidence could never have been believed by any court. Lal Singh P.W. and Karnail Singh P.W. admitted that they had been joining in the police raids and had been appearing as witnesses for the police for the last 15 years. Apart from that the statements made by them were so similar particularly with regard ’to the manner in which they happened to join the investigation that their whole evidence looks tutored and unconvincing. P.W.11 Hakam Singh admitted that Pooran Singh was the son of his cousin Geja Singh and that he had been convicted-in a case of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Charan Singh, uncle of the two appellants had appeared as a witness against Pooran Singh in that case. He was obviously an inimical witness. It is again surprising that the High Court in its very sketchy judgment had made-- no mention of these salient facts and has contended itself by saying that there was nothing on the record to indicate that the appel lants had been falsely implicated. The conviction of Hazara Singh and Bhajan Singh, therefore, cannot be maintained under s. 25 of the Arms Act. In the, result the appeals are allowed and the convictions and sentences of all the appellants are here by set aside. The bail bonds of the appellants who were ordered to be released on bail by this Court on July 15, 1968 shall stand discharged. G.C. Appeals allowed"
53,,T. N. ANGAMI,SMT. RAVOLUEU,02/02/1971,"RAY, A.N. BENCH: RAY, A.N. MITTER, G.K.","JUDGMENT: CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 1125 of 1970. Appeal under s. 116-A of the, Representation of the People Act, 1951 from the Judgment and order dated March 1970 of the Assam and Nagaland High Court in Election Petition No. 2 of 1969. S. V. Gupte, S. K. Ghose, Advocate-General, Nagaland, Naunit Lal, A. R. Barthakar, R. C. Chowdhury and B. K. Dass, for the appellant. 660 D.P. Singh, A. K. Gupta, V. J. Francis and S. P. Singh, for A the respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ray, J. This is an appeal from the judgment dated 26 March 1970 of the Assam and Nagaland High Court declaring the election of the appellant void under section 1 00 ( 1 ) (b) of the Representation of the People Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and further declaring the appellant to have committed a corrupt practice within the meaning of section 123(6) of the Act for incurring or authorising expenditure in contravention of section 77 of the Act. The gist of the finding of the High Court is that the appellant showed in his return a sum of Rs. 900/- as election expenses after claiming a refund of Rs. 100/- but the appellant is found to have’ incurred or authorised expenditure of a further amount of Rs. 154.15 which the appellant did not include in his return and thereby the appellant exceeded the permissible limit of Rs. 1000/by Rs. 54.15. The finding of the High Court is, that the appellant incurred or authorised the expenditure of Rs. 90/- for what is described as pink identity cards and secondly incurred or authorised the expenditure of Rs. 22.65 in respect of purchase of forms and election handbooks and,thirdly incurred or authorised the expenditure of Rs. 42.50 on 18 trunk calls between 15 January, 1969 and 11 February, 1969 aggregating Rs. 154.15 which sum was not included in the return of election expenses. The appellant was at the time of the election Chief Minister of the State of Nagaland. The appellant and the respondent were two candidates at the General Election in the year 1969 to the Nagaland Legislative Assembly from No. 6 Western Angami Constituency. The polling took place on 6, 8 and 10 February, 1969 and counting of votes took place on 12 February, 1969. The appellant polled 1933 votes. The respondent polled 935 votes. On 12 February, 1969 the result of the election was declared and the appellant having secured the majority of valid votes was declared to be elected. The respondent in the election petition alleged that the appellant included in his return as election expenses the sum of Rs. 75/paid by him to Kohima Printing Press on 17 January, 1969 for printing blue identity cards but the appellant did not include in the said return a sum of Rs. 90/- by him to Kohima Printing Press on 29 January, 1969 for printing a set of pink identity cards issued by him. The appellant in his written. statement denied that lie spent IZs. 90/- for the purpose of printing identity cards that were 661 used by him in any way in his election. The appellant stated that he spent Rs. 75/- only for printing the identity  Page 3 of 6 cards which were used in the election and the same has been properly accounted for in his statement for his election expenses. Under section 123(6) of the Representation of the People Act the incurring or authorising of expenditure in contravention of section 77 is a corrupt practice for the purpose of the Act. Section 77 deals with account of election expenses and maximum thereof. The first sub-section states that every candidate at an election shall, either by himself or by his election agent, keep a separate and correct account of all expenditure in connection with the election incurred or authorised by him or by his election agent between the date of publication of the notification calling the election and ,the date of declaration of the result thereof both dates inclusive. The second sub-section states that the account shall contain such particulars’ as may’ be prescribed. The third subjection states that the total amount shall not exceed such amount as may be prescribed. The prescribed maximum for election expenses is the sum of Rs. 1,000 as will be found in Rule 90(2) of the Conduct of Election Rules. That is the sum prescribed for the State of Nagaland for State Assembly Election. For other States different amounts are prescribed as the maximum of election expenses for the State Assemblies. The relevant issue with regard to the alleged expenditure of Rs. 90 raises the question as to whether the appellant incurred or authorised the expenditure of the, said amount. On behalf of the appellant the owner of the printing press Vipikejeye gave evidence. He said that the appellant placed an order (Ex. 10) for 5000 identity cards for election and he also said that Exhibit 1 1 the blue identity cards were printed in his press. The owner of the press further said that the appellant did not personally come to place the order but his party-men came and placed the order’ The blue identity card was not found suitable and the owner of the printing press printed the pink identity card. The owner was paid Rs. 75 for printing 5000 blue identity cards. As for the pinkcards the evidence of the owner of the printing press was that the order for the pink cards was placed on 29 January, 1969 ""by the young man"" of the appellant. The owner of the press supplied the pink cards numbering 6000 and be received the sum of Rs. 90 on 1 February, 1969 and one Pralie Peseyie paid that sum and took away the pink identity cards. Pralie Peseyie was said to be a man of the appellant. There was no written order for the printing job. The owner of the press specifically said that he did not receive Rs. 90 from the appellant, 662 The appellant in his oral evidence said that the blue identity card was ordered by him to be printed and he entrusted one of his worker to do it. On his return the appellant found that there was something wrong in the blue identity cards which contained the words ’Vote for T. N. Angami’. The appellant said that he became annoyed and asked. the, person entrusted with the printing of the identity cards to, go immediately to the printing press and get the cards ""reprinted correctly"". After- that ""the man"" brought the pink identity card but he did not tell anything about the payment of such printing work and that is how the appellant did not account for them. The-appellant accounted for Rs. 75 as the cost of printing identity cards. In cross-examination the appellant was asked whether he asked Pralie Peseyie to pay the cost of the blue identity card because of the appellant’s annoyance. His answer was that he did not say anything specifically but Pralie Peseyie  Page 4 of 6 did something wrong and the latter felt shy and did not ask any money from the appellant. The appellant’s evidence was that the press submitted the bill for the printing of the blue identity card and the payment was made by, the appellant but he did not personally go and pay. In cross examination the appellant was specifically asked whether the pink identity cards were produced before him with the bill. The appellant, answered in the negative. The appellant was then asked whether before filing the return the appellant had asked from the press as to what the cost of the printing of the pink identity cards was. The, appellant’s answer was ""I bad not paid personally and the bill was not produced before me I did not enquire"". The appellant was again asked whether the amount for printing pink identity cards was paid. , His answer was that the amount was paid by Pralie Peseyie. Pralie Peseyie gave evidence on behalf of the appellant and said that the appellant was ""much annoyed"" because Pralie Peseyie without the appellant’s knowledge put the words ""Please vote for T. N. Angami"" on the blue identity cards and the appellant asked Pralie Peseyie to get the identity cards reprinted. Pralie Peseyie therefore placed order to get 6000 identity cards printed again. He said that he paid Rs. 90 from his own pocket as he felt that it was his responsibility to get the cards printed correctly. He also said that he never asked the appellant to reimburse him for that amount of Rs. 90. In cross-examination he was asked whether he told the appellant that he paid Rs. 90. His answer was in ,the negative. Pralie Peseyie further said that the words ""Please vote for T. N. Angami"" were not on the sample that the appellant gave but the witness added those words without the knowledge of the appellant. The witness was asked a direct question as to what amount the witness spent for the appellant in the election and his 663 answer was ""I paid Rs. 90 for the printing of the pink identity cards and no more"". The High Court held that the amount of Rs. 90 must have been paid to the-press by Pralie Peseyie on behalf of the appellant and therefore the expenditure was incurred by the appellant as well as authorised by him in connection with his election. The respondent in the election petition alleged that the appellant paid Rs. 90. The Representation of the People Act uses the words incuffing and authorising the expenditure. The appellant denied that he paid Rs. 90. It was never suggested to the appellant that he had authorised the expenditure of Rs. 90. On the contrary, the positive evidence of the appellant is that he was annoyed with Pralie Peseyie for introducing the words ’Vote for ’F. N. Angami’ on the blue identity cards and therefore the appellant wanted Pralie Peseyie to get the cards reprinted correctly. It is also the evidence of Pralie Peseyie that he did something wrong and he had to have it corrected. He therefore paid Rs. 90 out of his own pocket. The most significant feature in ’,he evidence is, that the bill for Rs. 90 was never produced or sent to the appellant whereas the ’bill for the blue identity cards was sent to the appellant. The manner in which the appellant reprimanded Pralie Peseyie for adding the words ""Vote for T. N. Angami"" would not necessarily involve an obligation to pay and authorise an expenditure for getting the cards reprinted correctly. If it were the fault of the press, the press would have to rectify the same. On the other hand, if the blame fell on Pralie Peseyie he would have to bear the  Page 5 of 6 brunt. The fact that the bill was not sent to the appellant shows that the fault was of the witness Pralie Peseyie The oral evidence also points to that inescapable conclusion. The High Court was in error in holding on the evidence that the expenditure for Rs. 90 was incurred or authorised by the appellant. This finding is not supported by the evidence and on the contrary it is repelled by the evidence. We cannot help observing that both the appellant and Pralie Peseyie gave evidence in a very straightforward and truthful Manner. They narrated the correct course of events. We accept their evidence and hold that the appellant neither incurred nor authorised the expenditure of Rs. 90 for the pink identity cards. It would, therefore, not be necessary for us to go into the question whether, the sum of Rs. 41.50 for trunk calls and the sum of Rs. 22.65 for purchase of forms and hand-books were incurred or authorised by the appellant. Even if those two sums of money were added, the return would not be in violation of the maximum amount of Rs. 1000/-. 664 Counsel for the respondent contended that the findings of the High Court on allegations contained in paragraph 1(a), (f) and (j) of particulars of corrupt practice mentioned in paragraph 6 of the petition were incorrect and the High Court should have held that the appellant was guilty of corrupt practice. Paragraph 1 (a) relates to a charge against the appellant of having paid Rs. 200 in cash to Dolhoutha Gaonbura of Zubra and one bag of sugar for entertainment of electors attending a function at Zubra on 25 January, 1969. Paragraph 1 (f) alleges that on 27 Janu ary, 1969 a women’s meeting was held at Daklane when it was announced that a procession would be taken out on 1 February, 1969. About 200 people mostly women formed a procession shouted slogans to vote for the appellant and the appellant asked them to vote for him and after the meeting a feast was held at the appellant’s house at which drinks were served to the people. Paragraph 1 (j) alleges that on 27 January, 1969 the appellant and his wife and some other persons came to the village Pedugei in connection with the election and held a meeting where the appellant and his wife promised 8 bundles of corrugated iron sheets for the women of Kiruphema with the object of inducing them to vote for the appellant and corrugated iron sheets were later on brought from Dimapur by a truck belonging to Mizielhouto and divided amongst three groups of people. The appellant in the written statement denied the charges. The respondent did not have personal knowledge of the feast alleged in paragraph I (a) of the particulars but three witnesses were examined on behalf of the respondent. On behalf of ’the appellant there was the evidence of Dolhoutha and Shitovi Hesso. The High Court held that the three witnesses on behalf of the respondent were interested in the success of the respondent and the three witnesses attributed statements about feast and distribution of sugar to Dolhoutha who denied the same and said that the people of the village organised the feast with their money. The High Court correctly found that the quality of evidence on behalf of the respondent was such that no reliance could be placed upon it. As to allegations of corrupt practice in paragraph 1 (f) about the women’s meeting the High Court held that there was no evidence to indicate that the. respondent or any person induced the persons present to vote or offered them food and fruit. On the contrary, the High Court found that evidence of both- sides indicated that it was customary practice in  Page 6 of 6 Nagaland to offer hospitality to the people who visit their house. It will not be correct to equate ordinary hospitality or courtesy with corrupt practice. With regard to allegations mentioned in paragraph I (j) and the distribution of bundles of corrugated iron sheets the High Court 665 held that the women’s society asked for corrugated sheets for a public cause. The ’appellant was the Chief Minister at the time of the election. It would not be unnatural for people to make requests to the Chief Minister for a public cause. It would also be reasonable to expect that the Chief Minister would try to redress grievances of the people. There is no proof of corrupt motive. We agree with the High Court that there is no proof of corrupt practice alleged in paragraphs 1 (a), (f) and (j) of the particulars dealt with above. For these reasons we accept the appeal and hold that the appellant is not guilty of any violation of section 123 (6) and section 77 of the Representation of the People Act. The judgment of the High Court is set aside. The charge, of corrupt practice under section 123(6) is set aside. The order setting aside the election of, the appellant and the declaration avoiding the election under section 100(1)(b) of the Act are both set aside. The election petition of the respondent is dismissed. The appellant will be entitled to costs. K.B.N. Appeal allowed.","JUDGMENT: CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 1125 of 1970.

On the contrary, the High Court found that evidence of both- sides indicated that it was customary practice in  Page 6 of 6 Nagaland to offer hospitality to the people who visit their house. It will not be correct to equate ordinary hospitality or courtesy with corrupt practice. With regard to allegations mentioned in paragraph I (j) and the distribution of bundles of corrugated iron sheets the High Court 665 held that the women’s society asked for corrugated sheets for a public cause. The ’appellant was the Chief Minister at the time of the election. It would not be unnatural for people to make requests to the Chief Minister for a public cause. It would also be reasonable to expect that the Chief Minister would try to redress grievances of the people. There is no proof of corrupt motive. We agree with the High Court that there is no proof of corrupt practice alleged in paragraphs 1 (a), (f) and (j) of the particulars dealt with above. For these reasons we accept the appeal and hold that the appellant is not guilty of any violation of section 123 (6) and section 77 of the Representation of the People Act. The judgment of the High Court is set aside. The charge, of corrupt practice under section 123(6) is set aside. The order setting aside the election of, the appellant and the declaration avoiding the election under section 100(1)(b) of the Act are both set aside. The election petition of the respondent is dismissed. The appellant will be entitled to costs. K.B.N. Appeal allowed."
54,,ALLOY STEEL PROJECT,THE WORKMEN,02/02/1971,"[J. M. SHELAT, V. BHARGAWA C.A. VAIDIALINGAM, J.J.]","JUDGMENT: CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 2128 of 1969. Appeal by special leave from the Award dated July 19, 1969 of the Ninth Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal, Calcutta in case No. VIII-396 of 1968. C. K. Daphtarv. Santosh Chatterjee and D. N. Mukherjee, for the appellant. S. C. Gupta, Manju Gupta and S. C. Agarwala, for the respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Bhargava, J. The appellant, Messrs Alloy Steel Project, is  Page 3 of 9 an undertaking owned, controlled and managed by a Government Company, viz., Messrs Hindustan Steel Ltd. Alloy Steel Project was started in the year 1961 and it went into production in the year 1964-65. No profit was earned at least right up to the year ’1967-68. The workmen, however, claimed bonus at the minimum rate prescribed under the Payment of Bonus Act No. 21 of 1965 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act"") in respect of the year 1965 631 1966 on’ the plea that this Alloy Steel Project was a / part of the Hindustan Steel Ltd. and could not be treated as a new establishment for purposes of section 16 of the Act. Hindustan Steel Ltd. was itself an establishment which had been in existence for a long period and had been even earning profits, so that exemption could not be granted to this Company in respect of payment of bonus under s. 16 of the Act. This claim of the workmen was resisted, by the Company on the plea that Alloy Steel Project was a separate establishment in respect of which separate balance-sheets and profit and loss accounts were maintained, so that no bonus was payable until either this Project itself earned profits, or from the sixth accounting year following the year 1964-65 when this Project went into production. The dispute between the work-men and the Company. could not be resolved amicably and, consequently, a reference was made under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 which came up before the Ninth Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal. The Tribunal held that Alloy Steel Project could not be treated as a separate establishment because, under the Act, a Company is itself an establishment, so that all units of a Company like Hindustan Steel Ltd. will constitute one establishment. Since this Project had not been earning any profits the Tribunal directed payment of bonus at the minimum rate of 4 per cent of wages prescribed by the Act. Aggrieved by this award of the Tribunal, the Company has come up in this appeal to this Court by special leave, though the name of the appellant is shown as Alloy Steel Project, because it was under this name that the reference was dealt with by the Tribunal. The main basis of the decision of the Tribunal is that ’the word establishment’ has been used in this Act to indicate a ""Company"" as called in common parlance."" It was on this view that the Tribunal further Proceeded to consider whether this Alloy Steel Project could be held to be an establishment separate from Hindustan Steel Ltd., or it had to be treated as a part of the parent establishment, viz., Hindustan Steel Ltd. In this approach, it is clear that the Tribunal committed an obvious error, as it ignored the indications which are manifest from the language used in the Act. In section 2, sub-section (15) and (16), establishments have been divided into two classes and their meaning has been defined. In clause (16), ""establishment in public sector’ is defined as meaning an establishment owned, controlled or managed by (a) a Government company as defined in section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956; (b) a corporation in which not less than forty per cent of its capital is held (whether singly or taken together) by 632 (i) the Government; or (ii) the Reserve Bank of India; or (iii) a corporation owned by the Government or’ the Reserve Bank of India. In clause (15) of S. 2, ""establishment in private sector"" is  Page 4 of 9 defined to mean any establishment other than an establishment in public sector. Thus, between these two clauses, all establishments are covered. If an establishment is in public sector, it is covered by the definition in clause (16). If the establishment is not in public sector, it will be covered by the definition of ""establishment in private sector"" in clause (15). The significant words are those contained in clause (16) which show that an establishment in a public sector hag to be owned, controlled or managed by a Government company, or by a corporation of the nature described in that clause. Obviously, therefore, an establishment in a private sector would be one which is owned, controlled or managed by a person or body other than a Government company or a corpora tion of the nature described in clause (16). In this view, an establishment cannot be identified with a company. It would be absurd to say that a company is owned, controlled or managed by a Government company or a corporation. Obviously, the word ""establishment"" is intended to indicate something different from a company as defined in the Companies Act. This is further clarify by the provisions of sub-s. (3) of section I which lays down the applicability of the Act. The Act has been made applicable to every factory and every other establishment in which twenty or more persons are employed on any day during an accounting year. Supposing a company has a factory in one premises and has another workshop entirely distinct and separate from that factory, in which the number of persons employed is less than 20. The Act itself will apply to the factory, but will not apply to the other establishment in which the number of employees is less than 20. This applicability of the Act will be independent of the other provisions of the Act. Learned counsel for the respondent-workmen relied on section 3 of the Act to urge that even the establishment employing less than 20 persons will be a part of the parent establishment consisting of the factory. Section 3 is as follows : ""3. Where an establishment consists of different departments or undertakings or has branches, whether situated in the same place or in different places, all such departments or undertakings or branches shall be treated as parts of the same establishment for the purpose of computation of bonus under this Act 633. Provided that where for any accounting year a separate balance-sheet and profit and loss account are prepared and maintained in respect of any such department or undertaking or branch, then, such department or undertaking or branch shall be treated as a separate establishment for the purpose of computation of bonus under this Act for that year, unless such department or undertaking or branch was, immediately before the commencement of that accounting year treated as part of the establishment for the purpose of computation of bonus."" It is to be noted that the principal part of section 3 lays down that different departments or undertakings or branches of an establishment are to be treated as part of the same establishment only for the purpose of computation of bonus under the Act. They cannot be treated as part of one establishment for purposes of subsection (3) of section 1 of the Act. In fact, section 3 cannot be, resorted to at all  Page 5 of 9 when the Act itself is inapplicable in view of the provision contained in section 1, sub-s. (3). It is, thus, quite clear that the Tribunal went entirely wrong in holding that simply because Alloy Steel Project is owned, controlled and managed by Hindustan Steel Ltd., it has to be treated as a part of Hindustan Steel Ltd. which is itself an establishment. Hindustan Steel Ltd. cannot be described as an establishment. The facts appearing on the record show that Hindustan Steel Ltd. has a number of. establishments. These include Alloy Steel Project besides the Head Office, Rourkela Steel Plant, Bhilai Steel Plant, Durgapur Steel Plant, Coal Washeries Project and Bokaro Steel Project. The Company, Hindustan Steel Ltd., cannot be equated with any one of these units. They are all separate undertakings, departments or branches owned, controlled and managed by one single Company and, consequently,. the point raised has to be decided on the basis whether, under the proviso to section 3 the Alloy Steel Project is to be treated as a separate establishment, or is to be treated as part of the main establishment owned by Hindustan Steel Ltd. Learned counsel for the respondent-workmen, however, advanced a new argument which was not put forward before the Tribunal. His submission was that, if an establishment of a Company consists of a number of departments, undertakings or branches, the principal part of section 3 will apply and all such departments, undertakings or branches must be treated as parts of one single establishment for purposes of computation of bonus under the Act, but the proviso to section 3 will not apply in such a case. According to him, the proviso to section 3 will apply to establishments consisting of different departments, undertakings or branches which are owned, controlled or managed by persons other 634 than companies. This argument was based on the reasoning that, in order to calculate available surplus for distribution of bonus in the case of a company the Act lays down in section, 6 (d) read with the Third Schedule that the deductions to be made from net _profits will also include dividends payable on , preference share ,capital, and 8.5 per cent of its paid up equity share, capital as at the commencement of the accounting year. This provision cannot be given effect to in respect of separate units of a Company, .because the paid up capital or the preference share capital is not ,allocated between different units. In the case of the present Company, viz., Hindustan Steel Ltd., the entire paid up capital is shown in the accounts of the Head Office. The money needed for working of the various units, including the Alloy Steel Project, is shown as remittance received from the Head Office and not as. paid up capital of the Alloy Steel Project etc. The result is that, if Alloy :Steel Project or other units of the Hindustan Steel Ltd. are treated as separate establishments and available surplus is calculated separately for each unit, there will be no deduction @ 8.5 per cent ,of the paid up equity share capital as envisaged by section, 6(d) ,and the Third Schedule of the Act. We do not think that there is any force in this argument. First, it would be a strange method of construction of language to hold that the establishment referred to in the main part of section 3 will include all different departments, undertakings and ""branches of a company, while it will not do so in the proviso to ’the same section. Such different meanings in the same section in respect of the same words or expression cannot be accepted. Secondly, it  Page 6 of 9 seems to us that no difficulty of the nature pointed out by learned counsel can arise in calculating available surplus. ’Wherever the Act lays down that certain deductions are to be made, it is obvious that those deductions will only be effective if, in fact, circumstances do exist justifying such deductions. In the ’Third Schedule itself, the first’ deduction envisaged is dividend payable on preference share capital. A number of companies do not have preference share capital. In such cases, clearly, no ,occasion would arise for making such a deduction. Very similar is the position with regard to certain other deductions which are permissible under the Second Schedule which principally lays down the method of calculation of available surplus.- There is, therefore, no reason for interpreting the proviso to section 3 in the manner urged by learned counsel simply because, in the case of separate departments, undertakings or branches of the establishment of a company, it may not be possible to make a deduction @ 8.5 per cent of the paid up equity share capital. In the present case, there is very clear evidence that, though the Company, Hindustan Steel Ltd., has a number of undertakings, 635 Separate accounts are kept for each separate undertaking. The annual reports for three years were produced before the Tribunal. They clearly indicate that separate balance-sheet was prepared for each unit and separate profit and loss account was worked out for each unit, except that, for the Head Office, though a separate balance-sheet was-prepared, the profit and loss was worked out on the basis of the consolidated accounts. The Tribunal, in support of its view that Alloy Steel Project is a part of the establishment constituted by the Company, Hindustan Steel Ltd., relied on the circumstance that a consolidated balance-sheet is prepared for the Company in respect of all its units and after such consolidation, profit and loss is also worked out for all the establishments together so as to find out the actual profit and loss earned or incurred by the Company itself. From this, the tribunal sought to infer that there were no separate accounts in respect of each unit as are required to be maintained before they can be treated as separate establishments under the proviso to section 3. The Tribunal has obviously gone wrong in ignoring the fact that separate balance sheets and profit and loss accounts are in fact maintained for each separate unit and the consolidated accounts are prepared only for the purpose of complying with the requirements of the companies Act. The Companies Act does lay down the requirement that a consolidated balance sheet and profit and loss account for all the units of the Company must be prepared and, for, that purpose, quarterly statements of accounts have to be sent by each unit to the Head Office. There is, however, no provision even in the Companies Act containing a prohibition to maintenance of separate balance-sheets and separate profit and loss statements for each unit for purposes of the Act. That accounts are separately maintained for each unit is not only established from the various annual reports filed before the Tribunal and the evidence of, the Company’s witness Umapada Chakraborty, but is also admitted by Suprakash Kanjilal, the only witness examined on behalf of the workmen. The latter also admitted that separate bonus calculation is made in respect of each unit and bonus was declared separately in each unit. No bonus was, however, declared in respect of the Alloy Steel Project. That declaration was not made because of the claim that Alloy Steel Project was exempt  Page 7 of 9 from payment of bonus under section 16 of the Act. Section 16 runs as follows: ""16. (1) Where an establishment is newly set up, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, ,the employees of such establishment shall be entitled to be paid bonus under this Act only (a) from the accounting year in which the employer derives profit from such establishment; or 918Sup CI/71 636 (b) from the sixth accounting year following the accounting year in which the employer sells the goods produced or manufactured by him or renders services, as the case may be, from such establishment, whichever is earlier Provided that in the case of any such establishment the employees thereof shall not, save as otherwise provided in section 33, be entitled to be paid bonus under this Act in respect of any accounting year prior to the accounting year commencing on any day in the year 1964. Explanation I.-For the purpose of this section, an establishment shall not be deemed to be newly set up merely by reason of a change in its location, management, name or ownership. Explanation II.-For the purpose of clause (a), an employer shall not be deemed to have derived profit in any accounting year unless (a) he has made provision for that year’s depreciation to which he is entitled under the Income-tax Act or, as the case may be, under the agricultural income-tax law; and (b) the arrears of such depreciation and losses incurred by him in respect of the establishment for the previous accounting years have been fully set off against his profits. Explanation III.-For the purpose of clause (b), sale of the goods produced or manufactured during the course of the trial run of any factory or of the prospecting stage of any mine or an oil-field shall not be taken into consideration and where any question arises with regard to such production or manufacture, the decision of the appropriate Government, made after giving the parties a reasonable opportunity of representing the case, shall be final and shall not be called in question by any court or other authority. (2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall, so far as may be, apply to new departments or undertakings or branches set up by existing establishments 6 3 7 Provided that if an employer in relation to an existing establishment consisting of different departments or undertakings or branches (whether or not in the same industry) set up, at different periods has, before the 29th May, 1965, been paying bonus_to the employees of  Page 8 of 9 all such departments or undertakings or branches irrespective of the date on which such departments or undertakings or branches were set up, on the basis of the consolidated profits computed in respect of all such departments or undertakings or branches, then, such employer shall be liable to pay bonus in accordance with the provisions of this Act to the employees of all such departments or undertakings or branches (whether set up before or after that date) on the basis of consolidated profits computed as aforesaid."" Sub-section (1) of section 16 grants exemption from payment of bonus to establishments newly set up for a period of six years, following the accounting year in which the goods produced or manufactured are sold for the first time and, in the alternative, up, to the year when the new establishment results in profit, whichever is earlier. If the Alloy Steel Project is treated as an establishment newly set up for purposes of s. 16(1), the exemption claimed would be fully justified. Section 16(2) of the Act makes it clear that the provisions of sub-section (1) are to apply even to new departments, undertakings or branches set up by existing establishments. Consequently, even if Alloy Steel Project is treated as a new undertaking set up by the-existing establishments of Hindustan Steel Ltd., the exemption under section 16(1) would be avail-able to it. The proviso to sub-s. (2) of section 16 also does not stand in the way of this claim, because there is no evidence at all that in any year, after Alloy Steel Project was set up bonus was paid to the employees of all the units on the basis of consolidated profits of all such units. The only exception has been in the case, of workmen of the Head Office where no separate profit and loss was worked out and the bonus was paid on the basis of the consolidated Profits of all the units belonging to Hindustan Steel Ltd. That, of course, was fully justified, because the Head Office was working for all the units, though as a separate unit. It was in the accounts of the Head Office that the entire paid up capital was credited and advances were made by the Head Office to the various units out of this capital or out of loans taken by the Head Office. In the case of the Head Office, therefore, the calculation of bonus on the basis of consolidated accounts was Justified; but that does not affect the principle to be applied to the separate units for which separate accounts, separate balance-sheets and separate profit and loss statements are maintained. The proviso to sub- 638 section (2) of section 16 only comes in the way it bonus is paid in any year to the employees of all the units on the basis of consolidated accounts. That has never been done in the case of the Hindustan Steel Ltd. Consequently, the Alloy Steel Project should have been treated as a separate establishment newly set up in the year 1961. It went into production in 1964-65 and did not, earn any profits at all till 1967-68. Therefore, no bonus was payable, to, the workmen of this undertaking for the year 1965-66 in view ,of the provisions of section 16(1) of the Act. The appeal is allowed, the order of the Tribunal is set aside, and the reference of the dispute is answered accordingly. In the circumstances of this case, we direct parties to bear their own ,costs of the appeal. G.C. Appeal allowed","JUDGMENT: CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 2128 of 1969.

In clause (15) of S. 2, ""establishment in private sector"" is  Page 4 of 9 defined to mean any establishment other than an establishment in public sector. Thus, between these two clauses, all establishments are covered. If an establishment is in public sector, it is covered by the definition in clause (16).

Explanation I.-For the purpose of this section, an establishment shall not be deemed to be newly set up merely by reason of a change in its location, management, name or ownership. Explanation II.-For the purpose of clause (a), an employer shall not be deemed to have derived profit in any accounting year unless (a) he has made provision for that year’s depreciation to which he is entitled under the Income-tax Act or, as the case may be, under the agricultural income-tax law; and (b) the arrears of such depreciation and losses incurred by him in respect of the establishment for the previous accounting years have been fully set off against his profits. Explanation III.-For the purpose of clause (b), sale of the goods produced or manufactured during the course of the trial run of any factory or of the prospecting stage of any mine or an oil-field shall not be taken into consideration and where any question arises with regard to such production or manufacture, the decision of the appropriate Government, made after giving the parties a reasonable opportunity of representing the case, shall be final and shall not be called in question by any court or other authority. (2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall, so far as may be, apply to new departments or undertakings or branches set up by existing establishments 6 3 7 Provided that if an employer in relation to an existing establishment consisting of different departments or undertakings or branches (whether or not in the same industry) set up, at different periods has, before the 29th May, 1965, been paying bonus_to the employees of  Page 8 of 9 all such departments or undertakings or branches irrespective of the date on which such departments or undertakings or branches were set up, on the basis of the consolidated profits computed in respect of all such departments or undertakings or branches, then, such employer shall be liable to pay bonus in accordance with the provisions of this Act to the employees of all such departments or undertakings or branches (whether set up before or after that date) on the basis of consolidated profits computed as aforesaid."" Sub-section (1) of section 16 grants exemption from payment of bonus to establishments newly set up for a period of six years, following the accounting year in which the goods produced or manufactured are sold for the first time and, in the alternative, up, to the year when the new establishment results in profit, whichever is earlier. If the Alloy Steel Project is treated as an establishment newly set up for purposes of s. 16(1), the exemption claimed would be fully justified. Section 16(2) of the Act makes it clear that the provisions of sub-section (1) are to apply even to new departments, undertakings or branches set up by existing establishments. Consequently, even if Alloy Steel Project is treated as a new undertaking set up by the-existing establishments of Hindustan Steel Ltd., the exemption under section 16(1) would be avail-able to it. The proviso to sub-s. (2) of section 16 also does not stand in the way of this claim, because there is no evidence at all that in any year, after Alloy Steel Project was set up bonus was paid to the employees of all the units on the basis of consolidated profits of all such units. The only exception has been in the case, of workmen of the Head Office where no separate profit and loss was worked out and the bonus was paid on the basis of the consolidated Profits of all the units belonging to Hindustan Steel Ltd. That, of course, was fully justified, because the Head Office was working for all the units, though as a separate unit. It was in the accounts of the Head Office that the entire paid up capital was credited and advances were made by the Head Office to the various units out of this capital or out of loans taken by the Head Office. In the case of the Head Office, therefore, the calculation of bonus on the basis of consolidated accounts was Justified; but that does not affect the principle to be applied to the separate units for which separate accounts, separate balance-sheets and separate profit and loss statements are maintained. The proviso to sub- 638 section (2) of section 16 only comes in the way it bonus is paid in any year to the employees of all the units on the basis of consolidated accounts. That has never been done in the case of the Hindustan Steel Ltd. Consequently, the Alloy Steel Project should have been treated as a separate establishment newly set up in the year 1961. It went into production in 1964-65 and did not, earn any profits at all till 1967-68. Therefore, no bonus was payable, to, the workmen of this undertaking for the year 1965-66 in view ,of the provisions of section 16(1) of the Act. The appeal is allowed, the order of the Tribunal is set aside, and the reference of the dispute is answered accordingly. In the circumstances of this case, we direct parties to bear their own ,costs of the appeal. G.C. Appeal allowed"

Mehta and K. L. Mehta, for the intervener. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Grover, J. This is an appeal by certificate from a common judgment of the Delhi High Court which disposed of a batch of 14 petitions under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The question involved is of importance and relates to the exercise of powers expressly conferred on the President by clause (c) of the proviso to Art. 311(2) of the Constitution. On 14th April, 1967, the appellant and 17 other members of the Delhi Police Force were dismissed from service. The order dismissing the appellant is reproduced below ORDER ""Whereas, you Shri Sardari Lal, Sub-Inspector, Delhi Police No. 331/D, Police Station Kamla Market, Delhi hold your office during the pleasure of thePresident, and Whereas the President is satisfied that you are unfit to be retained in the public serviceand ought to be dismissed from service, and Whereas the President is further satisfied under sub-clause (c) of proviso to clause (2) of article 31 1 of the Constitution that in the interest of the security of the State it is not expedient to hold an inquiry,  Page 3 of 7 Now, therefore, the President is pleased to dismiss you from service with immediate effect. By order and in the name of the President of India Sd/ (B. Venkataraman) Joint Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry of Home Affairs."" 463 It was common ground before the High Court and has not been disputed before us that the President had no occasion to deal .with the case of the appellant himself and the order was made by Shri Venkataraman, Joint Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry of Home Affairs. It was claimed by him that he was competent to make the order by virtue of the authority which he derived under the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 made under Art. 77(3) of the Constitution. Before the High Court, the controversy was confined to the narrow point whether the function which is to be performed by the President under clause (c) of the proviso to Art. 311(2) could be performed by the authority to whom such function had been allocated under the aforesaid Rules. The High Court negatived the contention raised on behalf of the appellant that such a function could not have been delegated by the President to any other authority. The High Court also relied on the provisions of Art. 77(2) which provides for the authentication of orders made in the name of the President. Under Art. 53(1) the Executive power of the Union shall be vested in the President and shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution. Art. 77(1) lays down that all executive action of the Government of India shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the President. Clause (3) of that Article enables the President to make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the Government of India. Chapter I of Part XIV contains inter alia the three main provision relating to the Services. Articles 309, 310 and 311 may be set out to the extent necessary. "" 309. Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, Acts of the appropriate Legislature may regulate the recruitment, and conditions of service of persons appointed, to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State : ""Provided that it shall be competent for the President or such person as he may direct in the case of services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union, and for the Governor of a State or such person as he may direct in the case of services and posts in connection with the affairs of the State, to make rules regulating the recruitment and the conditions of service, of persons appointed, to such services and posts until provision in that behalf is made by or under an Act of the appropriate Legislature under this article, and any rules so made shall have effect subject to the provisions of any such Act."" 464 ""310. (1) Except as expressly provided by this Con stitution, every person who is a member of a defence service or of a civil service, of the Union or of an all India service or holds any posit connected with defence or any civil post under the Union, holds office during the pleasure of the President, and every person who is a member of  Page 4 of 7 a civil service of, a State or holds any civil post under a State holds office during the pleasure of the Governor of the State. (2).............................."" ""31 1. (1) No person who is a member of a civil service of the Union or an all-India service or a civil service of a State or holds a civil post under the Union or a State shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed. (2) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank except after an inquiry in which he has been informed of the charge against him and given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of those charges and where it is proposed, after such inquiry, to impose on him any such penalty, until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed. but only on the basis of the evidence adduced during such inquiry (a) where a person is dismissed or removed or reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge; or ""(b) where the authority empowered to dismiss or ,remove a person or to reduce him in rank is satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded by that authority in writing, it is not reasonably practicable to hold such inquiry; or (c) where the President or the Governor, as the case may be, is satisfied that in the interest of the security of the State it is not expedient to hold such inquiry. (3) If, in respect of any such person as aforesaid, a question arises whether it is reasonably practicable to hold such inquiry as is referred to in clause (2), the decision thereon of the authority empowered to dismiss or remove such person or to reduce him in rank shall be final."" 465 These Articles have come up for consideration before this Court in several cases and in connection with diverse points’ The view that has been taken with regard to their true content, scope and inter connection and the nature of the power exercisable under them is that while Art. 3 1 0 provides for the tenure at the pleasure of the President or the Governor, Art. 309 enables the Legislature or the Executive as the case may be to make any law or rule in regard inter alia to conditions of service without impinging upon the overriding power recognised under Art. 310 read with Art. 3 1 1. The power to dismiss a public servant at pleasure is outside the scope of Articles 53 and 154 of the Constitution and cannot be delegated by the President or the Governor, to a subordinate officer and can be exercised by him only in the manner prescribed, by the Constitution. This, however, does not mean that a law cannot be made under Art. 309 or a rule cannot be framed under the proviso to the said Article prescribing the procedure by whcih and the authority by whom the said pleasure can be exercised. Moti Ram Deka etc. v. General Manager, N.E.F. Railways, Maligaon, Pandu, _etc.(1) Art. 311 contains the main safeguards for civil servants in the matter of dismissal or removal or reduction in rank-while the procedure provided in clause (2) must be followed before the dismissal or removal or reduction in rank of a civil servant can be ordered, there are certain exceptions which have been made where it is not necessary to comply with the requirements of the substantive part of clause (2) of Art. 311. These exceptions are contained in the three clauses-(a), (b) and (c) of the proviso to clause (2).  Page 5 of 7 As in the cases mentioned in the proviso, the procedure laid down in clause (2) has not to be followed and the only protection which is conferred on a civil servant cannot be availed of by him, we must look at them carefully. A dichotomy has been introduced in clause (b) and, (c) with regard to the authority or the functionary who has to be satisfied about the matters stated therein. In clause (b), it is only the authority empowered to dismiss or remove a person or to reduce him in rank who has to be satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry provided by clause (2) and his decision in terms of clause (3) of the Article shall be final. But in clause (c) it is. the President or the Governor alone, as the case may be, who has to be satisfied that in the interest of the security of the State it is not expedient to hold such inquiry. Now the argument on behalf of the appellant has proceeded on these lines. Art. 53(1) vests the Executive power of the Union in the President but Art. 77 deals only with executive action of (1) [1964] 5 S.C.R. 683 at pp. 731 & 732). 466 the Government of India. There are several Articles under which the President is required to be satisfied before an action is taken. Clause (c) of the proviso to clause (2) of Art. 311 is one, of Such provisions. The other provision which also deals with the question of satisfaction about the security of India being threatened etc. is the one contained in Art. 352 which relates to Proclamation of emergency. Art. 356 says that if the President on receipt of a report from the Governor of a State or otherwise, is satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions; of the Constitution, he may make a Proclamation as provided in the Article. Art. 360 which contains provisions relating to financial emergency also employs the language ""if the President is satisfied that a situation has arisen whereby the financial stability or credit of India or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened, he may by a Proclamation make a declaration to that effect."" The enumeration of the aforesaid Articles is merely illustrative and not exhaustive. In such cases, it is the President who has to be personally satisfied on the material placed before him about the various matters on which action has to be taken. Such functions may pertain to the executive power of the Union which is vested in him under Art. 53(1) but these cannot fall within Art. 77(1) which is confined to executive action of the Government of India. Apart from the Articles mentioned above, there are several other Articles which may also be considered in this connection. It would be han v. F. N. Rana and Others(2). ""The power to promulgate Ordinances under Art. 123; to suspend the ’provisions of Arts. 268 to 279 during an emergency; to declare failure of the Constitutional machinery in States under Art. 356; to declare a financial emergency under Art. 360; to make rules regarding the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to posts and services in connection with the affairs of the Union under Art. 309-to enumerate a few out of the various powers-are not powers of the Union Government; these are powers vested in the President by the Constitution and are incapable of being delegated or entrusted to any other body or authority under Art. 258(1). The plea that the very nature of these powers is such that they could not be intended to be entrusted under Art. 258(1) to the, State or officer of the State, and, therefore, that clause must have  Page 6 of 7 a limited content, proceeds upon an obvious fallacy. Those powers cannot be delegated under Art. 258(1) because they are not (2) 1964] 5 S.C.R. 294 at pp. 307 to 308. the powers of the Union, and not because of their special character. There is a vast array of other powers exercisable by the President-to mention only a few-ap pointment of Judges: Arts. 124 & 217, appointment of Committees of Official Languages Act; Art. 344, appointment of Commissions to investigate conditions of backward classes; Art. 340, appointment of Special Officer for Scheduled Castes and Tribes : Art. 338, exercise of his pleasure to terminate employment: Art. 310, declaration that in the interest of the security of the State it is not expedient to give to a public servant sought to be dismissed an opportunity contemplated by Art. 311(2)-these are executive powers of the President and may not be delegated or entrusted to another body or officer because they do not fall within Art. 258."" It seems to us that there is a good deal of substance in the argument raised on behalf of the appellant. On the principles which have been enunciated by this Court, the function in clause (c) of the proviso to Art. 311(2) cannot be delegated by the President to any one else in the case of a civil servant of the Union. In other words he has to be satisfied personally that in the interest of the security of the State, it is not expedient to hold the inquiry prescribed by clause (2). In the first place, the general consensus has been that executive functions of the nature entrusted by the Articles, some of which have been mentioned before and in particular those Articles in which the President has to be satisfied himself about the existence of certain fact or state of affairs cannot be delegated by him to any one else. Secondly even with regard to clause (c) of the proviso, there is a specific. observation in the passage extracted above from the case of Jayantilal Amrit Lal Shodhan that the powers of the President under that provision cannot be delegated. Thirdly, the dichotomy which has been specifically introduced between the authority mentioned in clause (b) and the President mentioned in clause (c) of the proviso cannot be without significance. The Constitution makers apparently felt that a matter in which the interest of the security of the State had to be considered should receive the personal attention of the President or the head of the State and he should be himself satisfied that an inquiry under the substantive part of clause (2) of Art. 3 1 1 was not expedient for the reasons stated in clause (c) of the proviso in the case of a particular servant. We are not impressed with the reasoning of the High Court with reference to Art. 77(2). If the function or the power exercisable under clause (c) of the proviso under consideration could not be delegated or allocated to any one else by the President. Art. 468 77(2) will not stand in the way of the Court in the matter of examining the validity of the order. For all the above reasons this appeal is allowed and the judgment of the High Court is set aside. The impugned order by which the appellant was dismissed from service shall stand quashed on the ground that it was illegal, ultra vires and void. The appellant shall be entitled to costs in this court and the High Court. G.C. Appeal allowed","JUDGMENT: CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 576 of 1969.

Thirdly, the dichotomy which has been specifically introduced between the authority mentioned in clause (b) and the President mentioned in clause (c) of the proviso cannot be without significance. The Constitution makers apparently felt that a matter in which the interest of the security of the State had to be considered should receive the personal attention of the President or the head of the State and he should be himself satisfied that an inquiry under the substantive part of clause (2) of Art. 3 1 1 was not expedient for the reasons stated in clause (c) of the proviso in the case of a particular servant. We are not impressed with the reasoning of the High Court with reference to Art. 77(2). If the function or the power exercisable under clause (c) of the proviso under consideration could not be delegated or allocated to any one else by the President. Art. 468 77(2) will not stand in the way of the Court in the matter of examining the validity of the order. For all the above reasons this appeal is allowed and the judgment of the High Court is set aside. The impugned order by which the appellant was dismissed from service shall stand quashed on the ground that it was illegal, ultra vires and void. The appellant shall be entitled to costs in this court and the High Court. G.C. Appeal allowed"

Nos. 1, 3 and 10 of 1989 and 12 of 1990. IN Writ Petition (C) No. 8209 of 1983 etc. (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India). V.A. Bobde, V. Gauri Shankar, M.K.

Mehrotra and Raju Ramachandran for the Respondents. The Order of the Court was delivered by RANGANATH MISRA, J. On 30th of August, 1988, while disposing of two writ petitions being Nos. 8209 and 8821 of 1983, this Court came to the conclusion that the entire mining operation in the Doon Valley should come to a halt. With a view to effectuating this conclusion all mining activity was directed to be stopped excepting in the case of a few for reasons indicated in that order. Several applications thereafter came before this Court for permission to remove stacked material and almost for one and a half years now, many rounds of such applications have been filed before this Court which have led to inquiries being made by executive authorities, a joint inspection by the District Judge and the District Magistrate as also separate reports from the Monitoring Committee appointed by this Court. After hearing parties in some cases the court has granted permission for removal and extended time for appropriating the mined material. On the plea that within the time given by the Court removal was not possible, fresh extensions of extended dates have also been asked for. At one stage, the Monitoring Committee reported that taking advantage of such extensions further mining was being illegally undertaken. The Monitoring Committee also pointed out that where the 74 mined material was spread over it had consolidated and grass as also other vegetations have started growing. In these circumstances, while either allowing or rejecting the appli cations for removal or extension or allowing removal under restrictions, this Court has been expressing itself clearly that the Doon Valley should be made available for afforesta tion to make good the loss that had been caused to the ecology and that work should no longer be interfered with. A fresh set of applications have now been made for permission to remove the mined material, machinery and/or extension of time for the same. This Court had called for a report on the basis of joint inspection by the District Judge and the District Magistrate of Dehradun and after the said report was received, the Monitoring Committee has made its report on the basis of this Court’s direction. A group of these applications had been heard on 12th of February, 1990, but as some other applications remained to be disposed of on the basis of the report of the Monitoring Committee which was yet to be received, no orders had then been made. The Monitoring Committee sent its report dated 6th of April, 1990, and the other group of applications which were then pending have in the meantime been heard on 26th of April, 1990. We proceed to dispose of all the pending applications by this order. We have considered the submissions with some amount of anxiety particularly as we are of the definite view that the  Page 3 of 8 Doon Valley should be left free to the planters for reaffor estation and the mine-owners should be put out in every respect of the same. Two or three aspects have, however, to be borne in mind while dealing with a case of this type. Mining was stopped by our order all of a sudden within a month from 30th of August,/988. Though fresh mining is stopped, mined material which had been appropriated by the mine-owner by his own efforts should ordinarily be allowed to be taken by him. There is no doubt that the mined materi al has been loosened from the original place by digging and even if it is allowed to be stacked, consolidation of such material is bound to take quite some time and within one year it is not likely to consolidate appropriately. The mined material has a market and with the closure of the mining operation substantially in the Doon Valley, this material seems to have been fetching good price as there is demand for the same. When mining was stopped, no compensa tion was provided and the only hope our order held out was rehabilitation. At this stage, it is appropriate to extract a portion from the letter 75 Of the Chairman of the Monitoring Committee dated April 6, 1990, addressed to the Registrar of this Court. The Chairman is no other than the Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry of Environment and Forests. He has pointed out: ""The Committee would seek the indulgence of the Court to submit to the Hon’ble Justices that the areas ravaged by these mines including the roads leading to the mine areas are in immediate need of afforestation to consolidate the soil and prevent soil erosion. Permission granted to the miners will inevitably delay the process of afforestation and will destroy any natural vegetation that has come up along the roads and the mine areas since the last monsoon. Shri David Paul (Lease No. 99) in fact broke several check dams in the process of lifting material taking advantage of this Court’s orders granting him permission to remove quar ried material. The process of afforestation of these areas cannot even be started as long as various applications of these miners for removal of material are pending before this Hon’ble Court. It is humbly submitted that this Court must, therefore, once and for all, put an end to such applica tions, in order that the Monitoring Committee may vigorously take up the task of afforestation of these areas."" We can quite appreciate the anxiety of the Monitoring Committee that initial permission and extension of time for removal has disturbed afforestation. The Monitoring Commit tee must, however, appreciate that the enthusiasm which it is prepared to exhibit has to be sobered down in the initial period by such judicial directions as are called for taking the cause of equity and justice into consideration. Even in such of the cases where permission or extension for removal would be granted now, we are of the view that the mine-owners should not be permitted to operate and the District Magistrate should set up a machinery under his control and subject to the supervision of the Monitoring Committee to enable removal. We do not propose to allow the process of removal to continue beyond 15th of June, 1990. The process of afforestation for the year would begin only by that time awaiting the onset of the monsoons. The ex lessees in whose case original or extended orders permitting removal would now be made have, therefore, to contact the District Magistrate within one week of this order and the District Magistrate would work out removal on appropriate payment from the respective areas of the ex-lessees of  Page 4 of 8 76 the extracted material as mentioned in this Court’s order of today on or before 15th of June, 1990. We make it clear that no application either for original permission or for exten sion shall hereafter be entertained by this Court and the Registry is directed by this order not to entertain such petitions. It may be that such direction may affect some one who has not been vigilant or has on account of some other difficulty or hardship been not able to remove the stacked material within his leasehold area in the Doon Valley; but taking the broad interests of the entire Valley into account such individual losses or inconveniences have to be sacri ficed and/or overlooked and equities can no longer be al lowed to be invoked. B INTERLOCUTORY APPLICATIONS IN DISPOSED OF WRIT PETTION NO. 8209 OF 1983 1. A. NO. I OF 1989 This application is by the former lessee of lease No. 16--Ved Pal Singh Chaudhary. The mine closed down on 30th of September, 1988 in terms of this Court’s direction dated 30.8.1988. The first report on the record is dated 18th of February, 1989, jointly given by the Additional District Magistrate, Dehradun, D.P. Sharma, Geologist of Dehradun and the Forest Range Officer, Mussoorie. This report indicated that limestone extracted was found lying scattered in dif ferent marble pits and also heaps of different shapes. The estimated quantity in the heaps appeared to be 11,500 metric tons. This Court permitted removal of the mined material and the report of the Monitoring Committee shows that between March and May, 1989, with extensions obtained from the Court, 11,539 metric tons have already been removed. The joint inspection report of the District Judge and the District Magistrate has indicated that there was no fresh mining in the area after 30th of August, 1988, and it appeared that the scattered material had been collected and removed while the stack has remained untouched. The present petition is for removal of the stack which is claimed to be more than 11,000 metric tons. The Monitoring Committee on the basis of the fact that 11,539 metric tons had been removed has assumed that there must have been fresh mining to justify the presence of the stack. It has also indicated in the report that there is no danger whatsoever of any scree or stacked 77 material rolling down and affecting and choking the streams. According to the Committee, giving fresh opportunity for removal would encourage illicit mining and several mine owners are likely to carry on that clandestinely. Keeping the two reports in view,-we are inclined to hold that there has been no fresh mining and the stack now found is the old one; it would not be appropriate to assume that the stack has consolidated nor is it possible that the vegetation on such a stack would grow within a year. For the reasons we have already indicated earlier we think it appropriate that ex-mine-owner of lease No. 16 should be permitted to have the existing stacked material of 11,500 metric tons removed from the leasehold area but the same shall be through the agency set up by the district Magistrate on terms of payment and the removal shall be completed on or before the 15th June, 1990. It is made clear that the removal shall be supervised by the Monitoring Committee. 1. A. Nos. 3 and 10 of 1989 and 12 of 1990 These are applications made on behalf of Punjab Lime & Limestone Company for extension of time for lifting the  Page 5 of 8 mined material lying in the first two lease areas held by the aforesaid lessee and for original permission for the lease No. 96. Under the final order of this Court dated 30th August, 1988, [1988 3 JT 787] in Paragraph 51 of the deci sion three mines including lease No. 96 valid up to 12.12. 1989 were permitted to work. Therefore, mining activity in respect of lease No. 96 must have stopped after 12th Decem ber, 1989. The joint inspection report of the District Judge and the District Magistrate indicated that 2,269 metric tons of material were lying at the face of the mine in lease No. 14/ii while in regard to lease No. 14/i there was no materi al found and the scattered scree was reported to have total ly stabilised. The Monitoring Committee has opposed removal from lease No. 14/ii by saying that permission to remove had been given and utilised. We are of the view that the peti tion in regards to lease No. 14/i should be rejected in view of the concurrent reports of the joint inspection and the Monitoring Committee that the scree has already consolidat ed. So far as 2,269 metric tons from lease No. 14/i are concerned there is no particular reason to take a different view and we direct that the same shall be removed through the machinery set up by the District Magistrate upon payment of the cost by the ex-mineowner. This removal shall also to be made prior to 15th June, 1990. Lease No. 96 closed down operations on 12th December, 1989. 5000 metric tons of limestone are claimed to have been scattered over 78 the area and reliance is placed upon the rule permitting six months’ time from the date of closing for removal of such material. ’The Monitoring Committee has reported that there was no scree lying on the leased area. It found that there is some scattered material on the surface of the mine which cannot conveniently be stacked up. Since this is the first application of the ex-lessee after the mining has been closed, we would have directed the Monitoring Committee to make a fresh inspection in the presence of the ex-mine-owner but in view of the clear report that there was no stacked material found by the Monitoring Committee and the further fact stated in the report that the scree has already consol idated even during the currency of the mining lease, we do not think it will be appropriate at this stage to permit any removal. The petition is accordingly dismissed. 1. A. Nos. 5 and 6 of 1989 This petition is by the legal representatives of C.G. Gujral who as lessee of lease No. 76. The first petition is for substitution of his legal representatives. It is allowed. So far as the second one is concerned, the legal representa tives of Shri Gujral, ex-mine-owner requests for permission for removal of the extracted mineral as also some machine parts from the leasehold area. At the instance of Shri Gujral this Court on 30.1.89 had made the following order: ""Heard learned counsel in C.M.P. for permission to remove the mining material already lying at the quarry site. Subject to the verification by the Collector either person ally or by a responsible officer that the allegation is correct, removal may be permitted. The entire stock either near the quarry or stocked in the stacking site should be removed within four weeks from the day permission is granted ..... "". It is alleged that soon after on 18th September, 1989, C.G. Gujral, original mine lessee died and his legal repre sentatives had instituted a suit. The suit has now been dismissed by a separate order of this Court and interim relief granted has also been vacated. This petition filed in  Page 6 of 8 July, 1989, seeks permission for removal of the stacked material and for permission to remove the machinery which comprises of compressors and tools said to be lying at the mine-site. The joint inspection report indicates that the mine site was not accessible. 16 Kms. pathway had been damaged and even walking was not possible. If we permit the roadway to be repaired, there is apprehension of 79 damage to the land in the locality. If the work is left to the legal representatives of the ex-mine-owner they are likely to collect material for the purpose of repair which would definitely affect the ecology. Yet there are valuable machines apart from the mined material to be collected. We leave it to the Collector and the Monitoring Committee to find out if by some convenient path or any other process by which the machinery and the mined material can be moved out. The legal representatives of the ex-mine-owner may now contact the Collector and the Monitoring Committee to find out the modality of removal and in case some convenient way is found out the stacked material and the machinery may be removed with the help of the agency of the Collector subject to the payment of the cost on or before 15th June, 1990. C.M.P. No. 18702 of 1989 This application is by the ex lessee of lease No. 31. The joint inspection report indicates that the mining was stopped on 12th March, 1985 and there has been no fresh quarrying. The report indicates: ""Under the mining faces in the slopes and in the river beds scree and fine material were seen lying and scattered. Natu ral vegetation is overgrown. Plants like ..... were grow ing. At some spots pine plants and furns were also found growing indicating that there is existence of humus and the already quarried material has compacted and settled binding the soil."" In this view of the matter it becomes difficult to entertain this petition at this stage; the petition is accordingly dismissed. 1. A. No. 4 of 1989 This application is by the ex-lessee of mine No. 17 asking for permission for removal of already extracted mineral lying at the mine site. In the joint inspection report it has been indicated that this Court had granted some time for removal. The ex-lessee had also obtained an order from the Addl. District Judge of Dehradun. The report indicated that there was no sign of fresh mining. We have taken all aspects into account and we are of the view that this application has to be rejected. 80 C.M.P. No. 18703 of 1989 This application is on behalf of the ex-lessee of lease No. 8 for extension of time for lifting of mined mineral. The joint inspection report indicates that mining in this area was stopped as early as 12th March, 1985, and ""Natural vegetation has overgrown in and around the mining faces. Considerable quarried material was lying scattered in the slopes, the quantity of which could not be ascertained or measured. The Monitoring Committee in its report dated 10.8.89 assessed that approximately 7,000 metric tons of the mining material was lying scattered in the mining area."" We have no intention to permit any meddling to unsettle the settled situation. As the mining has stopped for more than five years and the report is that there has been overgrowth of natural vegetation we do not intend to permit extension of time as prayed for. The petition is accordingly dis missed.  Page 7 of 8 C.M.P. 11756 of 1988 The two writ petition Nos. 8209 and 8821 of 1983 clearly relate to the Doon Valley and mining activity falling within the district of Tehri-Garhwal was not be the subject-matter of those two writ petitions. The CMP filed by the State of Uttar Pradesh is dismissed leaving it open to the State to agitate its contentions in regard to mining activity in Tehri-Garhwal separately. W.P. No. 151 of 1990 This is an application under Art. 32 of the Constitution asking for grant of leases in respect of five mines falling within the ’A’ category of the Bhargava Committee Report as also Category (1) of the Working Group Report to the Calcium Carbonate Manufacturers Association for carrying out limited mining activity to meet the essential and captive need of the Calcium Carbonate Industry. When the main writ petitions were pending, CMP 30707/87 had been filed for the self-same relief and it wanted to be impleaded in those two writ petitions. The application was rejected on 30th of August, 1988, by saying: ""From time to time, Civil Miscellaneous Petitions had been moved and orders were made. We do not see any justification to make any further order in such cases. All CMPs are disposed of."" Thereafter, the petitioner made another application for the same relief 81 but the Registry did not entertain it in view of the final order of 30th August, 1988. The present writ petition, in these circumstances, is not maintainable. That apart, this Court had come to the conclusion on 30th of August, 1988, that mining activity in the Doon Valley area must ultimately stop. The Court has taken into consideration the need for availability of minimum supply of the mineral in question and to make available such supply, controlled and regulated mining activity has been permitted. Mining leases are not granted by this Court and in view of the conclusion already reached that no fresh mining activity should be carried on, we see no justification for entertaining this writ petition. Contempt Petition No. 25 of 1989 There is already an order that the proceeding for con tempt is misconceived. We do not find any justification to give any further time for lifting or removal. The contempt petition is accordingly dismissed. 1. A. No. 9 of 1989 This application is by the Monitoring Committee appoint ed by this Court and the prayer is to recall the order of 19th October, 1989, and to direct the State of Uttar Pradesh to sell the material and utilise the proceeds for the pur poses of reafforestation and conservation. In view of the steps we have taken in the connected matters, no particular directions are necessary. C The only other question that is left for consideration is the recommendation of the Monitoring Committee that the payment of Rs.5 per metric ton of the extracted material fixed by this Court in 1988 should be raised to Rs.20 per metric ton. We have heard counsel for the parties. We have also perused the report and the papers produced on behalf of the lessees who are still running. We are inclined, on the materials placed, to take the view that the rate should be enhanced to Rs. 10 from Rs.5 with effect from 1st June, 1990. Since this will not have any retrospective effect the liability for such payment would be only in respect of the lessees who are running by permission of the Court given in  Page 8 of 8 the main judgment of August 30, 1988. It has been contended by some of the lessees before us that the money which has been collected on the basis of Rs.5 per metric ton has 82 not yet been utilised for plantation. We hope and trust that there is no basis for the criticism but would like to advise the Monitoring Committee to activise its steps in the proper direction. A detailed report on the afforestation scheme may now be placed by the Monitoring Committee by 30th June, 1990, for the consideration of the Court on the 23rd July, 1990. The rehabilitation scheme which has already been fur nished by the appropriate Committee should now be placed before the Court for orders also on 23rd July, 1990 R.N.J. Petition dis posed of","JUDGMENT: ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: I.A. Nos. 1, 3 and 10 of 1989 and 12 of 1990. IN Writ Petition (C) No. 8209 of 1983 etc. (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India). V.A.

Srivastava (NP), Promod Dayal, R.B. Mehrotra and Raju Ramachandran for the Respondents. The Order of the Court was delivered by RANGANATH MISRA, J. On 30th of August, 1988, while disposing of two writ petitions being Nos. 8209 and 8821 of 1983, this Court came to the conclusion that the entire mining operation in the Doon Valley should come to a halt. With a view to effectuating this conclusion all mining activity was directed to be stopped excepting in the case of a few for reasons indicated in that order. Several applications thereafter came before this Court for permission to remove stacked material and almost for one and a half years now, many rounds of such applications have been filed before this Court which have led to inquiries being made by executive authorities, a joint inspection by the District Judge and the District Magistrate as also separate reports from the Monitoring Committee appointed by this Court. After hearing parties in some cases the court has granted permission for removal and extended time for appropriating the mined material. On the plea that within the time given by the Court removal was not possible, fresh extensions of extended dates have also been asked for. At one stage, the Monitoring Committee reported that taking advantage of such extensions further mining was being illegally undertaken. The Monitoring Committee also pointed out that where the 74 mined material was spread over it had consolidated and grass as also other vegetations have started growing. In these circumstances, while either allowing or rejecting the appli cations for removal or extension or allowing removal under restrictions, this Court has been expressing itself clearly that the Doon Valley should be made available for afforesta tion to make good the loss that had been caused to the ecology and that work should no longer be interfered with. A fresh set of applications have now been made for permission to remove the mined material, machinery and/or extension of time for the same. This Court had called for a report on the basis of joint inspection by the District Judge and the District Magistrate of Dehradun and after the said report was received, the Monitoring Committee has made its report on the basis of this Court’s direction. A group of these applications had been heard on 12th of February, 1990, but as some other applications remained to be disposed of on the basis of the report of the Monitoring Committee which was yet to be received, no orders had then been made. The Monitoring Committee sent its report dated 6th of April, 1990, and the other group of applications which were then pending have in the meantime been heard on 26th of April, 1990. We proceed to dispose of all the pending applications by this order. We have considered the submissions with some amount of anxiety particularly as we are of the definite view that the  Page 3 of 8 Doon Valley should be left free to the planters for reaffor estation and the mine-owners should be put out in every respect of the same. Two or three aspects have, however, to be borne in mind while dealing with a case of this type. Mining was stopped by our order all of a sudden within a month from 30th of August,/988. Though fresh mining is stopped, mined material which had been appropriated by the mine-owner by his own efforts should ordinarily be allowed to be taken by him. There is no doubt that the mined materi al has been loosened from the original place by digging and even if it is allowed to be stacked, consolidation of such material is bound to take quite some time and within one year it is not likely to consolidate appropriately. The mined material has a market and with the closure of the mining operation substantially in the Doon Valley, this material seems to have been fetching good price as there is demand for the same. When mining was stopped, no compensa tion was provided and the only hope our order held out was rehabilitation. At this stage, it is appropriate to extract a portion from the letter 75 Of the Chairman of the Monitoring Committee dated April 6, 1990, addressed to the Registrar of this Court. The Chairman is no other than the Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry of Environment and Forests. He has pointed out: ""The Committee would seek the indulgence of the Court to submit to the Hon’ble Justices that the areas ravaged by these mines including the roads leading to the mine areas are in immediate need of afforestation to consolidate the soil and prevent soil erosion. Permission granted to the miners will inevitably delay the process of afforestation and will destroy any natural vegetation that has come up along the roads and the mine areas since the last monsoon. Shri David Paul (Lease No. 99) in fact broke several check dams in the process of lifting material taking advantage of this Court’s orders granting him permission to remove quar ried material. The process of afforestation of these areas cannot even be started as long as various applications of these miners for removal of material are pending before this Hon’ble Court. It is humbly submitted that this Court must, therefore, once and for all, put an end to such applica tions, in order that the Monitoring Committee may vigorously take up the task of afforestation of these areas."" We can quite appreciate the anxiety of the Monitoring Committee that initial permission and extension of time for removal has disturbed afforestation. The Monitoring Commit tee must, however, appreciate that the enthusiasm which it is prepared to exhibit has to be sobered down in the initial period by such judicial directions as are called for taking the cause of equity and justice into consideration. Even in such of the cases where permission or extension for removal would be granted now, we are of the view that the mine-owners should not be permitted to operate and the District Magistrate should set up a machinery under his control and subject to the supervision of the Monitoring Committee to enable removal. We do not propose to allow the process of removal to continue beyond 15th of June, 1990. The process of afforestation for the year would begin only by that time awaiting the onset of the monsoons. The ex lessees in whose case original or extended orders permitting removal would now be made have, therefore, to contact the District Magistrate within one week of this order and the District Magistrate would work out removal on appropriate payment from the respective areas of the ex-lessees of  Page 4 of 8 76 the extracted material as mentioned in this Court’s order of today on or before 15th of June, 1990. We make it clear that no application either for original permission or for exten sion shall hereafter be entertained by this Court and the Registry is directed by this order not to entertain such petitions. It may be that such direction may affect some one who has not been vigilant or has on account of some other difficulty or hardship been not able to remove the stacked material within his leasehold area in the Doon Valley; but taking the broad interests of the entire Valley into account such individual losses or inconveniences have to be sacri ficed and/or overlooked and equities can no longer be al lowed to be invoked. B INTERLOCUTORY APPLICATIONS IN DISPOSED OF WRIT PETTION NO. 8209 OF 1983 1. A. NO. I OF 1989 This application is by the former lessee of lease No. 16--Ved Pal Singh Chaudhary. The mine closed down on 30th of September, 1988 in terms of this Court’s direction dated 30.8.1988. The first report on the record is dated 18th of February, 1989, jointly given by the Additional District Magistrate, Dehradun, D.P. Sharma, Geologist of Dehradun and the Forest Range Officer, Mussoorie. This report indicated that limestone extracted was found lying scattered in dif ferent marble pits and also heaps of different shapes. The estimated quantity in the heaps appeared to be 11,500 metric tons. This Court permitted removal of the mined material and the report of the Monitoring Committee shows that between March and May, 1989, with extensions obtained from the Court, 11,539 metric tons have already been removed. The joint inspection report of the District Judge and the District Magistrate has indicated that there was no fresh mining in the area after 30th of August, 1988, and it appeared that the scattered material had been collected and removed while the stack has remained untouched. The present petition is for removal of the stack which is claimed to be more than 11,000 metric tons. The Monitoring Committee on the basis of the fact that 11,539 metric tons had been removed has assumed that there must have been fresh mining to justify the presence of the stack. It has also indicated in the report that there is no danger whatsoever of any scree or stacked 77 material rolling down and affecting and choking the streams. According to the Committee, giving fresh opportunity for removal would encourage illicit mining and several mine owners are likely to carry on that clandestinely. Keeping the two reports in view,-we are inclined to hold that there has been no fresh mining and the stack now found is the old one; it would not be appropriate to assume that the stack has consolidated nor is it possible that the vegetation on such a stack would grow within a year. For the reasons we have already indicated earlier we think it appropriate that ex-mine-owner of lease No. 16 should be permitted to have the existing stacked material of 11,500 metric tons removed from the leasehold area but the same shall be through the agency set up by the district Magistrate on terms of payment and the removal shall be completed on or before the 15th June, 1990. It is made clear that the removal shall be supervised by the Monitoring Committee. 1. A. Nos. 3 and 10 of 1989 and 12 of 1990 These are applications made on behalf of Punjab Lime & Limestone Company for extension of time for lifting the  Page 5 of 8 mined material lying in the first two lease areas held by the aforesaid lessee and for original permission for the lease No. 96. Under the final order of this Court dated 30th August, 1988, [1988 3 JT 787] in Paragraph 51 of the deci sion three mines including lease No. 96 valid up to 12.12. 1989 were permitted to work. Therefore, mining activity in respect of lease No. 96 must have stopped after 12th Decem ber, 1989. The joint inspection report of the District Judge and the District Magistrate indicated that 2,269 metric tons of material were lying at the face of the mine in lease No. 14/ii while in regard to lease No. 14/i there was no materi al found and the scattered scree was reported to have total ly stabilised. The Monitoring Committee has opposed removal from lease No. 14/ii by saying that permission to remove had been given and utilised. We are of the view that the peti tion in regards to lease No. 14/i should be rejected in view of the concurrent reports of the joint inspection and the Monitoring Committee that the scree has already consolidat ed. So far as 2,269 metric tons from lease No. 14/i are concerned there is no particular reason to take a different view and we direct that the same shall be removed through the machinery set up by the District Magistrate upon payment of the cost by the ex-mineowner. This removal shall also to be made prior to 15th June, 1990. Lease No. 96 closed down operations on 12th December, 1989. 5000 metric tons of limestone are claimed to have been scattered over 78 the area and reliance is placed upon the rule permitting six months’ time from the date of closing for removal of such material. ’The Monitoring Committee has reported that there was no scree lying on the leased area. It found that there is some scattered material on the surface of the mine which cannot conveniently be stacked up. Since this is the first application of the ex-lessee after the mining has been closed, we would have directed the Monitoring Committee to make a fresh inspection in the presence of the ex-mine-owner but in view of the clear report that there was no stacked material found by the Monitoring Committee and the further fact stated in the report that the scree has already consol idated even during the currency of the mining lease, we do not think it will be appropriate at this stage to permit any removal. The petition is accordingly dismissed. 1. A. Nos. 5 and 6 of 1989 This petition is by the legal representatives of C.G. Gujral who as lessee of lease No. 76. The first petition is for substitution of his legal representatives. It is allowed. So far as the second one is concerned, the legal representa tives of Shri Gujral, ex-mine-owner requests for permission for removal of the extracted mineral as also some machine parts from the leasehold area. At the instance of Shri Gujral this Court on 30.1.89 had made the following order: ""Heard learned counsel in C.M.P. for permission to remove the mining material already lying at the quarry site. Subject to the verification by the Collector either person ally or by a responsible officer that the allegation is correct, removal may be permitted. The entire stock either near the quarry or stocked in the stacking site should be removed within four weeks from the day permission is granted ..... "". It is alleged that soon after on 18th September, 1989, C.G. Gujral, original mine lessee died and his legal repre sentatives had instituted a suit. The suit has now been dismissed by a separate order of this Court and interim relief granted has also been vacated. This petition filed in  Page 6 of 8 July, 1989, seeks permission for removal of the stacked material and for permission to remove the machinery which comprises of compressors and tools said to be lying at the mine-site. The joint inspection report indicates that the mine site was not accessible. 16 Kms. pathway had been damaged and even walking was not possible. If we permit the roadway to be repaired, there is apprehension of 79 damage to the land in the locality. If the work is left to the legal representatives of the ex-mine-owner they are likely to collect material for the purpose of repair which would definitely affect the ecology. Yet there are valuable machines apart from the mined material to be collected. We leave it to the Collector and the Monitoring Committee to find out if by some convenient path or any other process by which the machinery and the mined material can be moved out. The legal representatives of the ex-mine-owner may now contact the Collector and the Monitoring Committee to find out the modality of removal and in case some convenient way is found out the stacked material and the machinery may be removed with the help of the agency of the Collector subject to the payment of the cost on or before 15th June, 1990. C.M.P. No. 18702 of 1989 This application is by the ex lessee of lease No. 31. The joint inspection report indicates that the mining was stopped on 12th March, 1985 and there has been no fresh quarrying. The report indicates: ""Under the mining faces in the slopes and in the river beds scree and fine material were seen lying and scattered. Natu ral vegetation is overgrown. Plants like ..... were grow ing. At some spots pine plants and furns were also found growing indicating that there is existence of humus and the already quarried material has compacted and settled binding the soil."" In this view of the matter it becomes difficult to entertain this petition at this stage; the petition is accordingly dismissed. 1. A. No. 4 of 1989 This application is by the ex-lessee of mine No. 17 asking for permission for removal of already extracted mineral lying at the mine site. In the joint inspection report it has been indicated that this Court had granted some time for removal. The ex-lessee had also obtained an order from the Addl. District Judge of Dehradun. The report indicated that there was no sign of fresh mining. We have taken all aspects into account and we are of the view that this application has to be rejected. 80 C.M.P. No. 18703 of 1989 This application is on behalf of the ex-lessee of lease No. 8 for extension of time for lifting of mined mineral. The joint inspection report indicates that mining in this area was stopped as early as 12th March, 1985, and ""Natural vegetation has overgrown in and around the mining faces. Considerable quarried material was lying scattered in the slopes, the quantity of which could not be ascertained or measured. The Monitoring Committee in its report dated 10.8.89 assessed that approximately 7,000 metric tons of the mining material was lying scattered in the mining area."" We have no intention to permit any meddling to unsettle the settled situation. As the mining has stopped for more than five years and the report is that there has been overgrowth of natural vegetation we do not intend to permit extension of time as prayed for. The petition is accordingly dis missed.  Page 7 of 8 C.M.P. 11756 of 1988 The two writ petition Nos. 8209 and 8821 of 1983 clearly relate to the Doon Valley and mining activity falling within the district of Tehri-Garhwal was not be the subject-matter of those two writ petitions. The CMP filed by the State of Uttar Pradesh is dismissed leaving it open to the State to agitate its contentions in regard to mining activity in Tehri-Garhwal separately. W.P. No. 151 of 1990 This is an application under Art. 32 of the Constitution asking for grant of leases in respect of five mines falling within the ’A’ category of the Bhargava Committee Report as also Category (1) of the Working Group Report to the Calcium Carbonate Manufacturers Association for carrying out limited mining activity to meet the essential and captive need of the Calcium Carbonate Industry. When the main writ petitions were pending, CMP 30707/87 had been filed for the self-same relief and it wanted to be impleaded in those two writ petitions. The application was rejected on 30th of August, 1988, by saying: ""From time to time, Civil Miscellaneous Petitions had been moved and orders were made. We do not see any justification to make any further order in such cases. All CMPs are disposed of."" Thereafter, the petitioner made another application for the same relief 81 but the Registry did not entertain it in view of the final order of 30th August, 1988. The present writ petition, in these circumstances, is not maintainable. That apart, this Court had come to the conclusion on 30th of August, 1988, that mining activity in the Doon Valley area must ultimately stop. The Court has taken into consideration the need for availability of minimum supply of the mineral in question and to make available such supply, controlled and regulated mining activity has been permitted. Mining leases are not granted by this Court and in view of the conclusion already reached that no fresh mining activity should be carried on, we see no justification for entertaining this writ petition. Contempt Petition No. 25 of 1989 There is already an order that the proceeding for con tempt is misconceived. We do not find any justification to give any further time for lifting or removal. The contempt petition is accordingly dismissed. 1. A. No. 9 of 1989 This application is by the Monitoring Committee appoint ed by this Court and the prayer is to recall the order of 19th October, 1989, and to direct the State of Uttar Pradesh to sell the material and utilise the proceeds for the pur poses of reafforestation and conservation. In view of the steps we have taken in the connected matters, no particular directions are necessary. C The only other question that is left for consideration is the recommendation of the Monitoring Committee that the payment of Rs.5 per metric ton of the extracted material fixed by this Court in 1988 should be raised to Rs.20 per metric ton. We have heard counsel for the parties. We have also perused the report and the papers produced on behalf of the lessees who are still running. We are inclined, on the materials placed, to take the view that the rate should be enhanced to Rs. 10 from Rs.5 with effect from 1st June, 1990. Since this will not have any retrospective effect the liability for such payment would be only in respect of the lessees who are running by permission of the Court given in  Page 8 of 8 the main judgment of August 30, 1988. It has been contended by some of the lessees before us that the money which has been collected on the basis of Rs.5 per metric ton has 82 not yet been utilised for plantation. We hope and trust that there is no basis for the criticism but would like to advise the Monitoring Committee to activise its steps in the proper direction. A detailed report on the afforestation scheme may now be placed by the Monitoring Committee by 30th June, 1990, for the consideration of the Court on the 23rd July, 1990. The rehabilitation scheme which has already been fur nished by the appropriate Committee should now be placed before the Court for orders also on 23rd July, 1990 R.N.J. Petition dis posed of"

Jain and Chandran--Petitioner in person for the appearing parties. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SAWANT, J. In all these cases the relief claimed is the implementation of the recommendations of the High Power Pay Committee in respect of the emoluments to be paid to the officers belonging to Class-I and Class-II service employed in different public sector enterprises. 2. Earlier, these employees had approached various High Courts and this Court against the decision of the Central Government to switch them over to the Industrial Dearness Allowance pattern and the incidental steps taken to enforce the said decision. The main reliefs claimed in those peti tions were that (i) the employees should be permitted to continue to draw the salary in the scales of pay applicable to them along with the Central Dearness Allowance, (ii) they should be granted all the benefits of pay revision and revision of other allowances which may be announced from time to time by the Central Government for its employees, and (iii) there should be no discrimination between them and those directly-employed by the Central Government and that they should get the same scales of pay and 1008 allowances for the same types of jobs in accordance with the principle of ""equal pay for equal work"". During the course of the hearing, on August 24, 1984, this Court ordered the payment of three additional dearness allowance instalments from August 1, 1983, October 1, 1983 and November 1, 1983 to those employees who were on Central pattern of pay-scales and dearness allowance subject to an individual undertaking by each employee that in case such payment resulted in the employee receiving an excess, such excess would be recovered from him from future payments, if the petitions failed. On February 19, 1986, the Court further ordered that all employees of public sector enterprises following the Central dearness allowance pattern and drawing a basic pay of Rs. 1000 or less, will be entitled to interim reliefs on the same basis and scale as the Government of India employees w.e.f. January 1, 1986. This was also allowed subject to similar undertaking given by each employee. When the matters were posted for hearing on March 14, 1986, the Central Government expressed its willingness to refer to High Power Pay Committee the question regarding the revision of payscales, additional dearness allowance, com pensatory and other allowances and such other incidental aspects relating to the employees governed by the Central pattern of pay-scales and dearness allowance. Accordingly, the Court directed the Central Government to constitute a High Power Pay Committee to go into various aspects relating to pay-scales and other incidental matters including interim relief to the said employees, viz., the employees governed by the Central Government pattern of pay-scales and dearness allowance. The terms of reference of the High Power Pay Committee were as follows:  Page 3 of 4 ""I. To examine the present structure of emoluments and conditions of service taking into account the total packet of benefits in cash and kind, available to the workers, clerical staff, supervisors and officers, below the Board level following the Central DA pattern and to suggest changes which may be desirable and feasible. II. To examine the variety of allowances and benefits in kind that are presently available to the above noted employ ees in addition to pay and DA and suggest rationalisation, simplification thereof with a view to promoting efficiency. 1009 III. To examine matters relating to grant of interim relief to the employees of all such public enterprises (belonging to the Government of India and following the Central DA pattern) who are drawing basic pay above Rs. 1000 per month and grant necessary relief to them, if called for. IV. While making recommendations on the above points, the Committee would keep in view other related factors such as scales of pay, DA and allowances prevailing in other public sector undertakings on Industrial DA formula, economic conditions in the country, resources available at the dis posal of these public enterprises"". 3. The Committee submitted its recommendations by its Final Report of November 2, 1988. However, the Central Government did not act on the said report expeditiously and hence the present writ petitions were filed on various dates praying for relief in the form of a direction to the Central Government to implement the recommendations made in the Report. The Government took several adjournments to disclose its stand on the Report and has now ultimately come out with proposals which are incorporated in the additional affidavit dated 17th April, 1990, filed on behalf of the Union of India by Shri Suresh Kumar, Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Industry, Bureau of Public Enterprises. The affidavit is taken on record. We heard the parties on the proposals contained in the affidavit and found that there was not much controversy over the proposals except in regard to the date of the implemen tation of the House Rent Allowance. The employees insisted that the said allowance should be given from 1.1. 1986 whereas the Government contended that it can properly be implemented only w.e.f. January 1, 1989, since the Report was of 2nd November, 1988. We, however, direct as follows: (i) The scales of pay and dearness allowance as recommended in the Report will be extended to those employees who have been appointed with specific terms and conditions for grant of Central D.A. This will be equally applicable to the employees who by rules laid down by the public sector enter prises are being paid Central dearness allowance. (ii) The employees appointed on or after January 1, 1989, will be governed by such pay-scales and allowances as may be decided by the Government in its discretion. Those appointed earlier 1010 with IDA pattern will continue to be governed in accordance with the terms and conditions of their appointment. (iii) The pay revision for those employees in respect of whom the recommendations are hereby being directed to be implemented hereafter, will take place only as and when similar changes are effected for the Central Government employees. These employees will, however, continue to enjoy the option to switch over to the IDA pattern of the scales of pay etc. on a voluntary basis. (iv) The various recommendations made in the Report will be implemented with effect from the dates as follows.

(J)","JUDGMENT: CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 2485 of 1989. From the Judgment and Order dated 12.12.1989 of the Delhi High Court in C.W.P. 589 of 1989. Harjinder Singh and R.N. Joshi for the Petitioner. Soli J. Sorabjee, P.K. Goswamy, Udai Lalit, C.V.S. Rao, P. Parmeshwaran and Sushma Suri for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by  Page 3 of 8 REDDY, J. This is a petition under Article 136 of the Constitution of India against the judgment and order of the High Court of Delhi dismissing the writ petition filed on behalf of the detenu challenging the detention. Notice was given and after hearing counsel for both the parties at length the matter is being disposed of at the admission stage. The detenu was detained under Section 3(1) of the Con servation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (hereinafter referred to as ’the Act’) by an order dated 13.7.89. On 7.6.89 Officers of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, New Delhi intercepted a Maruti Car in which one Mahesh Kumar Chauhan and three others were present but no recovery was effected on the spot. But later on the Car was thoroughly rummaged in presence of two independent witnesses and the occupants of the car and 206 foreign marked gold biscuits of ten tolas each were recovered from the cavities of the car meant for fitting speakers in the rear portion of the car. The occupants did not give any explanation for the possession of gold biscuits. On personal search of Mahesh, a slip was recovered which contained a telephone number and Mahesh Kumar in his statement admitted that he was to hand over the smuggled goods to one Vijay Kumar. The premises of these two peoples were searched and a receipt of token tax in respect of the car was recovered. Mahesh Kumar admitted that he was visiting Dubai frequently to bring con 320 sumer goods and gold ornaments for being sold in the local market. One Avtar Singh who was engaged in smuggling of foreign gold biscuits, agreed to sell the gold biscuits to Mahesh Kumar on commission. He also gave some more details about Avtar Singh. Similarly Vijay Kumar also made a state ment. From these statements it is also revealed that peti tioner herein Sanjeev Kumar Aggarwal had made arrangements for selling the gold biscuits. The residential premises of the petitioner was searched and he was taken into custody. The officers of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence questioned the petitioner and he gave a statement. On the basis of this material the detaining authority passed an order of detention on 13.7.89 and the same was served on 24.7.89. The grounds were also served in time. The learned counsel submitted that there is a total non-application of mind by the detaining authority inasmuch as he was failed to note that the detenu was in jail and that there is no possibility of his being released and the failure on the part of the detaining authority to consider the same renders the detention invalid. It is true that the petitioner was in judicial custody in connection with crimi nal proceedings. An application was filed in the court of A.C.M.M. Delhi for extending the remand and the remand was granted upto 6.7.89. However, two detenus who figured as co-accused in that criminal proceedings were also in the judicial custody and on their behalf an application for bail was filed. As mentioned in the grounds of detention the detaining authority has noted these circumstances. In para graph No. 16 it is mentioned that: ’I am aware that all of you are under judicial custody and possibility of your release on bail in near future cannot be ruled out. Also nothing prevents Mahesh Kumar Chauhan, Vijay Kumar Dharne and you from moving bail application and get ting release on bail."" Then in paragraph No. 24 it is mentioned thus: ""From the foregoing facts and circumstances and statements recorded in this connection as disclosed herein above, it is  Page 4 of 8 evident that you have engaged yourself in abetting the smuggling of goods unless prevented you will continue to do so in similar manner or otherwise in future when released on bail."" The further submission of the learned counsel is that the petitioner 321 alongwith two others were in judicial custody and they were further remanded upto 20.7.1989 and no bail application was filed or pending as on the date of passing orders of deten tion. Therefore it must necessarily be inferred that there is no awareness on the detaining authority of this aspect. Reliance is placed on some of the decisions of  in this context. In Abdul Razak Abdul Wahab Sheikh v.S.N. Sinha, Commis sioner of Police, Ahmadabad and Anr., [1989] 2 SCC 222 it is held that there must be awareness in the mind of the detain ing authority that the detenu is in custody at the time of service of order of detention and that cogent and relevant material and fresh facts have been disclosed necessitating making of an order of detention. In the course of the judg ment it is noted that the detaining authority also was not aware that application for bail filed on behalf of the detenu was rejected by the designated court and therefore, there was no application of mind. In Binod Singh v. District Magistrate, Dhanbad, [1986] 4 SCC 4 16 it is laid down ""If a man is in custody and there is no imminent possibility of his being released, the power of preventive detention should not be exercised. In the instant case when the actual order of detention was served upon the detenu, the detenu was in jail. There is no indica tion that this factor or the question that the said detenu might be released or that there was such a possibility of his release, was taken into consideration by the detaining authority properly and seriously before the service of the order."" In Vijay Kumar v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, [1982] 2 SCC 43 the detention order was quashed because it did not give the slightest indication that the detaining authority was aware that the detenu was already in jail. But in the case before us the detaining authority has noted in the grounds that the petitioner alongwith other two coaccused have been remanded to judicial custody and the bail applica tion was filed on behalf of the other two detenues and there is every likelihood of the petitioner also being released on bail and as such the possibility cannot be ruled out. The other material relied upon by the detaining authority in apprehending that the detenus are likely to be released on bail is that their remand to the judicial custody was upto 20.7.89 and that the other two co-accused have also filed bail applications and they were pending and that this mate rial is sufficient to indicate that petitioner also may file bail application and is likely to be released on bail. 322 We have carefully examined the material relied upon by the detaining authority in this regard and we are of the opinion that it cannot be said that there was no awareness in the mind of the detaining authority about the detenu being in custody and that if he is released on bail he is likely to indulge in the prejudicial activities. At this juncture we may also notice another decision of the Supreme Court. In Ramakrishna Rawat v. District Magistrate, Jabal pur, [1975] 4 SCC 164, the detention order was upheld since the custody was obviously of a short duration and on the basis of the antecedent activities of the detenu in the  Page 5 of 8 proximate past, the detaining authority could reasonably reach its subjective satisfaction in respect of the detenu that he was in custody. The learned counsel, however, submitted that in case the bail application is filed, the same can be opposed or even if enlarged the same can be questioned in a higher court and that a mere bald statement that the person would repeat his criminal activities after release would not be enough. In Smt. Shashi Aggarwal v. State of U.P. and Ors., [1988] 1 SCC 436 it is observed: ""The possibility of the court granting bail may not be sufficient. Nor a bald statement that the person would repeat his criminal activities would be enough. There must also be credible information or cogent reasons apparent on the record that the detenu, if enlarged on bail, would act prejudicially to the interest of public order."" This is a case of detention on the ground of likelihood of disruption of public order by the detenu. The detention order shows that the order had been made only on the sole ground that the detenu was trying to come out on bail. Learned counsel also relied upon the decision in Ramesh Yadav v. District Magistrate, Etah & Ors., [1985] 4 SCC 232 wherein it is observed: ""Merely on the ground that an accused in detention as an under trial prisoner was likely to get bail, an order of detention under the National Security Act should not ordi narily be passed. If the apprehension of the detaining authority was true, the bail application had to be opposed and in case bail was granted, challenge against that order in the higher forum had to be raised."" 323 But as already held in the instant case the detaining au thority was not only aware that the detenu was in jail but also noted the circumstances on the basis of which he was satisfied that the detenu was likely to come out on bail and continue to engage himself in the smuggling of goods. There fore the detention was not ordered on the mere ground that he is likely to be released on bail but on the ground that the detaining authority was satisfied that the detenu was likely to indulge in the same activities if released on bail. At this stage it is useful to refer to another impor tant decision rendered by the Constitution Bench in Ramesh war Shaw v. District Magistrate, Burdwan, AIR 1964 SC 334, wherein the detention order was served while the detenu was in custody. The detenu was in jail by virtue of a remand order. The Constitution Bench considered the effect of the detenU’s subsisting ’ detention and it was indicated that the detenu’s subsisting detention did not by itself invalidate the detention order but facts and circumstances justifying the order of preventive deten tion notwithstanding his custody were necessary to sustain such an order. It is observed in the said case that: ""Whether the detention of the said person would be necessary after he is released from jail, and if the authority is bona fide satisfied that such detention is necessary, he can make a valid order of detention a few days before the person is likely to be released. The antecedent history and the past conduct on which the order of detention would be based would, in such a case, be proximate in point of time and would have a rational connection with the conclusion drawn by the authority that the detention of the person atter his release is necessary .... "" It was further observed that: ""Therefore. we are satisfied that the question as to whether an order of detention can be passed against a person who is  Page 6 of 8 in detention or m jail, will always have to be determined in the circumstances of each case."" The principles laid down by the Constitution Bench are followed in a number of subsequent decisions. In Alijan Mian v. District Magistrate, Dhanbad, [1983] 4 SCC 301 the detention order was upheld even though the detenu was in jail custody on the date of passing of the detention order because the 324 detention order showed that the detaining authority was alive to the fact yet it was satisfied that if the detenu was enlarged on bail, which was quite likely, he could create problems of public order. In N. Meera Rani v. Government of Tamil Nadu & Anr., [ 1989] 4 SCC 4 18 all these earlier cases have been referred to extensively and the conclusions are deduced as follows: ""Subsisting custody of the detenu by itself does not invali date an order of his preventive detention and the decision must depend on the facts of the particular case, preventive detention being necessary to prevent the detenu from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State or to the maintenance of the public order etc. ordinarily it is not needed when the detenu is already in custody; the de taining authority must show its awareness to the fact of subsisting custody of the detenu and take that factor into account while making the order; but, even so, if the detain ing authority is reasonably satisfied on cogent material that there is likelihood of his release and in view of his antecedent activities which are proximate in pint of time he must be detained in order to prevent him from indulging in such prejudicial activities, the detention order can be validly made even in anticipation to operate on his release. This appears to us, to be the correct legal position."" In one of the latest judgments of this Court in Shri Dhar mendra Suganchand Chelawat etc. v. Union of India and Ors.. JT 1990 1 SC 184, once again all the authoritative pro nouncements including that of the Constitution Bench in Rameshwar Shaw’s case are referred to and the Bench which consisted of three Judges observed thus: ""The decisions referred to above led to the conclusion that an order for detention can be validly passed against a person in custody and for that purpose it is necessary that the grounds of detention must show that (i) the detaining authority was aware of the fact that the detenu is already in detention; and (ii) there were compelling reasons justi fying such detention despite the fact that the detenu is already in detention. The expression ""compelling reasons"" in the context of making an order for detention of a person already in custody implies that there must be cogent materi al before the detaining authority on the basis of which it may be 325 satisfied that (a) the detenu is likely to be released from custody in the near future and (b) taking into account the nature of the antecedent activities of the detenu, it is likely that after his release from custody he would indulge in prejudicial activities and it is necessary to detain him in order to prevent him from engaging in such activities."" It could thus be seen that no decision of this Court has gone to the extent of holding that no order of detention can validly be passed against a person in custody under any circumstances. Therefore the facts and circumstances of each case have to be taken into consideration in the context of considering the order of detention passed in the case of a detenu who is already in jail. We have already, in the  Page 7 of 8 instant case, referred to the grounds and the various cir cumstances noted by the detaining authority and we are satisfied that the detention order cannot be quashed on this ground. Learned counsel, however, strongly relied on Smt. Shashi Aggarwal’s case and Ramesh Yadav’s case and contended that in the instant case also the bail application could be opposed if moved or if enlarged the same can be questioned in a higher court and on that ground the detention order should be held to be invalid. In N. Meera Rani’s case a Bench of three Judges noted the above observations in Smt. Shashi Aggarwal’s case and Ramesh Yadav’s case and it is said that they were made on the facts of those particular cases and the Bench also observed thus:. ""A review of the above decisions reaffirms the position which was settled by the decision of a Constitution Bench in Rameshwar Shaw case. The conclusion about validity of the detention order in each case was reached on the facts of the particular case and the observations made in each of them have to be read in the context in which they are made. None of the observations made in any subsequent case can be construed at variance with the principle indicated in Ra meshwar Shaw case for the obvious reason that all subsequent decisions were by benches comprised of lesser number of judges. We have dealt with this matter at some length be cause an attempt has been made for some time to construe some of the recent decisions as modifying the principle enunciated by the Constitution Bench in Rameshwar Shaw’s case."" 326 AS a matter of fact, in Shri Dharmendra Suganchand Chela wat’s, case there is a reference to Smt. Shashi Aggarwal’s, case and Ramesh Yadav’s, case and a Bench of three Judges following the decision of the Constitution Bench in Ramesh war Shaw’s Case, laid down the above principles which we have already referred to. Therefore we see no force in the submission. The next submission of the learned counsel is that the detaining authority has not applied his mind properly in rejecting the representation made by the detenu. It is submitted that in Annexure X-3, an application sent by Vijay Kumar, the co-detenu, it is clearly mentioned that his statement was recorded under torture and duress. Likewise in Annexure X-4, a petition filed in the Court of A.C.M.M. New Delhi, it is complained that the statement was recorded under torture and duress. According to the learned counsel, this petition as well as the medical reports of the Doctors who examined Vijay Kumar have not been referred to and considered by the authority while rejecting the representa tion. Reliance is also placed on a judgment of the Delhi High Court in Sat Pal Manchanda v.M.L. Wadhawan and Ors., (Criminal Writ No. 333 of 1986) decided on 30.10.86. In that case it is held that all the relevant material should be taken into consideration by the detaining authority while disposing of the representation. But in the instant case the circumstances are different. As a matter of fact, it is referred in paragraph 15 of the grounds that a telegram dated 8.6.89 was received in the Ministry of Finance alleg ing that the detenu was picked up by the DRI officers and that the allegations made therein were found false and baseless. In paragraph 17, it is also mentioned that the detenu alongwith his accomplices retracted from their state ment dated 8.6.89. It can therefore be seen that the detain ing authority has considered the allegations that the detenu was manhandled etc. At any rate, the detaining authority has  Page 8 of 8 clearly noted that the detenu has retracted from the alleged statement, therefore it can not be said that there is non application of mind in this regard, namely, in considering the representation. The same principle applies to the Advi sory Board also. According to the submissions of the learned counsel, these documents were not placed before the Advisory Board in its meeting on 18.9.89. Whatever statement was made by the petitioners on 22.6.89 prior to the detention and the grounds clearly disclose that there was retraction. It must also be noted in this context that in the grounds in para graph 10 also it is mentioned that a telegram was received on 9.6.89) alleging about the wrongful arrest and extraction of the statements and the detaining authority has also taken note of the allegations made against the DRI officers which were round to 327 be false and baseless. The same material was there before the Advisory Board. Therefore there is no force in this submission. It is lastly submitted that there was 11 days delay in serving the detention order. It is true that the order of detention was passed on 13.7.89, but the same was served on 24.7.89. According to the learned counsel, there is a viola tion of Section 3(3) of the Act. The said provision lays down that for the purpose of Article 22(5) of the Constitu tion, the order should be served as soon as possible but ordinarily not later than five days and in exceptional circumstances and for reasons to be recorded in writing, not later than fifteen days from the date of detention. Learned counsel for the State submitted that firstly the point of delay was not taken up in the special leave petition, there fore he had no opportunity to counter the same. However, from the record he submitted that it took quite sometime for translating the documents to Hindi and Gurumukhi. We have seen the documents filed before us and we are satisfied that there are valid and sufficient reasons for delay in serving the detention order. Thus, we find no merit in anyone of the submissions. The petition is, therefore, dismissed. N.V.K. Petition dismissed","JUDGMENT: CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 2485 of 1989. From the Judgment and Order dated 12.12.1989 of the Delhi High Court in C.W.P. 589 of 1989. Harjinder Singh and R.N. Joshi for the Petitioner. Soli J. Sorabjee, P.K. Goswamy, Udai Lalit, C.V.S. Rao, P. Parmeshwaran and Sushma Suri for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by  Page 3 of 8 REDDY, J. This is a petition under Article 136 of the Constitution of India against the judgment and order of the High Court of Delhi dismissing the writ petition filed on behalf of the detenu challenging the detention. Notice was given and after hearing counsel for both the parties at length the matter is being disposed of at the admission stage. The detenu was detained under Section 3(1) of the Con servation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (hereinafter referred to as ’the Act’) by an order dated 13.7.89. On 7.6.89 Officers of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, New Delhi intercepted a Maruti Car in which one Mahesh Kumar Chauhan and three others were present but no recovery was effected on the spot. But later on the Car was thoroughly rummaged in presence of two independent witnesses and the occupants of the car and 206 foreign marked gold biscuits of ten tolas each were recovered from the cavities of the car meant for fitting speakers in the rear portion of the car. The occupants did not give any explanation for the possession of gold biscuits. On personal search of Mahesh, a slip was recovered which contained a telephone number and Mahesh Kumar in his statement admitted that he was to hand over the smuggled goods to one Vijay Kumar. The premises of these two peoples were searched and a receipt of token tax in respect of the car was recovered. Mahesh Kumar admitted that he was visiting Dubai frequently to bring con 320 sumer goods and gold ornaments for being sold in the local market. One Avtar Singh who was engaged in smuggling of foreign gold biscuits, agreed to sell the gold biscuits to Mahesh Kumar on commission. He also gave some more details about Avtar Singh. Similarly Vijay Kumar also made a state ment. From these statements it is also revealed that peti tioner herein Sanjeev Kumar Aggarwal had made arrangements for selling the gold biscuits. The residential premises of the petitioner was searched and he was taken into custody. The officers of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence questioned the petitioner and he gave a statement. On the basis of this material the detaining authority passed an order of detention on 13.7.89 and the same was served on 24.7.89. The grounds were also served in time. The learned counsel submitted that there is a total non-application of mind by the detaining authority inasmuch as he was failed to note that the detenu was in jail and that there is no possibility of his being released and the failure on the part of the detaining authority to consider the same renders the detention invalid. It is true that the petitioner was in judicial custody in connection with crimi nal proceedings. An application was filed in the court of A.C.M.M. Delhi for extending the remand and the remand was granted upto 6.7.89. However, two detenus who figured as co-accused in that criminal proceedings were also in the judicial custody and on their behalf an application for bail was filed. As mentioned in the grounds of detention the detaining authority has noted these circumstances. In para graph No. 16 it is mentioned that: ’I am aware that all of you are under judicial custody and possibility of your release on bail in near future cannot be ruled out. Also nothing prevents Mahesh Kumar Chauhan, Vijay Kumar Dharne and you from moving bail application and get ting release on bail."" Then in paragraph No. 24 it is mentioned thus: ""From the foregoing facts and circumstances and statements recorded in this connection as disclosed herein above, it is  Page 4 of 8 evident that you have engaged yourself in abetting the smuggling of goods unless prevented you will continue to do so in similar manner or otherwise in future when released on bail."" The further submission of the learned counsel is that the petitioner 321 alongwith two others were in judicial custody and they were further remanded upto 20.7.1989 and no bail application was filed or pending as on the date of passing orders of deten tion. Therefore it must necessarily be inferred that there is no awareness on the detaining authority of this aspect. Reliance is placed on some of the decisions of  in this context. In Abdul Razak Abdul Wahab Sheikh v.S.N. Sinha, Commis sioner of Police, Ahmadabad and Anr., [1989] 2 SCC 222 it is held that there must be awareness in the mind of the detain ing authority that the detenu is in custody at the time of service of order of detention and that cogent and relevant material and fresh facts have been disclosed necessitating making of an order of detention. In the course of the judg ment it is noted that the detaining authority also was not aware that application for bail filed on behalf of the detenu was rejected by the designated court and therefore, there was no application of mind. In Binod Singh v. District Magistrate, Dhanbad, [1986] 4 SCC 4 16 it is laid down ""If a man is in custody and there is no imminent possibility of his being released, the power of preventive detention should not be exercised. In the instant case when the actual order of detention was served upon the detenu, the detenu was in jail. There is no indica tion that this factor or the question that the said detenu might be released or that there was such a possibility of his release, was taken into consideration by the detaining authority properly and seriously before the service of the order."" In Vijay Kumar v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, [1982] 2 SCC 43 the detention order was quashed because it did not give the slightest indication that the detaining authority was aware that the detenu was already in jail. But in the case before us the detaining authority has noted in the grounds that the petitioner alongwith other two coaccused have been remanded to judicial custody and the bail applica tion was filed on behalf of the other two detenues and there is every likelihood of the petitioner also being released on bail and as such the possibility cannot be ruled out. The other material relied upon by the detaining authority in apprehending that the detenus are likely to be released on bail is that their remand to the judicial custody was upto 20.7.89 and that the other two co-accused have also filed bail applications and they were pending and that this mate rial is sufficient to indicate that petitioner also may file bail application and is likely to be released on bail. 322 We have carefully examined the material relied upon by the detaining authority in this regard and we are of the opinion that it cannot be said that there was no awareness in the mind of the detaining authority about the detenu being in custody and that if he is released on bail he is likely to indulge in the prejudicial activities. At this juncture we may also notice another decision of the Supreme Court. In Ramakrishna Rawat v. District Magistrate, Jabal pur, [1975] 4 SCC 164, the detention order was upheld since the custody was obviously of a short duration and on the basis of the antecedent activities of the detenu in the  Page 5 of 8 proximate past, the detaining authority could reasonably reach its subjective satisfaction in respect of the detenu that he was in custody. The learned counsel, however, submitted that in case the bail application is filed, the same can be opposed or even if enlarged the same can be questioned in a higher court and that a mere bald statement that the person would repeat his criminal activities after release would not be enough. In Smt. Shashi Aggarwal v. State of U.P. and Ors., [1988] 1 SCC 436 it is observed: ""The possibility of the court granting bail may not be sufficient. Nor a bald statement that the person would repeat his criminal activities would be enough. There must also be credible information or cogent reasons apparent on the record that the detenu, if enlarged on bail, would act prejudicially to the interest of public order."" This is a case of detention on the ground of likelihood of disruption of public order by the detenu. The detention order shows that the order had been made only on the sole ground that the detenu was trying to come out on bail. Learned counsel also relied upon the decision in Ramesh Yadav v. District Magistrate, Etah & Ors., [1985] 4 SCC 232 wherein it is observed: ""Merely on the ground that an accused in detention as an under trial prisoner was likely to get bail, an order of detention under the National Security Act should not ordi narily be passed.

The Court delivered the following order: ORDER Two contentions were raised by the petitioner in this writ petition challenging the appointment of Respondent No. 1, Shri Devi Lal as Deputy Prime Minister of India: (i) that the oath administered to him as Deputy Prime Minister was not the oath in accordance with the prescrip tion of the Constitution; and (ii) he was still functioning as the Chief Minister of Haryana when the oath of office of his new assignment was administered to him. Pursuant to notice, two affidavits have been filed--one by the Respondent No. 1 and the other on behalf of the Union of India. In the affidavit of Respondent No. 1 certain precedents have been relied upon and the practice which has been followed eversince the Constitution came into force has been referred to. Learned Attorney General appearing on behalf of the Union of India has stated that the form prescribed in the Third Schedule pursuant to the requirement of Article 75(4) of the Constitution is only for a Minister of the Union and there is no separate form even for the Prime Minister. Since the Prime Minister is also a member of the Council of Minis ters, he takes the same oath as the other ministers are required to take. He maintains that yet in view of the fact that the Constitution describes him as the Prime Minister, while being sworn into office, he describes himself as Prime Minister and this practice is in vogue eversince 1950. The oath register is by the incumbent signed as Prime Minister and all other ministers sign as Ministers. He further indi cates that describing Shri Devi Lal as Deputy Prime Minister is descriptive only and for all purposes he is a Minister and there is no 3 constitutional sanction for the post of Deputy Prime Minis ter as such. Relying on a bench decision of this Court in the case of Virji Ram Sutaria v. Nathalal Premji Bhavadia & Ors., [1969] 2 SCR 627, learned Attorney General further contends that the prescribed oath should be divided into two parts, one which is descriptive and the other which contains the sub stantial part. And according to him, as long as the substantial part is properly followed, a mere mistake or error in the --descriptive part would not vitiate the oath. This Court in the reported decision said: ""In this case, as we have already noted, the essential requirement of Article 173 read with Form VII-A was that the person taking the oath or making the affirmation would bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution and uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India. The words which precede this portion are merely descriptive of the person and of his nomination as a candidate."" In view of the clear statement. made by the learned Attorney General that Respondent No. 1 is just a Minister like other members of the Council of Ministers though he has been described as Deputy Prime Minister but the description of him as Deputy Prime Minister does not confer on him any powers of the Prime Minister, along with his other submis sions, we think the first contention raised by the petition er has no force.

The Court delivered the following order: ORDER Two contentions were raised by the petitioner in this writ petition challenging the appointment of Respondent No. 1, Shri Devi Lal as Deputy Prime Minister of India: (i) that the oath administered to him as Deputy Prime Minister was not the oath in accordance with the prescrip tion of the Constitution; and (ii) he was still functioning as the Chief Minister of Haryana when the oath of office of his new assignment was administered to him.

Manohar Hon’ble Mr. Justice G.B. Pattanaik B.S. Malik, Sr. Adv., K.S. Chauhan, Adv. with him for the appellant Ms. Nandini Gore, Prem Malhotra, Advs., for the Respondents O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: Special leave granted. Heard both sides. The appellant was appointed as member of the Haryana Public Service Commission with effect from 4.3.80. He continued as a member of the Haryana Public Service Commission till 28.8.84 when he was appointed as Chairman of the Haryana Public Service Commission. He continued as Chairman of the Haryana Public Service Commission for a period of six years up to 27.8.90. The appellant was granted pension at the rate of Rs. 1,800/- per month for his services as Chairman of the Haryana Public Service Commission. The appellant contends that in addition, he is also entitled to pension for his services as a member of the Haryana Public Service Commission for a period of 4 years, 5 months and 24 days. The relevant Regulation of the haryana Government known as the Haryana Public Service Commission (Conditions of Service) Regulations, 1972 is Regulation 9A(1). The relevant portion of Regulation 9A is as follows: 9A(1): ""Subject to the provisions of these regulations, every person, who, on or after the Ist day of November, 1966, ceases to hold the office of the Chairman or the Member, shall, with effect from the Ist December, 1973 or the date of his ceasing to hold the office, whichever is later, be entitled to pension for his life at the rate of two hundred rupees per month for each completed year of service as   of 3 the Chairman or the Member, as the case may be, rendered after the 31st day of October, 1966, subject to a maximum of eight hundred and fifty rupees and seven hundred and fifty rupees per month respectively: ................................... ................................... ................................... Provided further that no pension shall be payable during the period for which................the Member may, after his retirement as such, hold office as .............the Chairman of H.P.S.C. or of any other State Public Service Commission."" The quantum of pension has since been revised to Rs.250/- per month for a member and Rs.300/- per month for the Chairman. The maximum quantum of pension has also been revised to Rs. 1,800/- per month in the case of the Chairman and Rs. 1,500/- per month in the case of a member. The appellant is entitled to the benefit of the revised amount. Under Rule 9A(1) two separate ceilings are provided; one for the pension of a Chairman and the other for the pension of a member. The question is whether a person who has acted both as a member and subsequently as a Chairman, will be entitled to a pension only on the basis of his services as a Chairman or whether he will also be entitled to a separate pension on the basis of his services as a member of the Haryana Public Service Commission. Under the Union Public Service Commission (Members) Regulations 1969, there is an express provision contained in Explanation (II) to Regulation 9 which provides that when the total service for pension is rendered by a person, partly as a member and, partly as a Chairman, the pension Admissible to such person shall be the aggregate of the pension calculated separately for each such term as a member and as a Chairman. In the Haryana Public Service Commission (Regulations) 1972 there is no such express provision. However, the proviso to Rule 9A throws some light on the manner in which the pension is to be calculated. Under the proviso, when a member of the Haryana Public Service Commission retires as a member, he would be entitled to pension as a member. However, if he thereafter holds office (inter alia) as the Chairman of the Haryana Public Service Commission, he will not get any pension during the period for which he holds office as Chairman. There is an embargo on his receiving pension as a member during the period he functions as a Chairman. Once he ceased to function as a Chairman the embargo is lifted and he would be entitled to get pension as a member for the period during which he served as a member of the Haryana Public Service Commission. This, of course, will be subject to the ceiling prescribed under Regulation 9A. At the same time as the Chairman of the Haryana Public Service Commission, for the period of service rendered by him as Chairman, he would also get pension at the rate prescribed under Regulation 9A subject to the maximum. The appellant is, therefore, entitled to pension as a member for the service he rendered as a member prior to his appointment as Chairman subject to the maximum, as also pension as Chairman of the Haryana Public Service Commission calculated on the basis of the period during which he held office of the Chairman, subject to a maximum as laid down in Regulation  Page 3 of 3 9A.

62,,EX. CAPT. R.S. DHULL,STATE OF HARYANA AND ORS.,21/04/1988,"A.S. ANAND, S. RAJENDRA BABU","O R D E R Leave granted. The appellant is an Ex-Serviceman. He was accepted as a Tehsildar candidate w.e.f. September 13, 1974 and allowed the benefit of military service for the purposes of seniority and was assigned the deemed date of May 27, 1973. It appears that certain adverse remarks came to be recorded in his Annual Confidential Reports for the years 1978-79, 1981-82, 1982-83 and 1984-85. The appellant questioned the adverse remarks and sought their expunction by filing a writ petition in the High Court in 1987. The High Court on 2nd May, 1990 directed the expunction of the adverse entries in the Annual Confidential Report of the appellant. The High Court also set aside the orders passed by the competent authorities against refusal to expunge the adverse entries. The respondents were directed to grant consequential relief to the appellant. As a consequence of the judgment of the High Court dated 2nd May, 1990, the appellant was promoted as a District Revenue Officer on September 29, 1991 w.e.f. March 15, 1982. The appellant, however, was not satisfied with the orders made pursuant to the judgment of the High Court and he, therefore, filed a special leave petition in this Court being S.L.P.(C) No. 104/92 (C.A. No. 4249/92). A Bench of this Court granted leave and by an order dated 12.10.92 directed consideration of the appellant’s name for promotion to H.C.S. (Executive Branch) without taking into account the expunged adverse remarks. After the judgment by this Court rendered in Civil Appeal No.4249/92 on 12th october, 1992 the case of the appellant was taken up for consideration by the State Government and vide communication dated 28th December, 1992 from the Chief Secretary, Government of Haryana, Chandigarh to the appellant, he was informed that the matter had been placed before the selection committee constituted under Rule 7(1) of the Punjab Civil Service (Executive Branch) Rules, 1930 for considering his name for recruitment to the H.C.S. (Executive Branch) from Register A-1 for the vacancies which occurred in the year 1980 and 1982 as also for the special recruitment to the H.C.S. (Executive Branch) held in 1983, without taking into account the adverse expunged remarks.   of 5 The appellant was informed that the Selection Committee had considered his name for inclusion in the list of persons considered suitable for appointment to the H.C.s. (Executive Branch) against the vacancies for the said years but that ""The Selection Committee in its meeting held on 16-12-1992 has found the record of other persons whose names had been included in the lists, already prepared on 13 12-1982, 17-3-1987 and 24-2-1988, better than yours and has decided not to include your name in the said lists. Since your name has not been included in the list of persons considered suitable for appointment to the HCS(Executive Branch), you can not be considered for appointment to the HCS (Executive Branch) against the vacancies of Registrar A-1 for the years 1980, 1982 and special recruitment for the year 1983."" The appellant thereafter filed Civil Writ Petition No. 6977/93 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana alleging that his name had been wrongly ""excluded from consideration for appointment to the Haryana Civil Service for the years 1980, 1982 and 1983."" Various grounds were taken in support of the writ petition. The learned Single Judge of the High Court vide judgment dated 25th July, 1984 dismissed the writ petition. In the course of the judgment the learned Single Judge referred to Rule 7 of the Punjab Civil Service (Executive Branch) Rules, 1930 as amended and applied to the State of Haryana as well as to a comparative chart of the service record of the appellant and those who were selected to the Haryana Civil Service (Executive Branch) in the years 1980, 1982 and 1983. The learned Single Judge observed: ""Learned counsel for the petitioner could not refer to any material on the record to show that the service record of the petitioner was better than that of the persons who hadbeen included in the list prepared by the committee and sent to the commission for Recommending in order of merit, Case of the petitioner was considered in terms of the Rules ibid but his service record was not found better than that of the candidates recommended to the Commission for selection. It is not the case of the petitioner that names of all the eligible candidates were to be sent to the commission for selection. Rule 7 of the Rules specifically provides that the Committee shall prepare a list of eligible candidates equal to twice the number of vacancies available and this is precisely that was done by the Committee. The lists prepared by the Committee were sent to be Commission for recommending in order of merit and  Page 3 of 5 equal to the number of vacancies the most suitable candidates entered in the list of being selected as candidates for entry into Register A-1. Petitioner had only a right of Consideration and his name was duly considered by the Committee. He was not considered suitable by the Committee and thus his name could not be (sent to the Commission. The Government placed the record before this Court to know that the case of the petitioner was duly considered against the vacancies that occurred during the years 1980, 1982 and 1983 and that his name could not be included in the list prepared by the Committee."" (Emphasis ours) A Letters Patent Appeal filed against the judgment of the learned single Judge was dismissed on 7th September, 1984. The Division Bench agreed with the learned Single judge and recorded a finding that consequent upon the expunction of the adverse remarks, the Selection Committee had considered the case of the appellant for inclusion of his name in the list prepared for the vacancies relating to the relevant years 1980, 1982 and 1983 and after due consideration he was not found suitable. The Bench rightly held that the appellant had only a right of consideration and since his name was duly considered by the High Powered Committee and he was not found suitable, he could not make any grievance against his non-selection. Aggrieved by the judgment of the Division Bench, the present special leave petition has been filed. The appellant had filed the special leave petition in person. We, however, found that the questions requiring consideration in the special leave petition were such which required assistance from a lawyer and, accordingly, we directed the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee to provide assistance to the appellant. Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior advocate agreed to assist the Court and has appeared during the proceedings in this case. While this appeal was pending in this Court learned counsel for the State informed the Court that the petitioner had been retired compulsorily in 1993 vide order dated 29th September, 1993 and, therefore, his appeal had been rendered infructuous. The appellant, however, submitted that he had filed a writ petition in the high Court challenging the order of compulsory retirement (C.W.P. No. 7214/93) and vide judgment dated 17-10-95 a learned Single judge of the High Court had allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of compulsory retirement. It transpires that a Letters Patent Appeal filed against that judgment of the learned Single Judge by the State was dismissed on 23rd of July, 1997. The State, thereafter, decided not to file any special leave petition against the order of the Division Bench dismissing Letters Patent Appeal on 23rd of July, 1997. As a consequence, the order of compulsory retirement made on 29.9.93 did not survive. Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior advocate, submitted that not only was the appellant entitled to be treated in service from the date when the order of his compulsory retirement was made i.e. on 29th September, 1993 till the date he attained the age of superannuation on 29th  Page 4 of 5 February, 1996, but he was also entitled to receive G.P. Fund and the other retiral benefits. It was submitted that even pension of the appellant had not been fixed and he had not been paid any pension and the State had no justification to withhold the retiral benefits. On 15-10-97 we made the following order: ""During the course of hearing of this special leave petition, it has been submitted by learned counsel for the State that the State Government has decided not to file any special leave petition against the order of the Division Bench dismissing Letters Patent Appeal on 23.7.1997. It, therefore, shows that the order of compulsory retirement made on 29.9.1993 does not survive, as the writ petition against that order was allowed and the Letters Patent Appeal has been dismissed. Mr. Raju Ramcachandran, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that though the petitioner has superannuated on 29.2.1996, the G.P. Fund was not released to him till the High Court had to intervene in the LPA filed by the State. It is stated that on 22.5.1997, during the pendency of the LPA, the High Court directed the State to release the G.P. Fund of the petitioner and consequent thereupon, it has been released. It is, however, submitted that the pension of the petitioner has not been fixed and he has not been parts any pension at all from the date he superannuated. Withholding of pension is a serious matter. We view it with concern. Learned counsel for the State assures us that he will have the matter examined at priority basis. We, therefore, direct: 1) The State shall, on the basis of the service record available with them, fix the provisional pension of the petitioner and intimate the same to him within ten days by registered post. In case any formality is required to be completed by the petitioner for receiving pension, intimation shall be given to him in the same communication within ten days. Within fifteen days from the date of receipt of the communication from the State, the petitioner shall furnish the required information, if any, as also his response insofar as the fixation of the provisional pension is concerned.  Page 5 of 5 2) The State shall also, on the basis of the provisional pension, work out the arrears of the pension and communicate the same to the petitioner. The amount of arrears so calculated shall be paid to the petitioner on the basis of the provisional pension within six weeks from today. This shall, however, be without prejudice to the rights of the parties."" The provisional pension, we are informed has since been fixed and is being paid to the appellant. We have heard learned counsel for the parties on the main grievance of the appellant i.e. that his name was wrongly excluded from consideration for appointment to the Haryana Civil Service for the years 1980, 1982 and 1983. We have examined the record also. The appellant had only a right to be considered and we agree both with the learned Single Judge and the Division bench of the High Court that his case was properly considered ignoring the expunged adverse entries made in his Annual Confidential Reports by a High Powered Committees but the appellant was not found suitable by that Committee to be recommenced to the Commission. It is, therefore, futile to contend that there was any lack of consideration of his case or that the consideration of his case was based on any irrelevant or inadmissible grounds. The record reveals that his case was considered alongwith the service record of the other eligible candidates who had been brought on the select list and we are not pursuaded to hold that the consideration of his case suffered from any infirmity. The plea that the High Powered Committee was influenced by the adverse entries is not correct and deserves a notice only to be rejected. We, therefore, do not find any reason to interfere with the orders of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench in that regard. However, there is one other aspect of the matter which requires our consideration. Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior advocate submitted that in spite of the orders of this Court dated 15-10-97 (supra) all the retiral benefits have not so far been paid to the appellant. He submitted that while provisional pension has been fixed, but other benefits like G.P. Fund dues, Gratuity etc. have not so far been paid to him. He rightly argued that the respondents were not justified to withhold the G.P. Fund and the Gratuity more particularly in view of the directions given by us on 15-10 97. We, therefore, direct that while the case of fixation of proper pension of the appellant shall be decided by the respondents within three months from the date of this order, the G.P. Fund, Gratuity and other retiral benefits (which remain unpaid) shall also be paid to the appellant within the aforesaid period of three months. The appellant shall also be entitled to interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the withheld G.P. Fund and Gratuity etc. from the date the same became payable to him on his attaining the age of superannuation till the date the payment is made to him. The appeal is thus disposed of in above terms. No costs. We wish to place on record our deep appreciation for the valuable assistance rendered by Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior advocate to the Court.","O R D E R Leave granted. The appellant is an Ex-Serviceman. He was accepted as a Tehsildar candidate w.e.f. September 13, 1974 and allowed the benefit of military service for the purposes of seniority and was assigned the deemed date of May 27, 1973. It appears that certain adverse remarks came to be recorded in his Annual Confidential Reports for the years 1978-79, 1981-82, 1982-83 and 1984-85. The appellant questioned the adverse remarks and sought their expunction by filing a writ petition in the High Court in 1987. The High Court on 2nd May, 1990 directed the expunction of the adverse entries in the Annual Confidential Report of the appellant. The High Court also set aside the orders passed by the competent authorities against refusal to expunge the adverse entries. The respondents were directed to grant consequential relief to the appellant. As a consequence of the judgment of the High Court dated 2nd May, 1990, the appellant was promoted as a District Revenue Officer on September 29, 1991 w.e.f. March 15, 1982. The appellant, however, was not satisfied with the orders made pursuant to the judgment of the High Court and he, therefore, filed a special leave petition in this Court being S.L.P.(C) No. 104/92 (C.A. No. 4249/92). A Bench of this Court granted leave and by an order dated 12.10.92 directed consideration of the appellant’s name for promotion to H.C.S. (Executive Branch) without taking into account the expunged adverse remarks. After the judgment by this Court rendered in Civil Appeal No.4249/92 on 12th october, 1992 the case of the appellant was taken up for consideration by the State Government and vide communication dated 28th December, 1992 from the Chief Secretary, Government of Haryana, Chandigarh to the appellant, he was informed that the matter had been placed before the selection committee constituted under Rule 7(1) of the Punjab Civil Service (Executive Branch) Rules, 1930 for considering his name for recruitment to the H.C.S. (Executive Branch) from Register A-1 for the vacancies which occurred in the year 1980 and 1982 as also for the special recruitment to the H.C.S. (Executive Branch) held in 1983, without taking into account the adverse expunged remarks.   of 5 The appellant was informed that the Selection Committee had considered his name for inclusion in the list of persons considered suitable for appointment to the H.C.s. (Executive Branch) against the vacancies for the said years but that ""The Selection Committee in its meeting held on 16-12-1992 has found the record of other persons whose names had been included in the lists, already prepared on 13 12-1982, 17-3-1987 and 24-2-1988, better than yours and has decided not to include your name in the said lists. Since your name has not been included in the list of persons considered suitable for appointment to the HCS(Executive Branch), you can not be considered for appointment to the HCS (Executive Branch) against the vacancies of Registrar A-1 for the years 1980, 1982 and special recruitment for the year 1983."" The appellant thereafter filed Civil Writ Petition No. 6977/93 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana alleging that his name had been wrongly ""excluded from consideration for appointment to the Haryana Civil Service for the years 1980, 1982 and 1983."" Various grounds were taken in support of the writ petition. The learned Single Judge of the High Court vide judgment dated 25th July, 1984 dismissed the writ petition. In the course of the judgment the learned Single Judge referred to Rule 7 of the Punjab Civil Service (Executive Branch) Rules, 1930 as amended and applied to the State of Haryana as well as to a comparative chart of the service record of the appellant and those who were selected to the Haryana Civil Service (Executive Branch) in the years 1980, 1982 and 1983. The learned Single Judge observed: ""Learned counsel for the petitioner could not refer to any material on the record to show that the service record of the petitioner was better than that of the persons who hadbeen included in the list prepared by the committee and sent to the commission for Recommending in order of merit, Case of the petitioner was considered in terms of the Rules ibid but his service record was not found better than that of the candidates recommended to the Commission for selection. It is not the case of the petitioner that names of all the eligible candidates were to be sent to the commission for selection. Rule 7 of the Rules specifically provides that the Committee shall prepare a list of eligible candidates equal to twice the number of vacancies available and this is precisely that was done by the Committee. The lists prepared by the Committee were sent to be Commission for recommending in order of merit and  Page 3 of 5 equal to the number of vacancies the most suitable candidates entered in the list of being selected as candidates for entry into Register A-1. Petitioner had only a right of Consideration and his name was duly considered by the Committee. He was not considered suitable by the Committee and thus his name could not be (sent to the Commission. The Government placed the record before this Court to know that the case of the petitioner was duly considered against the vacancies that occurred during the years 1980, 1982 and 1983 and that his name could not be included in the list prepared by the Committee."" (Emphasis ours) A Letters Patent Appeal filed against the judgment of the learned single Judge was dismissed on 7th September, 1984. The Division Bench agreed with the learned Single judge and recorded a finding that consequent upon the expunction of the adverse remarks, the Selection Committee had considered the case of the appellant for inclusion of his name in the list prepared for the vacancies relating to the relevant years 1980, 1982 and 1983 and after due consideration he was not found suitable. The Bench rightly held that the appellant had only a right of consideration and since his name was duly considered by the High Powered Committee and he was not found suitable, he could not make any grievance against his non-selection. Aggrieved by the judgment of the Division Bench, the present special leave petition has been filed. The appellant had filed the special leave petition in person. We, however, found that the questions requiring consideration in the special leave petition were such which required assistance from a lawyer and, accordingly, we directed the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee to provide assistance to the appellant. Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior advocate agreed to assist the Court and has appeared during the proceedings in this case. While this appeal was pending in this Court learned counsel for the State informed the Court that the petitioner had been retired compulsorily in 1993 vide order dated 29th September, 1993 and, therefore, his appeal had been rendered infructuous. The appellant, however, submitted that he had filed a writ petition in the high Court challenging the order of compulsory retirement (C.W.P. No. 7214/93) and vide judgment dated 17-10-95 a learned Single judge of the High Court had allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of compulsory retirement. It transpires that a Letters Patent Appeal filed against that judgment of the learned Single Judge by the State was dismissed on 23rd of July, 1997. The State, thereafter, decided not to file any special leave petition against the order of the Division Bench dismissing Letters Patent Appeal on 23rd of July, 1997. As a consequence, the order of compulsory retirement made on 29.9.93 did not survive. Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior advocate, submitted that not only was the appellant entitled to be treated in service from the date when the order of his compulsory retirement was made i.e. on 29th September, 1993 till the date he attained the age of superannuation on 29th  Page 4 of 5 February, 1996, but he was also entitled to receive G.P. Fund and the other retiral benefits. It was submitted that even pension of the appellant had not been fixed and he had not been paid any pension and the State had no justification to withhold the retiral benefits. On 15-10-97 we made the following order: ""During the course of hearing of this special leave petition, it has been submitted by learned counsel for the State that the State Government has decided not to file any special leave petition against the order of the Division Bench dismissing Letters Patent Appeal on 23.7.1997.

These appeals by special leave are directed against the judgment of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana holding that the sale of insulated copper wires manufactured by the appellant 480 assessee does not entitle it to the benefits conferred by ss. 33(1)(iii) (c)(A) and 80E of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the assessment years 1966-67 and 1967-68 and the benefits conferred by ss. 33(1)(b)(B)(i) and 80I of the Income-tax Act, 1961 for the assessment years 1968-69 to 1971-72 Section 33 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provides for the grant of development rebate. Prior to April 1, 1968, s. 33(1)(iii)(c)(A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provided: ""(1) In respect of a new ship acquired or new machinery or plant (other than office appliances or road transport vehicles) installed after the 31st day of March, 1954, which is owned by the assessee and is wholly used for the purposes of the business carried on by him, a sum by way of development rebate, equivalent to (i) ..............................................

This provision was substituted, with effect from April 1, 1968, by the present provision which reads: ""33(1)(a) In respect of a new ship or new machinery or plant (other than office appliances or road transport vehicles) which is owned by the assessee and is wholly used for the purposes of the business carried on by him, there shall, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section and of section 34, be allowed a deduction in respect of a previous year in which the ship was acquired or the machinery or plant was installed or, if the ship, machinery or plant is first put to use in the immediately succeeding previous year, then, in respect of that previous year, a sum by way of development rebate as specified in clause (b).

A deduction was also available to an assessee in respect of profits and gains from specified industries in the case of certain companies prior to April 1, 1968. Section 80E provided: ""80E (1) In the case of a company to which this  Page 4 of 7 section applies, where the total income (as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act) includes any profits and gains attributable to the business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power or of construction, manufacture or production of any one or (- more of the articles or things specified in the list in the Fifth Schedule, there shall be allowed a deduction from such pro fits and gains of an amount equal to eight per cent. thereof in computing the total income of the company."" Section 80E was deleted with effect from April 1, 1968 and was substituted by s. 80-I which provides: ""80-I(1) In the case of a company to which this section ap plies, where the gross total income includes any profits and gains attributable to any priority industry, there shall be allowed, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section, a deduction from such profits and gains of an amount equal to eight per cent, thereof, in computing the total income of the company."" It is not disputed between the parties that the assessee is a company to which the provisions of s. 80E and subsequently of s. 80I will apply. Section 80I, it may be noted, was deleted by the Finance Act, 1972 with effect from April 1, 1973. With effect from April 1, 1968 the expression ’priority industry’ was defined in s. 80B(7) as meaning: ""the business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power or of construction, manufacture or production of any one or more of the articles or things specified in the list in the Fifth Schedule or the business of any hotel where such business is carried on by an Indian company and the hotel is for the time being approved in this behalf by the Central Government."" 483 The word ’Sixth’ was substituted for ’Fifth’ by the Finance Act 1968 A with effect from April 1, 1969. With effect from April 1, 1964 the Fifth Schedule set forth a list of articles and things and items 7, 17 and 24 which possess some relevance to this case read as follows: ""(7) Equipment for the generation and transmission of electricity including transformers, cables and transmission towers, (17) Electronic equipment, namely, radar equipment, computers, electronic accounting and business machines, electronic communication equipment, electronic control instruments and basic components, such as valves, transistors, resisters, condensors, coils, magnetic materials and microwave components, (24) Component parts of the articles mentioned in items Nos. (4), (5), (7) and (9), that is to say, such parts as are essential for the working of the machinery referred to in the items aforesaid and have been given for that purpose some special shape or quality which would not be essential for their use for any other purpose and are in comp lete finished form and ready for fitment."" The Sixth Schedule which replaced the Fifth Schedule with effect from April 1, 1969 contained identical items 7,17 and 24.  Page 5 of 7 These appeals relate to the assessment years 1966-67 to 1971-72. The assessee carries on the business of manufacture and sale of insulated copper wires. Before the Income Tax officer, it claimed that it constituted a priority industry for the purposes of the provisions of ss. 33(1)(iii)(c)(A) and 80E read with items 7, 17 and 24 of the Fifth Schedule of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the first two years and sections 33(1)(b)(B)(i) and 80-1 read with items 7, 17 and 24 of the Fifth or the Sixth Schedule, as the case may be, of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the latter four years. The assessee claimed that it was entitled to the benefits conferred by those provisions for the aforesaid assessment years as a ’priority industry’. It asserted that the wires manufactured by it were covered by the word ’cables’ employed in the articles and things specified in items 7, 17 and 24 of the Fifth Schedule 484 for the assessment years 1966-67, 1967-68 and 1968-69 and items 7, 17 and 24 of the Sixth Schedule of the Income Tax Act for the assessment years 1969-70 to 1971-72. It produced expert evidence in support of its claim. The Income Tax officer rejected the claim made by the assessee. An appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was dismissed. The assessee then appealed to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The Appellate Tribunal allowed the six appeals and held that the assessee was entitled to the benefits claimed by it as a ’prority industry’. It noted that although the assessee had based its claim on items 7, 17 and 24 of the Schedules, the claim was emphatically pressed in the hearing before it under item 7 alone. The question before it then was limited to the point whether the wires manufactured by the asses see fell within item 7. In disposing of the appeals, the Appellate Tribunal adverted to its finding in the appeals for the two immediately preceding assessment years 1964-65 and 1965-66. In its appellate order for the assessment year 1964-65 it found that the assessee manufactured aluminium cables which were used in the transmission of electricity and held that, therefore, it was entitled to the benefit of the Fifth Schedule relevant for those two assessment years. In the appeal pertaining to the assessment year 1965-66 it considered the matter again and upheld the claim in view of its order for the preceding assessment year. It noted that the Revenue had accepted the orders and had not questioned them in reference. It found from a perusal of the Industrial Licences on the basis of which the assessee was operating that there was no change in the nature or type of the goods manufactured by it during the six assessment years before it in appeal. It observed that when it referred to aluminium cables in its earlier orders it should have described them as copper and aluminium cables. Having regard to the material before it, the Appellate Tribunal found no reason to change its opinion from the view taken in the preceding assessment years that the manufacture of the cables attracted the benefits claimed by the assessee. Thereafter, at the instance of the Revenue, the Appellate Tribunal made a reference for the six assessment years to the High Court of Punjab and Haryana for its opinion on the following two questions: ""Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the assessee-company was entitled to the benefits conferred by the provisions of sections 33(1)(iii)(c)(a) and 80E of the Income Tax Act, 1961? 485 2. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances  Page 6 of 7 of the case, the assessee-company was entitled to the benefits conferred by the provisions of sections 33(1)(b)(B)(i) and 80-I of the Income Tax Act, 1961?"" The High Court answered those questions in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee. The High Court differed from the Appellate Tribunal and took the view that in the cases for the assessment years under consideration the Income Tax officer had come into possession of fresh facts indicating that the assessee was manufacturing copper wires of a particular type known as winding wires which were exclusively used in the manufacture of different types of gadgets and not for the purpose of generation and transmission of electricity. It observed that the wires were not meant for the generation and transmission of electricity, and they would fall within item 7 only if they were meant solely for that purpose and not otherwise. In these appeals it is contended on behalf of the assessee that the High Court has misconstrued the facts found by the Appellate Tribunal and has, therefore, erroneously held that the cables manufactured by the assessee do not fall within the scope of item 7. It is urged also that the true test for determining whether the cables could be used in the generation and transmission of electricity was that laid down by the Madras High Court in Commissioner of Income-Tax, Tamil Nadu-V v. Dhandayuthapani Foundry (Private) Ltd., [1980] 123 l.T.R. 709 where in considering the question whether an implement could be described as an agricultural implement it was observed that the real test was not whether it was exclusively used for agricultural purposes but whether it was commonly so used and whether it was intimately and directly connected with agricultural operations. The point before us is whether the cables manufactured by the assessee qualify for inclusion in item 7 of the Fifth Schedule or the Sixth Schedule, as the case may be having regard to the relevant assessment year. Item 7 speaks of equipment for the generation and transmission of electricity, and such equipment includes transformers, cables and trans- mission towers. To appreciate what is comprehended in item 7, it is permissible to refer to a related entry, item 24, which refers to component parts of the articles mentioned, inter alia, in item 7. When item 24 is read in its entirety, it is apparent that the component parts mentioned therein are component parts of what can be described as machinery. Then reading item 7 in conjunction with item 24, the con 486 clusion is inescapable that when item 7 speaks of equipment, reference is intended to machinery needed for the generation and transmission of electricity. The item envisages complete self-contained units of equipment, units which on being put together or connected together constitute the apparatus for the generation and transmission of electricity. Viewed in that context, the reference in item 7 to cables must mean cables identifiable as a complete self-contained unit in themselves as a distinct unit of equipment when employed in the generation and transmission of electricity. A cable does not fall within item 7 if it is merely a component, or part of a component, of a unit of equipment or machinery. The High Court is right in our opinion, in holding that the Appellate Tribunal erred in ignoring the fresh evidence gathered by the Income Tax officer and considered by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner in the assessment proceedings under consideration. The sales accounts of the  Page 7 of 7 assessee showed that the assessee had sold winding wires used in the manufacture of different types of electrical gadgets and for the purpose of transmission of electricity. These are winding wires, employed in coils, winding of armatures, etc. and can not be identified at all as cables in the sense in which item 7 conceives of cables. That being so, the test propounded in Commissioner of Income-Tax, Tamil Nadu-V v. Dhandayuthapani Foundry (Private) Ltd. (supra) does not call for consideration. In the circumstances, the questions referred to the High Court for its opinion were rightly answered in the negative, in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.

Appeals dismissed","JUDGMENT: CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal Nos 597-599 (NT) of 1985 From the Judgment and order dated 3.5.1983 of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in Income Tax Reference Nos. 61, 63 and 64 of 1977 Dr. Devi Pal, V.S. Desai, O.C. Mathur, Ms A K. Verma, Ms. Meera Verma and S. Sukumaran for the Appellant. S.C. Manchanda and Ms. A Subhashini for the Respondent The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATHAK, J. These appeals by special leave are directed against the judgment of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana holding that the sale of insulated copper wires manufactured by the appellant 480 assessee does not entitle it to the benefits conferred by ss. 33(1)(iii) (c)(A) and 80E of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the assessment years 1966-67 and 1967-68 and the benefits conferred by ss. 33(1)(b)(B)(i) and 80I of the Income-tax Act, 1961 for the assessment years 1968-69 to 1971-72 Section 33 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provides for the grant of development rebate. Prior to April 1, 1968, s. 33(1)(iii)(c)(A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provided: ""(1) In respect of a new ship acquired or new machinery or plant (other than office appliances or road transport vehicles) installed after the 31st day of March, 1954, which is owned by the assessee and is wholly used for the purposes of the business carried on by him, a sum by way of development rebate, equivalent to (i) ..............................................

(B) ............................... shall, subject to the provisions of s. 34, be allowed as a deduction in respect of the previous year in which the ship was acquired or the machinery or plant was installed or, if the ship, machinery or plant is first put to use in the immediately succeeding previous year, then, in respect of that previous year."" This provision was substituted, with effect from April 1, 1968, by the present provision which reads: ""33(1)(a) In respect of a new ship or new machinery or plant (other than office appliances or road transport vehicles) which is owned by the assessee and is wholly used for the purposes of the business carried on by him, there shall, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section and of section 34, be allowed a deduction in respect of a previous year in which the ship was acquired or the machinery or plant was installed or, if the ship, machinery or plant is first put to use in the immediately succeeding previous year, then, in respect of that previous year, a sum by way of development rebate as specified in clause (b). (A) .............................................. (B) in the case of machinery or plant, (i) where the machinery or plant is installed for the purposes of business of construction, manufacture or production of any one or more of the articles or things specified in the list in the Fifth Schedule, (a) thirty-five per cent of the actual cost of the machinery or plant to the assessee, where it is in stalled before the 1st day of April, 1970, and (b) twenty-five per cent of such cost, where it is installed after the 31st day of March, 1970. 482 These provisions relate to development rebate. A deduction was also available to an assessee in respect of profits and gains from specified industries in the case of certain companies prior to April 1, 1968. Section 80E provided: ""80E (1) In the case of a company to which this  Page 4 of 7 section applies, where the total income (as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act) includes any profits and gains attributable to the business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power or of construction, manufacture or production of any one or (- more of the articles or things specified in the list in the Fifth Schedule, there shall be allowed a deduction from such pro fits and gains of an amount equal to eight per cent. thereof in computing the total income of the company."" Section 80E was deleted with effect from April 1, 1968 and was substituted by s. 80-I which provides: ""80-I(1) In the case of a company to which this section ap plies, where the gross total income includes any profits and gains attributable to any priority industry, there shall be allowed, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section, a deduction from such profits and gains of an amount equal to eight per cent, thereof, in computing the total income of the company."" It is not disputed between the parties that the assessee is a company to which the provisions of s. 80E and subsequently of s. 80I will apply. Section 80I, it may be noted, was deleted by the Finance Act, 1972 with effect from April 1, 1973. With effect from April 1, 1968 the expression ’priority industry’ was defined in s. 80B(7) as meaning: ""the business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power or of construction, manufacture or production of any one or more of the articles or things specified in the list in the Fifth Schedule or the business of any hotel where such business is carried on by an Indian company and the hotel is for the time being approved in this behalf by the Central Government."" 483 The word ’Sixth’ was substituted for ’Fifth’ by the Finance Act 1968 A with effect from April 1, 1969. With effect from April 1, 1964 the Fifth Schedule set forth a list of articles and things and items 7, 17 and 24 which possess some relevance to this case read as follows: ""(7) Equipment for the generation and transmission of electricity including transformers, cables and transmission towers, (17) Electronic equipment, namely, radar equipment, computers, electronic accounting and business machines, electronic communication equipment, electronic control instruments and basic components, such as valves, transistors, resisters, condensors, coils, magnetic materials and microwave components, (24) Component parts of the articles mentioned in items Nos. (4), (5), (7) and (9), that is to say, such parts as are essential for the working of the machinery referred to in the items aforesaid and have been given for that purpose some special shape or quality which would not be essential for their use for any other purpose and are in comp lete finished form and ready for fitment."" The Sixth Schedule which replaced the Fifth Schedule with effect from April 1, 1969 contained identical items 7,17 and 24.  Page 5 of 7 These appeals relate to the assessment years 1966-67 to 1971-72. The assessee carries on the business of manufacture and sale of insulated copper wires. Before the Income Tax officer, it claimed that it constituted a priority industry for the purposes of the provisions of ss. 33(1)(iii)(c)(A) and 80E read with items 7, 17 and 24 of the Fifth Schedule of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the first two years and sections 33(1)(b)(B)(i) and 80-1 read with items 7, 17 and 24 of the Fifth or the Sixth Schedule, as the case may be, of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the latter four years. The assessee claimed that it was entitled to the benefits conferred by those provisions for the aforesaid assessment years as a ’priority industry’. It asserted that the wires manufactured by it were covered by the word ’cables’ employed in the articles and things specified in items 7, 17 and 24 of the Fifth Schedule 484 for the assessment years 1966-67, 1967-68 and 1968-69 and items 7, 17 and 24 of the Sixth Schedule of the Income Tax Act for the assessment years 1969-70 to 1971-72. It produced expert evidence in support of its claim. The Income Tax officer rejected the claim made by the assessee. An appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was dismissed. The assessee then appealed to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The Appellate Tribunal allowed the six appeals and held that the assessee was entitled to the benefits claimed by it as a ’prority industry’. It noted that although the assessee had based its claim on items 7, 17 and 24 of the Schedules, the claim was emphatically pressed in the hearing before it under item 7 alone. The question before it then was limited to the point whether the wires manufactured by the asses see fell within item 7. In disposing of the appeals, the Appellate Tribunal adverted to its finding in the appeals for the two immediately preceding assessment years 1964-65 and 1965-66. In its appellate order for the assessment year 1964-65 it found that the assessee manufactured aluminium cables which were used in the transmission of electricity and held that, therefore, it was entitled to the benefit of the Fifth Schedule relevant for those two assessment years. In the appeal pertaining to the assessment year 1965-66 it considered the matter again and upheld the claim in view of its order for the preceding assessment year. It noted that the Revenue had accepted the orders and had not questioned them in reference. It found from a perusal of the Industrial Licences on the basis of which the assessee was operating that there was no change in the nature or type of the goods manufactured by it during the six assessment years before it in appeal. It observed that when it referred to aluminium cables in its earlier orders it should have described them as copper and aluminium cables. Having regard to the material before it, the Appellate Tribunal found no reason to change its opinion from the view taken in the preceding assessment years that the manufacture of the cables attracted the benefits claimed by the assessee. Thereafter, at the instance of the Revenue, the Appellate Tribunal made a reference for the six assessment years to the High Court of Punjab and Haryana for its opinion on the following two questions: ""Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the assessee-company was entitled to the benefits conferred by the provisions of sections 33(1)(iii)(c)(a) and 80E of the Income Tax Act, 1961? 485 2. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances  Page 6 of 7 of the case, the assessee-company was entitled to the benefits conferred by the provisions of sections 33(1)(b)(B)(i) and 80-I of the Income Tax Act, 1961?"" The High Court answered those questions in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee. The High Court differed from the Appellate Tribunal and took the view that in the cases for the assessment years under consideration the Income Tax officer had come into possession of fresh facts indicating that the assessee was manufacturing copper wires of a particular type known as winding wires which were exclusively used in the manufacture of different types of gadgets and not for the purpose of generation and transmission of electricity. It observed that the wires were not meant for the generation and transmission of electricity, and they would fall within item 7 only if they were meant solely for that purpose and not otherwise. In these appeals it is contended on behalf of the assessee that the High Court has misconstrued the facts found by the Appellate Tribunal and has, therefore, erroneously held that the cables manufactured by the assessee do not fall within the scope of item 7. It is urged also that the true test for determining whether the cables could be used in the generation and transmission of electricity was that laid down by the Madras High Court in Commissioner of Income-Tax, Tamil Nadu-V v. Dhandayuthapani Foundry (Private) Ltd., [1980] 123 l.T.R. 709 where in considering the question whether an implement could be described as an agricultural implement it was observed that the real test was not whether it was exclusively used for agricultural purposes but whether it was commonly so used and whether it was intimately and directly connected with agricultural operations. The point before us is whether the cables manufactured by the assessee qualify for inclusion in item 7 of the Fifth Schedule or the Sixth Schedule, as the case may be having regard to the relevant assessment year. Item 7 speaks of equipment for the generation and transmission of electricity, and such equipment includes transformers, cables and trans- mission towers. To appreciate what is comprehended in item 7, it is permissible to refer to a related entry, item 24, which refers to component parts of the articles mentioned, inter alia, in item 7. When item 24 is read in its entirety, it is apparent that the component parts mentioned therein are component parts of what can be described as machinery. Then reading item 7 in conjunction with item 24, the con 486 clusion is inescapable that when item 7 speaks of equipment, reference is intended to machinery needed for the generation and transmission of electricity. The item envisages complete self-contained units of equipment, units which on being put together or connected together constitute the apparatus for the generation and transmission of electricity. Viewed in that context, the reference in item 7 to cables must mean cables identifiable as a complete self-contained unit in themselves as a distinct unit of equipment when employed in the generation and transmission of electricity. A cable does not fall within item 7 if it is merely a component, or part of a component, of a unit of equipment or machinery. The High Court is right in our opinion, in holding that the Appellate Tribunal erred in ignoring the fresh evidence gathered by the Income Tax officer and considered by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner in the assessment proceedings under consideration. The sales accounts of the  Page 7 of 7 assessee showed that the assessee had sold winding wires used in the manufacture of different types of electrical gadgets and for the purpose of transmission of electricity. These are winding wires, employed in coils, winding of armatures, etc. and can not be identified at all as cables in the sense in which item 7 conceives of cables. That being so, the test propounded in Commissioner of Income-Tax, Tamil Nadu-V v. Dhandayuthapani Foundry (Private) Ltd. (supra) does not call for consideration. In the circumstances, the questions referred to the High Court for its opinion were rightly answered in the negative, in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee. In the result, the appeals are dismissed with costs. M.L.A. Appeals dismissed"

65,,BHAGWAT SINGH,COMMISSIONER OF POLICE AND ANR.,25/04/1985,"BENCH: BHAGWATI, P.N. BENCH: BHAGWATI, P.N. SEN, AMARENDRA NATH (J) MADON, D.P.","JUDGMENT: ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Contempt Petition No. 4998 of 1983 IN CRIMINAL WRIT PETITION NO. 6607 Of 1981 Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India Kapil Sibal, A.C. and Ms. Madhu Singh for the petitioner S.C. Maheshwari, G.D. Gupta and R.N. Poddar for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J. The short question that arises for consideration in this writ petition is whether in a case where First Information Report is lodged and after completion of investigation initiated on the basis of the First Information Report, the police submits a report that no offence appears to have been committed, the Magistrate can accept the report and drop the proceeding without issuing notice to the first informant or to the injured or in case the incident has resulted in death, to the relatives of the deceased. It is not necessary to state the facts giving rise to this writ petition, because so far as this writ petition is concerned, we have already directed by our order dated 28th November, 1983 that before any final order is passed on the report of the Central Bureau of 1: Investigation by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, the petitioner who is the father of the unfortunate Gurinder Kaur should be heard. Gurinder Kaur died as a result of burns received by her and allegedly she was burnt by her husband and his parents on account of failure to satisfy their demand for dowry. The circumstances in which Gurinder Kaur met with her unnatural death were investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation and a report was filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on 11th August, 1982 stating that in their opinion in respect of the unnatural death of Gurinder Kaur no offence appeared to have been committed. The petitioner was however not aware that such a report had been submitted by the Central Bureau of Investigation and he, therefore, brought an application for initiating proceedings for contempt against the Central Bureau of Investigation on the ground that the Central Bureau of Investigation had not completed their investigation and submitted their report within the period stipulated by the Court by its earlier order dated 6th May, 1983. lt was in reply to this application for initiation of contempt proceedings that 945 the Central Bureau of Investigation intimated that they had already filed their report in the Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on 11th August, 1982 and the report was pending consideration by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. When this fact was brought to our notice we  Page 4 of 7 immediately passed an order dated 28th November, 1983 directing that the petitione !should be heard before any final order was passed on the report. There was no objection on the part of the respondents to the making of this order, but since the question whether in cases of this kind, the first informant or any relative of the deceased or any other aggrieved person is entitled to be heard at the time of consideration of the report by the Magistrate and whether the Magistrate is bound to issue notice to any such person, is a question of general importance which is likely to arise frequently in criminal proceedings, we thought that it would be desirable to finally settle this question so as to afford guidance to the courts of magistrates all over the country and we accordingly proceeded to hear the arguments on both sides in regard to this question. It is necessary to refer to a few provisions of the Code of Criminal procedure, 1973 in order to arrive at a proper determination of this question. Chapter XII of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 deals with information to the police and their powers to investigate. Sub-section (1) of Section 154 provides that every information relating to the commission of a congizable offence, if given orally to an officer-in-charge of a police station, shall be reduced in writing by him or under his direction and be read over to the informant and every such information, whether given in writing or reduced to writing, shall be signed by the person giving it and sub-section (2) of that section requires that a copy of P such information shall be given forthwith, free of cost, to the informant. Section 156 sub-section (1) vests in the officer-in-charge of a police station the power to investigate any cognizable case without the order of a magistrate and sub-section (3) of that section authorises the magistrate empowered under Section 190 to order an investigation as mentioned in sub-section (1) of that section. Section 157 sub-section (1) lays down that if, from information received or otherwise an officer in charge of a police station has reason to suspect the commission of an offence which he is empowered under Section 156 to investigate, he shall forthwith send a report of the same to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of such offence 946 upon a police report and shall proceed to the spot to investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and, if necessary, to take measures for the discovery and arrest of the offender. But there are of the First Information Report lodged by him. No sooner he lodges the First Information Report, a copy of it has to be supplied to him, free of cost, under sub-section (2) of Section 154. If, two provisos to this sub-section. Proviso (b) enacts that if it appears to the officer-in-charge of a police station that there is no sufficient ground for entering on an investigation, he shall not investigate the case, but in such a case, sub section (2) of Section 157 requires that the officer shall forthwith notify to the informant the fact that he will not investigate the case or cause it to be investigated. What the officer in charge of a police station is required to do on completion of the investigation is set out in section 173. Sub-section (2)(i) of Section 173 provides that as soon as investigation is completed, the officer in charge of a police station shall forward to the magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence on a police report, a report in the form prescribed by the State Government setting out various particulars including whether, in the opinion of the officer, as offence appears to have been committed and if so, by whom. Sub-section (2)(ii) of Section 173 states that  Page 5 of 7 the officer shall also communicate, in such manner as may be prescribed by the State Government, the action taken by him to the person, if any, by whom the information relating to the commission of the offence was first given. Section 190 sub-section (1) then proceeds to enact that any’ magistrate of the first class and any magistrate of the second class specially empowered in this behalf under sub-section (2) may take cognizance of any offence: (a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence or (b) upon a police report of such facts or (c) upon information received from any person other than a police officer, or upon his own knowledge, that such offence has been committed. We are concerned in this case only with clause (b), because the question we are examining here is whether the magistrate is bound to issue notice to the first informant or to the injured or to any relative of the deceased when he is considering the police report submitted under section 173 sub-section (2). It will be seen from the provisions to which we have referred in the preceding paragraph that when an informant lodges the First Information Report with the officer-in charge of a police 947 station he does not fade away with the lodging of the First Information Report. He is very much concerned with what action is initiated by the officer in charge of the police station on the basis of the First Information Report lodged by him. On sooner he lodges the First Information Report, a copy of it has to be supplied him, free of cost, under sub section (2) of Section 154. if. notwithstanding the First Information Report, the officer-in-charge of a police station decides not to investigate the case on the view that there is no sufficient ground for entering on an investigation, he is required under sub-section (2) of Section 157 to notify to the informant the fact that he is not going to investigate the case because it to be investigated. Then again, the officer in charge of a police station is obligated under sub-section(2)(ii) of Section 173 to communicate the action taken by him to the informant and the report forwarded by him to the magistrate under sub section (2)(i) has therefore to be supplied by him to the informant. The question immediately arises as to why action taken by the officer in charge of a police station on the First Information Report is required to be communicated and the report forwarded to the Magistrate under sub-section (2)(i) of Section 173 required to be supplied to the informant. Obviously, the reason is that the informant who sets the machinery of investigation into motion by filing the First Information Report must know what is the result of the investigation initiated on the basis of the First Information Report. The informant having taken the initiative in lodging the First Information Report with a view to initiating investigation by the police for the purpose of ascertaining whether any offence has been committed and, if so, by whom, is vitally interested in the result of the investigation and hence the law requires that the action taken by the officer-in-charge of a police station on the First Information Report should be communicated to him and the report forwarded by such officer to the Magistrate under sub-section (2)(i) of Section 173 should also be supplied to him. Now, when the report forwarded by the officer-in charge of a police station to the Magistrate under sub-section (2)(i) of Section 173 comes up for consideration by the Magistrate, one of two different situations may arise. The  Page 6 of 7 report may conclude that an offence appears to have been committed by a particular person or persons and in such a case, the Magistrate may do one of three things: (1) he may accept the report and take cognizance of the offence and issue process or (2) he may disagree with the report and 948 drop the proceeding or (3) he may direct further investigation under sub-section (3) of Section 156 and require the police to make a further report. The report may on the other hand state that, in the opinion of the police, no offence apppears to have been committed and where such a report has been made, the Magistrate again has an option to adopt one of three courses: (1) he may accept the report and drop the proceeding or (2) he may disagree with the report and taking the view that there is sufficient ground for proceeding further, take cognizance of the offence and issue process or (3) he may direct further investigation to be made by the police under sub-section (3) of Section 156. Where, in either of these two situations, the Magistrate decides to take cognizance of the offence and to issue process, the informant is not prejudicially affected nor is the injured or in case of death, any relative of the deceased aggrieved, because cognizance of the offence is taken by the Magistrate and it is decided by the Magistrate that the case shall proceed. But if the Magistrate decides that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding further and drops the proceeding or takes the view that though there is sufficient ground for proceeding against some, there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against others mentioned in the First Information Report, the informant would certainly be prejudiced because the First Information Report lodged by him would have failed of its purpose, wholly or in part. Moreover, when the interest of the informant in prompt and effective action being taken on the First Information Report lodged by him is clearly recognised by the provisions contained in sub-section (2) of Section 154, sub section (2) of Section 157 and sub-section (2)(ii) of Section 173, it must be presumed that the informant would equally be interested in seeing that the Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence and issues process, because that would be culmination of the First Information Report lodged by him. There can, therefore, be no doubt that when, on a consideration of the report made by the officer in charge of a police station under sub-section (2)(i) of Section 173, the Magistrate is not inclined to take cognizance of the offence and issue process, the informant must be given an opportunity of being heard so that he can make his submissions to persuade the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence and issue process. We are accordingly of the view that in a case where the magistrate to whom a report is forwarded under sub-section (2)(i) of Section 173 decides not to take cognizance of the offence and to drop the proceeding or takes the 949 view that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against some of the persons mentioned in the First Information Report, the magistrate must give notice to the informant and provide him an opportunity to be heard at the time of consideration of the report. It was urged before us on behalf of the respondents that if in such a case notice is required to be given to the informant, it might result in unnecessary delay on account of the difficulty of effecting service of the notice on the informant. But we do not think this can be regarded as a valid objection against the view we are taking, because in any case the action taken by the  Page 7 of 7 police on the First Information Report has to be communicated to the informant and a copy of the report has to be supplied to him under sub-section (2) (i) of Section 173 if that be so, we do not see any reason why it should be difficult to serve notice of the consideration of the report on the informant. Moreover, in any event, the difficulty of service of notice on the informant connot possibly provide any justification for depriving the informant of the opportunity of being heard at the time when the report is considered by the Magistrate. The position may however, be a little different when we consider the question whether the injured person or a relative of the deceased, who is not the informant, is entitled to notice when the report comes up for consideration by the Magistrate. We connot spell out either from the provisions of the Code of Criminal procedure, 1973 or from the principles of natural justice, any obligation on the Magistrate to issue notice lo the injured person or to a relative of the deceased for providing such person an opportunity to be heard at the time of consideration of the report, unless such person is the informant who has lodged the First Information Report. But even if such person is not entitled to notice from the Magistrate, he can appear before the Magistrate and make his submissions when the report is considered by the Magistrate for the purpose of deciding what action he should take on the report. The injured person or any relative of the deceased, though not entitled to notice from the Magistrate, has locus to appear before the Magistrate at that time of consideration of the report, if he otherwise comes to know that the report is going to be considered by the Magistrate and if he wants to make his submissions in regard to the report, the Magistrate is bound to hear him. We may also observe that even though the Magistrate is not bound to give notice of the hearing fixed for consideration of the report 950 to the injured person or to any relative of the deceased, he may, in the exercise of his discretion, if he so thinks fit, give such notice to the injured person or to any particular relative of or relatives the deceased, but not giving of such notice will not have any invalidating effect on the order which may be made by the Magistrate on a consideration of the report. This is our view in regard to the question which has arisen for consideration before us. Since the question is one of general importance, we would direct that copies of this judgment shall be sent to the High Courts in all the States so that the High Courts may in their turn circulate this judgment amongst the Magistrates within their respective jurisdictions. M.L.A.","JUDGMENT: ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Contempt Petition No. 4998 of 1983 IN CRIMINAL WRIT PETITION NO. 6607 Of 1981 Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India Kapil Sibal, A.C. and Ms. Madhu Singh for the petitioner S.C. Maheshwari, G.D. Gupta and R.N. Poddar for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J. The short question that arises for consideration in this writ petition is whether in a case where First Information Report is lodged and after completion of investigation initiated on the basis of the First Information Report, the police submits a report that no offence appears to have been committed, the Magistrate can accept the report and drop the proceeding without issuing notice to the first informant or to the injured or in case the incident has resulted in death, to the relatives of the deceased. It is not necessary to state the facts giving rise to this writ petition, because so far as this writ petition is concerned, we have already directed by our order dated 28th November, 1983 that before any final order is passed on the report of the Central Bureau of 1: Investigation by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, the petitioner who is the father of the unfortunate Gurinder Kaur should be heard. Gurinder Kaur died as a result of burns received by her and allegedly she was burnt by her husband and his parents on account of failure to satisfy their demand for dowry. The circumstances in which Gurinder Kaur met with her unnatural death were investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation and a report was filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on 11th August, 1982 stating that in their opinion in respect of the unnatural death of Gurinder Kaur no offence appeared to have been committed. The petitioner was however not aware that such a report had been submitted by the Central Bureau of Investigation and he, therefore, brought an application for initiating proceedings for contempt against the Central Bureau of Investigation on the ground that the Central Bureau of Investigation had not completed their investigation and submitted their report within the period stipulated by the Court by its earlier order dated 6th May, 1983. lt was in reply to this application for initiation of contempt proceedings that 945 the Central Bureau of Investigation intimated that they had already filed their report in the Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on 11th August, 1982 and the report was pending consideration by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. When this fact was brought to our notice we  Page 4 of 7 immediately passed an order dated 28th November, 1983 directing that the petitione !should be heard before any final order was passed on the report. There was no objection on the part of the respondents to the making of this order, but since the question whether in cases of this kind, the first informant or any relative of the deceased or any other aggrieved person is entitled to be heard at the time of consideration of the report by the Magistrate and whether the Magistrate is bound to issue notice to any such person, is a question of general importance which is likely to arise frequently in criminal proceedings, we thought that it would be desirable to finally settle this question so as to afford guidance to the courts of magistrates all over the country and we accordingly proceeded to hear the arguments on both sides in regard to this question. It is necessary to refer to a few provisions of the Code of Criminal procedure, 1973 in order to arrive at a proper determination of this question. Chapter XII of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 deals with information to the police and their powers to investigate. Sub-section (1) of Section 154 provides that every information relating to the commission of a congizable offence, if given orally to an officer-in-charge of a police station, shall be reduced in writing by him or under his direction and be read over to the informant and every such information, whether given in writing or reduced to writing, shall be signed by the person giving it and sub-section (2) of that section requires that a copy of P such information shall be given forthwith, free of cost, to the informant. Section 156 sub-section (1) vests in the officer-in-charge of a police station the power to investigate any cognizable case without the order of a magistrate and sub-section (3) of that section authorises the magistrate empowered under Section 190 to order an investigation as mentioned in sub-section (1) of that section. Section 157 sub-section (1) lays down that if, from information received or otherwise an officer in charge of a police station has reason to suspect the commission of an offence which he is empowered under Section 156 to investigate, he shall forthwith send a report of the same to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of such offence 946 upon a police report and shall proceed to the spot to investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and, if necessary, to take measures for the discovery and arrest of the offender. But there are of the First Information Report lodged by him. No sooner he lodges the First Information Report, a copy of it has to be supplied to him, free of cost, under sub-section (2) of Section 154. If, two provisos to this sub-section. Proviso (b) enacts that if it appears to the officer-in-charge of a police station that there is no sufficient ground for entering on an investigation, he shall not investigate the case, but in such a case, sub section (2) of Section 157 requires that the officer shall forthwith notify to the informant the fact that he will not investigate the case or cause it to be investigated. What the officer in charge of a police station is required to do on completion of the investigation is set out in section 173. Sub-section (2)(i) of Section 173 provides that as soon as investigation is completed, the officer in charge of a police station shall forward to the magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence on a police report, a report in the form prescribed by the State Government setting out various particulars including whether, in the opinion of the officer, as offence appears to have been committed and if so, by whom. Sub-section (2)(ii) of Section 173 states that  Page 5 of 7 the officer shall also communicate, in such manner as may be prescribed by the State Government, the action taken by him to the person, if any, by whom the information relating to the commission of the offence was first given. Section 190 sub-section (1) then proceeds to enact that any’ magistrate of the first class and any magistrate of the second class specially empowered in this behalf under sub-section (2) may take cognizance of any offence: (a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence or (b) upon a police report of such facts or (c) upon information received from any person other than a police officer, or upon his own knowledge, that such offence has been committed. We are concerned in this case only with clause (b), because the question we are examining here is whether the magistrate is bound to issue notice to the first informant or to the injured or to any relative of the deceased when he is considering the police report submitted under section 173 sub-section (2). It will be seen from the provisions to which we have referred in the preceding paragraph that when an informant lodges the First Information Report with the officer-in charge of a police 947 station he does not fade away with the lodging of the First Information Report. He is very much concerned with what action is initiated by the officer in charge of the police station on the basis of the First Information Report lodged by him. On sooner he lodges the First Information Report, a copy of it has to be supplied him, free of cost, under sub section (2) of Section 154. if. notwithstanding the First Information Report, the officer-in-charge of a police station decides not to investigate the case on the view that there is no sufficient ground for entering on an investigation, he is required under sub-section (2) of Section 157 to notify to the informant the fact that he is not going to investigate the case because it to be investigated. Then again, the officer in charge of a police station is obligated under sub-section(2)(ii) of Section 173 to communicate the action taken by him to the informant and the report forwarded by him to the magistrate under sub section (2)(i) has therefore to be supplied by him to the informant. The question immediately arises as to why action taken by the officer in charge of a police station on the First Information Report is required to be communicated and the report forwarded to the Magistrate under sub-section (2)(i) of Section 173 required to be supplied to the informant. Obviously, the reason is that the informant who sets the machinery of investigation into motion by filing the First Information Report must know what is the result of the investigation initiated on the basis of the First Information Report. The informant having taken the initiative in lodging the First Information Report with a view to initiating investigation by the police for the purpose of ascertaining whether any offence has been committed and, if so, by whom, is vitally interested in the result of the investigation and hence the law requires that the action taken by the officer-in-charge of a police station on the First Information Report should be communicated to him and the report forwarded by such officer to the Magistrate under sub-section (2)(i) of Section 173 should also be supplied to him. Now, when the report forwarded by the officer-in charge of a police station to the Magistrate under sub-section (2)(i) of Section 173 comes up for consideration by the Magistrate, one of two different situations may arise. The  Page 6 of 7 report may conclude that an offence appears to have been committed by a particular person or persons and in such a case, the Magistrate may do one of three things: (1) he may accept the report and take cognizance of the offence and issue process or (2) he may disagree with the report and 948 drop the proceeding or (3) he may direct further investigation under sub-section (3) of Section 156 and require the police to make a further report.

(J)","JUDGMENT: ORIGINAL JURISDICTION : Civil Misc. Petition No. 24899 of 1982. (For Contempt of Court) In Special Leave Petition (C) No. 9661 of 1981. From the Judgment and Order dated the 30 September, 1981 of the Madras High Court at Madras in O.S.A. No. 148 of 1981 arising in Company Petition No. 30 of 1981. G. Vasant Pai, O. C Mathur, S. Sukumaran and D. N. Mishra with him for the petitioner. S.K. Jain and S. Ramaswamy for the Contemner. P.M. Kumaraswamy @ Kailaimannan was present in person. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, C.J. While special leave petition No. 9661 of 1981 (National Textile Workers’ Union v. P.R. Ramakrishnan) was being argued before a five Judge Bench on September 8, 1982, Shri G. Vasantha Pai, who was appearing on behalf of the respondents, drew the attention of the Court to certain statements which had appeared in the Press under the name of one P.M. Kumaraswamy alias Kailaimannan. On a petition presented by Shri Pai on behalf of one R. Baba Chandresekhar under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, the Court issued a notice to P. Kumaraswamy asking him to show cause why he should not be committed for committing contempt of Court. 14 Thereafter, the Contempt Petition came up for hearing before us on various dates. On some of those dates the contemner asked for adjournment on the ground of his illness while on some dates he remained absent. On one occasion, he was absent without informing the Court as to the reasons of his absence. At long last, the contempt petition was heard at some length on March 30, 1983. On a motion made by Shri S.K. Jain. Advocate, on behalf of the contemner, the latter was permitted to argue his case in person, in Tamil. Another Advocate whom the contemner had engaged, Shri S.Ramaswamy, translated the contemnor’s argument in to English for our benefit. One of us, namely, Varadarajan, J., of course knows Tamil. We reserved our Judgment on that date and directed that the matter be listed for Judgment on April 26, 1983. We observed that the contemner may, if so advised, tender a written apology to this Court as also to each of the four Learned Judges of the Madras High Court against whom he had made unfounded allegations, namely, Justice Gokulakrishnan, Justice Ramanujam, Justice V. Ramaswami and Justice  Page 3 of 6 Shunmugham. We directed that the apologies be tendered in writing, if at all, by April 7, 1983 and be published on the front page of the two so-called newspapers, ’International Chronicle’ and ’Sigappu Nada’, which the contemner conducts. The contemner submitted a written apology to this Court on March 30, itself, to the following effect: ""I state that I understand that my writings created an impression in the mind of this Hon’ble Court that the articles are contemptuous in nature. I am therefore submitting my sincere and honest apology to this Hon’ble Court and also to Mr. Justice Gokulakrishnan, Mr. Justice Ramanujam, Mr. Justice Shunmugham of the Madras High Court and I am extremely sorry for writing the impugned article. I further undertake not to write anything against the Madras High Court Judges in my journals ’Sigappu Nada’ and International Chronicle’ in future. I also undertake to publish the text of this affidavit in the above said two journals."" How hollow and unmeaning the apology was, is clear from the fact that within 10 days after submitting the apology to this Court, 15 the contemner published an article in ’Sigappu Nada’ on April 8, 1983 purporting to give an account of what had transpired in this Court on March 30, 1983. This is what he says in the said issue of his journal : ""The Court told me We convict you to the maximum punishment of six months imprisonment and Rs. 1,000 fine; if you tender apology, we will consider. Under the circumstances, what can I do ? I agreed for tendering apology. After this, they told me that I have to appear before each and every Judges about whom, I have written in my paper and tender apology. Since, I have accepted for the first apology, I have agreed for this also."" On April 14, 1983 the contemner came out with a front page article in ’Sigappu Nada’ in which he has stated as follows : ""Kailaimannan is ready to go to Jail In the case filed against me in the Supreme Court, Judgment is to be delivered on 26.4.1983. The Judgment has been announced already it has been published as news item in Newspapers. The Supreme Court has ordered that I must go to four of the High Court Judges personally and tender apology. But my conscience does not permit me to tender apology to them. I have decided to go to Jail, rather than tendering apology to them. But my case will make a new turn in India. I do not wish to say anything about it now. My enemies are jubilant that ’Kailaimannan’ will be finished with this. Sigappu Nada will not be published hereafter. Even if I go to Jail, Sigappu Nada will be published continuously. 16 How can the corruption of a Judge be proved in the Supreme Court. Only if C.B.I. enquiry is ordered on the counter filed by me, truth will be known. For that, Supreme Court has not done anything and it is the highest Court. I have written to the Secretary, Home Department, Central Government, seeking for permission to file complaints against two Judges regarding corruption  Page 4 of 6 charges. As soon as sanction is given, I will file the case against the two Judges in Court and I will prove that those corruption news published by me are true only. If I do not prove those charges, it will not be conducive to my self-respect."" The apology tendered by the contemner to this Court on March 30 was thus a mere device to escape punishment for his culpable conduct. He has no real repentance for the wanton charges of corruption made by him against the four Judges of the Madras High Court. He has committed a breach of the undertaking given by him to this Court to the effect that he will not make similar charges against the Madras High Court Judges and that he will publish his apology in the two journals. Far from carrying out that undertaking, he has ventured into another bout of scurrilous writings against the High Court Judges. His pose now is of injured innocence. And, he warns that he will not apologise to those Judges and that he will persist in his campaign of vilification. Incidentally, he never apologised to Justice V. Ramaswami, with or without contrition. We do not propose to give publicity to the grossly defamatory allegations made by the contemner, by reproducing them in our Judgment. The gist of those allegations is that certain Judgments given by the four Judges of the High Court proceeded from corrupt motives. The contemner seems to think that he can deter the Judges from discharging their duty by maligning them before the public, by alleging that their judgments are influenced by corrupt motives. The fact that the contemner has made allegations of corruption against the four Judges is not denied by him and indeed, he stated before us that he wanted an opportunity to establish those 17 allegations. If we were to grant him such an opportunity, that would have aggravated the contempt. A reckless and malicious person like the contemner could have borrowed the support of some disgruntled litigants of his own feather to aid and abet him. Even then, in order to test the bona fides of the contemner, we asked him to furnish to us a list of the names of persons, particularly advocates, whose affidavits he proposed to file in support of the charges of corruption levelled by him against the High Court Judges. He did scribble a few names in our presence but that was the end of the matter. He conveniently forgot all about his tall claim that he will be able to get the affidavits of even practising lawyers in support of his case. It is clear that the contemner was only trying to trick the Court into believing that he is not a lone fighter in his demand for justice against the four dispensers of justice. No one came forward to support him. No one possibly could. He is not fighting in the cause of justice. He has become an enemy of the Courts because certain decisions given by them are not to his liking. ""I will leave you alone, if you decide in my favour. I will charge you of corruption if you dare to decide against me"" -That sums up his attitude to the Courts. Judges must tread their path of rectitude uneterred by such threats. This Court is there to protect them from scurrilous accusations prompted by malice. The conduct and writings of the contemner constitute serious interference with the administration of justice, since his sole object in giving publicity to the defamatory allegations against the High Court Judges is to deter them from deciding cases against him or against those in whom he is apparently interested. The apology tendered by him is an eye-wash, a make-belief, and cannot be accepted. In fact,  Page 5 of 6 there is no apology to accept because he has resiled from it. He is penitent for having apologised to the High Court Judges whose character he has assailed without the semblance of sincerity of purpose or purity of means. He is not penitent for his conduct. We are inclined to believe that the writings in the two journals conducted by the contemner are inspired by some others who are working from behind the curtain. They appear to have promoted the contemner to speak and write with such great venom. But the fact that the contemner is acting at the behest of undisclosed principals is not an extenuating circumstance. Indeed, many hirelings are equally despicable, since they charge their price for blackmail. 18 We hold that the conduct of the contemner constitutes serious interference with the course of justice. He has exhibited a dogged determination to pursue the four Judges of the High Court, come what may. He is not sorry for his ways. He is sorry that he was even apparently sorry. Perhaps, having charged his price, he has to play to the tune of his masters. Very often, contemners are so contemptible that it is useless to take any serious notice of their conduct. We are compelled to take action in this case because nothing else will stop this systematic campaign of vilification against the defenceless Judges of the High Court. As we were coming to the end of this Judgment, a communication was received from before the contemner, which is filed by his Advocate, Shri S. K. Jain. That communication contains an additional affidavit affirmed by the contemner at Madras on April 28, 1983. He says therein : ""I wholeheartedly and sincerely tender my apologies before this Hon’ble Court if this Hon’ble Court feels that I have committed contempt by my writings. I also undertake that I will not write anything about the Hon’ble Judges of the High Court in my journals ""Sigappu Nada,‘ and International Chronicle"" About the other two conditions, I would like to submit the following few lines for the benevolent consideration and sympathetic approach of this Hon’ble Court."" In paragraph 5 of the said affidavit he says that he is a freedom fighter, that he was arrested during freedom movement at the early age of 18 and that he was detained under MISA during the emergency. ""So prison life is not new to me"". After saying all this, he has reiterated in paragraph 7 of the affidavit that though he is unable to justify his writings and substantiate his allegations ’at present’, he was certain that he will be able to do so. He says that he has already addressed a letter to the Government of India and the Government of Tamilnadu for according sanction to prosecute ""corrupt Judges for offences punishable under section 161 IPC and the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act"". He winds up the affidavit by saying that he believes that he will be able to prove that his writings contain the truth. Any comment on this affidavit is superfluous. 19 For the reasons abovesaid, we convict the contemner under section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 and sentence him to suffer simple imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000. He shall be taken in custody forthwith. If he is suffering from any physical ailment, care ought to be taken of the state of his body.

No. 148 of 1981 arising in Company Petition No. 30 of 1981. G. Vasant Pai, O. C Mathur, S. Sukumaran and D. N. Mishra with him for the petitioner. S.K. Jain and S. Ramaswamy for the Contemner. P.M. Kumaraswamy @ Kailaimannan was present in person. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, C.J. While special leave petition No. 9661 of 1981 (National Textile Workers’ Union v. P.R. Ramakrishnan) was being argued before a five Judge Bench on September 8, 1982, Shri G. Vasantha Pai, who was appearing on behalf of the respondents, drew the attention of the Court to certain statements which had appeared in the Press under the name of one P.M. Kumaraswamy alias Kailaimannan. On a petition presented by Shri Pai on behalf of one R. Baba Chandresekhar under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, the Court issued a notice to P. Kumaraswamy asking him to show cause why he should not be committed for committing contempt of Court. 14 Thereafter, the Contempt Petition came up for hearing before us on various dates. On some of those dates the contemner asked for adjournment on the ground of his illness while on some dates he remained absent. On one occasion, he was absent without informing the Court as to the reasons of his absence. At long last, the contempt petition was heard at some length on March 30, 1983. On a motion made by Shri S.K. Jain. Advocate, on behalf of the contemner, the latter was permitted to argue his case in person, in Tamil. Another Advocate whom the contemner had engaged, Shri S.Ramaswamy, translated the contemnor’s argument in to English for our benefit. One of us, namely, Varadarajan, J., of course knows Tamil. We reserved our Judgment on that date and directed that the matter be listed for Judgment on April 26, 1983. We observed that the contemner may, if so advised, tender a written apology to this Court as also to each of the four Learned Judges of the Madras High Court against whom he had made unfounded allegations, namely, Justice Gokulakrishnan, Justice Ramanujam, Justice V. Ramaswami and Justice  Page 3 of 6 Shunmugham. We directed that the apologies be tendered in writing, if at all, by April 7, 1983 and be published on the front page of the two so-called newspapers, ’International Chronicle’ and ’Sigappu Nada’, which the contemner conducts. The contemner submitted a written apology to this Court on March 30, itself, to the following effect: ""I state that I understand that my writings created an impression in the mind of this Hon’ble Court that the articles are contemptuous in nature. I am therefore submitting my sincere and honest apology to this Hon’ble Court and also to Mr. Justice Gokulakrishnan, Mr. Justice Ramanujam, Mr. Justice Shunmugham of the Madras High Court and I am extremely sorry for writing the impugned article. I further undertake not to write anything against the Madras High Court Judges in my journals ’Sigappu Nada’ and International Chronicle’ in future. I also undertake to publish the text of this affidavit in the above said two journals."" How hollow and unmeaning the apology was, is clear from the fact that within 10 days after submitting the apology to this Court, 15 the contemner published an article in ’Sigappu Nada’ on April 8, 1983 purporting to give an account of what had transpired in this Court on March 30, 1983. This is what he says in the said issue of his journal : ""The Court told me We convict you to the maximum punishment of six months imprisonment and Rs. 1,000 fine; if you tender apology, we will consider. Under the circumstances, what can I do ? I agreed for tendering apology. After this, they told me that I have to appear before each and every Judges about whom, I have written in my paper and tender apology. Since, I have accepted for the first apology, I have agreed for this also."" On April 14, 1983 the contemner came out with a front page article in ’Sigappu Nada’ in which he has stated as follows : ""Kailaimannan is ready to go to Jail In the case filed against me in the Supreme Court, Judgment is to be delivered on 26.4.1983. The Judgment has been announced already it has been published as news item in Newspapers. The Supreme Court has ordered that I must go to four of the High Court Judges personally and tender apology. But my conscience does not permit me to tender apology to them. I have decided to go to Jail, rather than tendering apology to them. But my case will make a new turn in India. I do not wish to say anything about it now. My enemies are jubilant that ’Kailaimannan’ will be finished with this. Sigappu Nada will not be published hereafter. Even if I go to Jail, Sigappu Nada will be published continuously. 16 How can the corruption of a Judge be proved in the Supreme Court. Only if C.B.I. enquiry is ordered on the counter filed by me, truth will be known. For that, Supreme Court has not done anything and it is the highest Court. I have written to the Secretary, Home Department, Central Government, seeking for permission to file complaints against two Judges regarding corruption  Page 4 of 6 charges. As soon as sanction is given, I will file the case against the two Judges in Court and I will prove that those corruption news published by me are true only. If I do not prove those charges, it will not be conducive to my self-respect."" The apology tendered by the contemner to this Court on March 30 was thus a mere device to escape punishment for his culpable conduct. He has no real repentance for the wanton charges of corruption made by him against the four Judges of the Madras High Court. He has committed a breach of the undertaking given by him to this Court to the effect that he will not make similar charges against the Madras High Court Judges and that he will publish his apology in the two journals. Far from carrying out that undertaking, he has ventured into another bout of scurrilous writings against the High Court Judges. His pose now is of injured innocence. And, he warns that he will not apologise to those Judges and that he will persist in his campaign of vilification. Incidentally, he never apologised to Justice V. Ramaswami, with or without contrition. We do not propose to give publicity to the grossly defamatory allegations made by the contemner, by reproducing them in our Judgment. The gist of those allegations is that certain Judgments given by the four Judges of the High Court proceeded from corrupt motives. The contemner seems to think that he can deter the Judges from discharging their duty by maligning them before the public, by alleging that their judgments are influenced by corrupt motives. The fact that the contemner has made allegations of corruption against the four Judges is not denied by him and indeed, he stated before us that he wanted an opportunity to establish those 17 allegations. If we were to grant him such an opportunity, that would have aggravated the contempt. A reckless and malicious person like the contemner could have borrowed the support of some disgruntled litigants of his own feather to aid and abet him. Even then, in order to test the bona fides of the contemner, we asked him to furnish to us a list of the names of persons, particularly advocates, whose affidavits he proposed to file in support of the charges of corruption levelled by him against the High Court Judges. He did scribble a few names in our presence but that was the end of the matter. He conveniently forgot all about his tall claim that he will be able to get the affidavits of even practising lawyers in support of his case. It is clear that the contemner was only trying to trick the Court into believing that he is not a lone fighter in his demand for justice against the four dispensers of justice. No one came forward to support him. No one possibly could. He is not fighting in the cause of justice. He has become an enemy of the Courts because certain decisions given by them are not to his liking. ""I will leave you alone, if you decide in my favour. I will charge you of corruption if you dare to decide against me"" -That sums up his attitude to the Courts. Judges must tread their path of rectitude uneterred by such threats. This Court is there to protect them from scurrilous accusations prompted by malice. The conduct and writings of the contemner constitute serious interference with the administration of justice, since his sole object in giving publicity to the defamatory allegations against the High Court Judges is to deter them from deciding cases against him or against those in whom he is apparently interested. The apology tendered by him is an eye-wash, a make-belief, and cannot be accepted. In fact,  Page 5 of 6 there is no apology to accept because he has resiled from it. He is penitent for having apologised to the High Court Judges whose character he has assailed without the semblance of sincerity of purpose or purity of means. He is not penitent for his conduct. We are inclined to believe that the writings in the two journals conducted by the contemner are inspired by some others who are working from behind the curtain. They appear to have promoted the contemner to speak and write with such great venom. But the fact that the contemner is acting at the behest of undisclosed principals is not an extenuating circumstance. Indeed, many hirelings are equally despicable, since they charge their price for blackmail. 18 We hold that the conduct of the contemner constitutes serious interference with the course of justice. He has exhibited a dogged determination to pursue the four Judges of the High Court, come what may. He is not sorry for his ways. He is sorry that he was even apparently sorry. Perhaps, having charged his price, he has to play to the tune of his masters. Very often, contemners are so contemptible that it is useless to take any serious notice of their conduct. We are compelled to take action in this case because nothing else will stop this systematic campaign of vilification against the defenceless Judges of the High Court. As we were coming to the end of this Judgment, a communication was received from before the contemner, which is filed by his Advocate, Shri S. K. Jain. That communication contains an additional affidavit affirmed by the contemner at Madras on April 28, 1983. He says therein : ""I wholeheartedly and sincerely tender my apologies before this Hon’ble Court if this Hon’ble Court feels that I have committed contempt by my writings. I also undertake that I will not write anything about the Hon’ble Judges of the High Court in my journals ""Sigappu Nada,‘ and International Chronicle"" About the other two conditions, I would like to submit the following few lines for the benevolent consideration and sympathetic approach of this Hon’ble Court."" In paragraph 5 of the said affidavit he says that he is a freedom fighter, that he was arrested during freedom movement at the early age of 18 and that he was detained under MISA during the emergency. ""So prison life is not new to me"". After saying all this, he has reiterated in paragraph 7 of the affidavit that though he is unable to justify his writings and substantiate his allegations ’at present’, he was certain that he will be able to do so. He says that he has already addressed a letter to the Government of India and the Government of Tamilnadu for according sanction to prosecute ""corrupt Judges for offences punishable under section 161 IPC and the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act"". He winds up the affidavit by saying that he believes that he will be able to prove that his writings contain the truth. Any comment on this affidavit is superfluous. 19 For the reasons abovesaid, we convict the contemner under section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 and sentence him to suffer simple imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000. He shall be taken in custody forthwith. If he is suffering from any physical ailment, care ought to be taken of the state of his body. Those who have spurred him into this kind of activity will take the  Page 6 of 6 care of his mind. P.B.R. Petition allowed"

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, J. The State of Gujarat and the Development Commissioner of the State of Gujarat have filed Civil Appeal No. 359 of 1978 under Article 136 of the Constitution against the judgment, dated January 28th, 1977 passed in Special Civil Application No. 309 of 1975 on the file of the High Court of Gujarat. Respondents Nos. 1 to 5 in the above appeal were the petitioners in the aforesaid Special Civil Application. They had filed the 150 said application with the leave of the High Court in a representative capacity for and on behalf of themselves and other officers and servants who were originally in the employment of several municipalities which had been constituted under the Bombay District Municipal Act, 1901 (hereinafter referred to as ’the Municipal Act’) and who were working as the employees under gram panchayats or nagar panchayats which were established in the place of the municipalities referred to above under the provisions of the Gujarat Panchayats Act, 1961 (Gujarat Act No. VI of 1962) (hereinafter referred to as ’the Panchayats Act’) under Article 226 of the Constitution requesting the High Court to issue an appropriate writ, order or direction to the State of Gujarat and others who had been impleaded as respondents therein directing them (i) to pass orders regarding the appointment of the persons for and on whose behalf the said application had been filed in equivalent posts in the Panchayat Service of the State Government, fixation of their seniority and pay scales and allowances in the equivalent posts with retrospective effect and payment to them of the difference in salary and allowances to which they would become entitled on such fixation of salary and allowances payable to them, (ii) to frame rules providing for promotional avenues to them in the Panchayat Service as also in the State Service and (iii) to extend to them the benefits flowing from the pay revisions ordered by the State Government on the basis of the recommendations of the first Pay Commission (Sarela Commission) and the second Pay Commission (Desai Commission) retrospectively. They also prayed for certain incidental reliefs. Writ Petitions Nos. 4266 to 4270 of 1978 were filed by them before this Court under Article 32 of Constitution in a representative capacity with the leave of this Court requesting the Court to declare the Gujarat Panchayats (Amendment) Ordinance, 1978 (hereinafter referred to as ’the Ordinance’) as unconstitutional, void and of no effect and to grant them such reliefs as may be permissible consequent upon such declaration. After the above writ petitions were filed, the Ordinance was repealed and replaced by the Gujarat Panchayats (Third Amendment) Act, 1978 (Gujarat Act No. 28 of 1978) (hereinafter referred to as ’the Amending Act’). Thereafter the petitioners prayed for an amendment of the writ petitions requesting the Court to permit them to question the validity of the Amending Act in so far as it adversely affected them. Their prayer was accordingly granted. The writ petitions are contested by the State Government. 151 For purposes of convenience, respondents Nos. 1 to 5 in Civil Appeal No. 359 of 1978 who are also petitioners in the writ petitions Nos. 4266 to 4270 of 1978 are hereafter referred to as the petitioners.  Page 8 of 20 Before the Panchayats Act was enacted there existed in the State of Gujarat a number of municipalities constituted under the Municipal Act and the petitioners and those whom they represent in these proceedings by virtue of the leave granted to them to prosecute these proceedings in a representative capacity were employees of such municipalities. The Panchayats Act was enacted for the purpose of consolidating and amending the law relating to village panchayats and district local boards in the State of Gujarat with a view to reorganise the administration pertaining to the local Government in furtherance of the object of democratic decentralisation of powers in favour of different classes of panchayats. It provided for the establishment of panchayats of different tiers viz. a gram panchayat for each gram, a nagar panchayat for each nagar, a taluka panchayat for each taluka and a district panchayat for a district. Section 9 of the Panchayats Act empowered the State Government to declare any local area comprising a revenue village or a group of revenue villages or hamlets forming part of a revenue village or such other administrative unit or part thereof to be a nagar, if the population of such local area exceeded 10,000 but did not exceed 20,000 and to be a gram, if the population of such local area did not exceed 10,000 by issuing a notification in the Official Gazette to that effect. Section 307 of the Panchayats Act provided that where any local area was declared to be a gram or nagar under section 9 and, immediately before such declaration, the local area was co-extensive with the limits of a municipal district or a municipal borough or included an area comprising a municipal district or municipal borough as well as any other area, then with effect from the date on which such local area was so declared to be a gram or nagar, the consequences mentioned therein would ensue notwithstanding anything in the relevant municipal law. Two of the consequences which flowed from such a declaration were that the municipality functioning in such a local area or part thereof would cease to exist and all officers and servants in the employ of the municipality immediately before the said date would become officers and servants of the interim panchayat under the Panchayats Act and shall until other provision was made in accordance with the provisions thereof would receive salaries and allowances and be subject to the conditions of service to which they were entitled or subject on such date. Section 308 of the Panchayats Act required the 152 District Development Officer to take steps to hold election for a new gram panchayat or nagar panchayat, as the case may be, within a period not exceeding one year from the date on which the interim panchayat came into existence. Chapter XI in which sections 203 to 211 of the Panchayats Act are included sets out provisions relating to services. Section 203 of the Panchayats Act prior to the promulgation of the Ordinance read as follows: ""203. (1) For the purpose of bringing about uniform scales of pay and uniform conditions of service for persons employed in the discharge of functions and duties of panchayats, there shall be constituted a Panchayat Service in connection with the affairs of panchayats. Such service shall be distinct from the State Service. (2) The Panchayat Service shall consist of such classes, cadres and posts and the initial strength of officers and servants in each such class and cadre  Page 9 of 20 shall be such, as the State Government may by order from time to time determine: Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall prevent a district panchayat from altering, with the previous approval of the State Government, any class, cadre or number of posts so determined by the State Government. (2A) (a) The cadres referred to in sub-section (2) may consist of district cadres, taluka cadres and local cadres. (b) A servant belonging to a district cadre shall be liable to be posted whether by promotion or transfer to any post in any taluka in the district. (c) A servant belonging to a taluka cadre shall be liable to be posted, whether by promotion or transfer to any post in any gram or nagar in the same taluka. (d) A servant belonging to a local cadre shall be liable to be posted whether by promotion or transfer to any post in the same gram or, as the case may be, nagar. (2B) In addition to the posts in the cadre referred to in sub-section (2A), a panchayat may have such other posts of such classes as the State Government may by general or special order determine. Such posts shall be called ""deputation posts"" and shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of section 207. 153 (3) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the State Government may make rules regulating the mode of recruitment either by holding examinations or otherwise and conditions of service of persons appointed to the panchayat service and the powers in respect of appointments, transfers and promotions of officers and servants in the Panchayat Service and disciplinary action against any such officers or servants. (4) Rules made under sub-section (3) shall in particular contain (a) a provision entitling servants of such cadres in the Panchayat Service to promotion to such cadres in the State Service as may be prescribed. (b) a provision specifying the classes of posts recruitment to which shall be made through the District Panchayat Service Selection Committee and the classes of posts, recruitment to which shall be made by the Gujarat Panchayat Service Selection Board, and (c) a provision regarding the percentage of vacancies to be reserved for the members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes in the Panchayat Service. (5) Such rules may provide for inter-district transfer of servants belonging to the panchayat service and the circumstances in which and the conditions subject to which such transfers may be made. Section 205 of the Panchayats Act states that subject to any rules made under section 203, appointments to the Panchayat Service shall be made (i) by direct recruitment, (ii) by promotion and (iii) by transfer of members of the State Service to the Panchayat Service. Section 206 of the Panchayats Act before the Amending Act was passed empowered the State Government by a general or special order to   20 allocate to the Panchayat Service (i) such number of officers and servants out of the staff allotted or transferred to a panchayat under sections 157, 158 and 325 as it may deem fit, (ii) all officers and servants of the municipalities dissolved under section 307, (iii) all officers and servants in the service of district local boards and district school boards immediately before their dissolution under the Panchayats Act and transferred to the panchayats under sections 155 and 326 and (iv) and other officers and servants employed in the State service as may be necessary to enable the panchayats to discharge efficiently their functions and duties 154 under the Panchayats Act. Section 210 of the Panchayats Act provides for the establishment of a Gujarat Panchayat Service Selection Board for the purpose of recruitment of candidates to the several posts in the Panchayat Service. The provisions contained in Chapter XI of the Panchayats Act may be summarised thus: Section 203 of the Panchayats Act provides for the constitution of a Panchayat Service which shall be distinct from the State Service. The State Government is authorised to determine by orders issued from time to time several classes, cadres and posts in the Panchayat Service and the initial strength of the officers and servants in each such class and cadre. The Panchayat Service may consist of district cadres, taluka cadres and local cadres. A servant belonging to a district cadre is liable to be posted either by promotion or transfer to any post in any taluka in the district, a servant belonging to a taluka cadre is liable to be posted similarly to any post in any gram or nagar in the same taluka and a servant belonging to a local cadre may similarly be posted in the same gram or, as the case may be, nagar. The Panchayat Service may also consist of certain posts designated as deputation posts, which may be filled in accordance with the provisions of section 207. The State Government is empowered to make rules regulating the mode of recruitment and conditions of service of appointments, transfers and promotions of officers and servants of appointments, transfers and promotions of officers and servants in the Panchayat Service and disciplinary action against any such officers or servants. Sub-section (4) of section 203 of the Panchayats Act provides that rules may be made under sub-section (3) thereof containing provisions entitling servants of such cadres in the Panchayats Service to promotion to such cadres in the State Service as may be prescribed. We have noticed earlier that under section 206 of the Panchayats Act, it is open to the State Government to allocate to the Panchayat Service such number of officers and servants out of the staff allotted or transferred to a panchayat under sections 157, 158 and 325 as it may deem fit. Section 157 of the Panchayats Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, the. State Government may subject to such conditions as it may think fit to impose, transfer by an order published in the Official Gazette to a district panchayat any such powers, functions and duties relating to any matter as are exercised or performed by the State Government or any officer of Government under any enactment which the State Legislature is competent to enact, or otherwise in the executive power of the State, and appear 155 to relate to matters arising within a district and to be of an administrative character and shall on such transfer, allot to the district panchayat such fund and personnel as   of 20 may be necessary to enable the district panchayat to exercise the power and discharge the functions and duties so transferred. Sub-section (2) of section 157 sets out some of the departments whose powers, functions and duties that may be transferred under section 157 (1). Section 158 of the Panchayats Act provides that any functions and duties relating to any of the matters specified in the Panchayat Functions List performed before the commencement of that section by the State Government through its officers within a gram, nagar, taluka or district shall, subject to such exceptions as the State Government may by order in writing specify, be transferred to the district panchayat together with the funds provided, and the staff employed therefor. By section 325 of the Panchayats Act, the Bombay Village Panchayats Act, 1958 was repealed and all officers and servants in the employ of the old village panchayats immediately before the said date became the officers and servants of the new gram panchayats established under the Panchayts Act. We shall now briefly refer to some of the steps taken under the Panchayats Act after it came into force on June 15, 1962 in the State of Gujarat except in Kutch area and the district of Dangs. On March 4, 1963 by an order made by the State Government, the areas which were within the jurisdiction of the several municipalities constituted under the Municipal Act were declared to be gram or nagar, as the case may be. On April 1, 1963, sections 203 to 205 of the Panchayats Act were brought into operation. On March 26, 1963, the State Government entrusted some of its functions relating to recovery of land revenue etc. to the nagar and gram panchayats with effect from April 15, 1963. On August 1, 1963 by a notification issued under section 149 of the Panchayats Act, the State Government delegated some of its powers under the Land Revenue Code and rules made thereunder to the gram and nagar panchayats. On July 13, 1964, the Gujarat Panchayat Service (Conduct) Rules, 1964 promulgated under section 203 of the Panchayats Act came into force. On July 16, 1964, the Gujarat Service (Discipline & Appeal) Rules, 1964 came into force. On November 11, 1965, the Gujarat Panchayat Service (Absorption, Seniority, Pay & Allowances) Rules were promulgated. On October 16, 1968, the Gujarat Panchayat Service (Transfer of Servants) Rules, 1968 were promulgated. The Gujarat Panchayat Service (Promotion to cadres in State Service) Rules, 1974 were issued on September 16, 1974. 156 The Gujarat Panchayat Service (Pension) Rules, 1976 were issued on January 9, 1976. The State Government passed an order under sub-section (2) of section 203 of the Panchayats Act of January 2, 1967 directing that the Panchayat Service shall consist of district cadre, taluka cadre and local cadre and specified the posts which were to belong to each of such cadres in the Schedule appended to the said order. In Part III of the Schedule to that Order, the posts belonging to the local cadre with which we are concerned in these cases were specified. It is stated that by certain administrative orders the State Government had also undertaken the liability of reimbursing the panchayats, either wholly or in part in respect of the remuneration paid by them to the specified staff even though under section 204 of the Panchayats Act, the expenditure towards pay, allowances etc. of officers and servants in Panchayat Service should be met out of panchayat funds. Although the above mentioned and some other steps were taken by the State Government under the Panchayats Act   of 20 providing for the constitution of the Panchayat Service, the State Government did not make any order regarding the equation of posts of the staff in the local cadre and fixation of their pay scale till 1975 notwithstanding the fact that repeated representations were made by the ex municipal employees and others who were included in the local cadre. The State Government also failed to extend to the staff borne on the local cadre of the Panchayat Service the benefit of revisions of pay scales and other allowances which were made on the basis of the recommendations of the first Pay Commission (Sarela Commission) and of the second Pay Commission (Desai Commission). The State Government also did not make any rules prescribing the promotional avenues for the staff borne on the local cadre of the Panchayat Service. The petitioners, therefore, filed the Special Civil Application No. 309 of 1975 on the file of the High Court of Gujarat out of which the above appeal arises under Article 226 of the Constitution for several reliefs, referred to above. The said application was resisted by the State of Gujarat and the Development Commissioner who had been impleaded as the respondents. The contentions urged by the petitioners before the High Court among others were that the Panchayat Service was as much a service under the State as any other State Civil Service; that the State Government had failed to discharge its statutory duties in relation to the members of the staff included in the local cadre of the Panchayat Service and that the denial of benefits similar to those extended to other members of the State Civil Service on the basis 157 of the reports of the two Pay Commissions to them amounted to hostile discrimination. The principal contention urged on behalf of the State Government was that the members of the Panchayat Service were not Government servants and, therefore, could not claim the reliefs prayed for by them. In support of the above contention, reliance was placed by the State Government on section 203 (1) of the Panchayats Act which stated that the Panchayat Service was distinct from the State Service. It should be mentioned here that the question whether the Panchayat Service constituted under the Panchayats Act was a Civil Service under the State Government or not arose for consideration before the High Court of Gujarat in G. L. Shukla & Anr. v. The State of Gujarat & Ors.(1). That was a case in which some of the employees of the State Government working in the Public Works Department questioned the constitutional validity of a notification issued by the State Government transferring certain, functions of the Public Works Department to the panchayats and transferring some of the officers and servants working in that department to the Panchayat Service. The petitioners therein who had been allotted to the Panchayat Service under that order contended that the notification was violative of Articles 14, 310 and 311 of the Constitution on the ground that by virtue of the impugned notification, they had been removed from the service of the State Government against their will and in violation of their rights under the Constitution. The High Court dismissed the petition holding that they had not ceased to be Government servants by reason of the allocation of their services to the Panchayat Service. Bhagwati, J. (as he then was) observed in the course of the said decision at page 845 thus: ""When an order of allocation is made under sec. 206, the Government servant who is allocated does not cease to be a State servant and become a servant of the  Page 13 of 20 panchayat. There is no termination of his service as a State servant and the only effect of the order of allocation is that whereas, prior to the order of allocation, he was a member of one civil service of the State, namely, the State Service, he is now, after the order of allocation, a member of another civil service of the State, namely, the panchayat service. He is merely transferred from one civil service of the State to another. The Panchayat Service contemplated under the Act is as much a civil service of the State as the State service. The Legislature by enacting 158 the Act provided for the establishment of the Panchayat Organization of the State and for the efficient administration of the Panchayat Organization, particularly in view of the fact that a large part of the service personnel would be drawn from different sources and would, therefore, be heterogeneous in composition with widely differing scales of pay and conditions of service, the Legislature felt that it would be desirable to have a separate civil service of persons employed in the discharge of functions and duties of panchayats with uniform scales of pay and uniform conditions of service and, therefore with that end in view the Legislature provided for constitution of the panchayat service. All the provisions of the Act relating to the panchayat service point unmistakably and inevitably to one and only one conclusion, namely, that the panchayat service is one single service with the State as the master."" Following the decision in Shukla’s case (supra) the High Court held in the case out of which this appeal arises that the petitioners herein who belonged to the local cadre were Government servants and directed the State Government (i) to issue suitable orders, in so far as the members included in the local cadre were concerned regarding the equivalence of posts, fixation of pay scales for such posts, fixation of the petitioners and the persons whom they represent at an appropriate stage in such pay scales and other incidental matters and to give effect to such orders from the date of allocation of the petitioners and others whom they represent to the Panchayat Service, that is to say, from February 11, 1969, (ii) to fix their initial pay scales and allowances and to revise them in accordance with the orders passed by the State Government in the case of other Government employees on the basis of the first Pay Commission (Sarela Commission) and of the second Pay Commission (Desai Commission) with effect from the dates on which similar benefits were extended to other State Civil Services, and (iii) to consider the question of making suitable provisions in the appropriate rules providing for promotion of members of the local cadre who were formerly the employees of the municipalities. Aggrieved by the directions issued by the High Court, the State Government and the Development Commissioner have filed this appeal. During the pendency of the above appeal, as stated above, the Ordinance was issued by the Governor of Gujarat amending some of the provisions of the Panchayats Act and the said Ordinance was replaced by the Amending Act. As the petitioners felt that their interests were adversely affected by the Ordinance and the Amending Act, they filed the writ petitions referred to above. 159 Although several questions arise for consideration in the above appeal, at this stage we propose to deal with  Page 14 of 20 only the following two contentions as per orders passed by the Court on July 24, 1980: ""(1) Whether the Panchayat Service was a Civil Service of the State and (2) whether under the unamended Act, there was a common centralized Panchayat Service?"" It is well-known that in India experiment in administration of local self Government had been going on for well over a century in almost all British Indian provinces and many princely States that were in existence before the commencement of the Constitution. There were laws having local operation under which different kinds of local self-Government bodies were constituted to enable persons living in different local areas to participate in the administration of such local areas in so far as functions that were delegated to them by law. All those laws continued to be in force even after the commencement of the Constitution. Some of them have since been repealed and replaced by new laws. Municipal corporations, city municipalities, town municipalities, municipal boroughs, district boards, zilla parishads, taluka development boards, town panchayats, village panchayats, sanitary boards and town area committees were some of the different kinds of local bodies which were constituted under the said laws and the management of their affairs were entrusted subject to the control of the State Government to elected bodies. Each one of them was treated as a body corporate. In so far as the staffing pattern of these bodies was concerned, there were at least three classes of persons working under them. Officers holding high administrative posts such as commissioners of corporations, deputy commissioners of corporations, municipal health officers, municipal educational officers, district development officers and chief executive officers of district boards were usually drawn from the ranks of the provincial or the State Services and they were deputed to the various bodies to discharge functions which were either statutory or non-statutory. Even though they drew their salary and allowances from the local bodies to which they were deputed, they still retained their identity as officers of the State Civil Service and their services were liable to be withdrawn by the State Government at any time it pleased. There was a second class of officers like chief executive officers of town municipalities who were officers belonging to the provincial or State local self-Government Service and who were liable to be transferred from one local body to another. There was a third class of officers and servants of the local bodies who were appointed by them and who were for all intents and purposes 160 the employees of the local bodies by which they were appointed. They could not be transferred from one local body to another. The foregoing shows that in the case of persons borne on the State Civil Service or the Provincial local self-Government Service, the fact that they were for the time being working under a local body and were in receipt of salary and allowances from them did not militate against their status as members of the Service from which they were drawn. That was so because even when they were functioning under local bodies, they were engaged in discharging duties and functions which legitimately belonged to the State Government but which had been transferred to the local bodies with the intention of the decentralizing administrative functions and of fostering democratic ideals amongst the people.  Page 15 of 20 The first question is whether the Panchayat Service constituted under the Panchayats Act is a civil service of the State. The expressions ’civil service’ or ’civil post’ are not formally defined. Entry 70 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution refers to Union Public Services and All-India Services, and Entry 41 of List II of that Schedule refers to State public services. Part XIV of the Constitution deals with services under the Union and the States. In Article 309 of the Constitution, we find reference to persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State. Article 310 of the Constitution distinguishes the defence service from the civil service when it refers to members of a ’defence service or of a civil service’. But all persons who are members of a defence service or of a civil service of the Union or of an all-India service or persons who hold any post connected with defence or any civil post under the Union are treated as persons serving the Union and every person who is a member of the civil service of a State or holds any civil post under a State is treated as a person serving a State. The factors which govern the determination of the question whether a person holds a civil post or is a member of civil service were considered by a Constitution Bench of this Court in State of Assam & Ors. v. Shri Nanak Chandra Dutta(1) and Bachawat, J. speaking for the Bench observed thus: ""There is no formal definition of ""post"" and ""civil post"". The sense in which they are used in the Services Chapter of Part XIV of the Constitution is indicated by their context and setting. A civil post is distinguished in Article 310 from a post connected with defence; it is a post on the civil as distinguished from the defence side of the administration, an employment in a civil capacity under the Union or a State. See marginal note to Article 311 161 In Article 311, a member of a civil service of the Union or an all-India service or a civil service of a State is mentioned separately, and a civil post means a post not connected with defence outside the regular civil services. A post is a service or employment. A person holding a post under a State is a person serving or employed under the State. See the marginal notes to Articles 309, 310 and 311. The heading and the sub heading of Part XIV and Chapter I emphasise the element of service. There is a relationship of master and servant between the State and a person holding a post under it. The existence of this relationship is indicated by the State’s right to select and appoint the holder of the post, its right to suspend and dismiss him, its right to control and manner and method of his doing the work and the payment by it of his wages or remuneration. A relationship of master and servant may be established by the presence of all or some of these indicia in conjunction with other circumstances and it is a question of fact in each case whether there is such a relation between the State and the alleged holder of a post."" According to the above decision, the true test for determination of the question whether a person is holding a civil post or is a member of the civil service is the existence of a relationship of master and servant between the State and the person holding a post under it and that the existence of such relationship is dependent upon the right of the State to select and appoint the holder of the  Page 16 of 20 post. its right to suspend and dismiss him, its right to control the manner and method of his doing the work and the payment by it of his wages and remuneration. It is further held that the relationship of master and servant may be established by the presence of all or some of the factors referred to above in conjunction with other circumstances. Applying these tests, this Court held that a Mauzadar in the Assam Valley who was engaged in the work of collection of land revenue and other Government dues and in the performance or certain other special duties was a person holding a civil post under the State. Following the above decision in Superintendent of Post Offices etc. etc. v. P. K. Rajamma etc. etc. this Court held that persons who were working as extra departmental agents of the Posts and Telegraphs Department were persons holding civil posts. 162 Section 102 of the Panchayats Act before it was amended by the Amending Act read as follows: ""102. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder (a) there shall be a Secretary for every gram panchayat and nagar panchayat who shall be appointed in accordance with the rules; (b) a gram panchayat or as the case may be, nagar panchayat shall have such other servants as may be determined under section 203. Such servants shall be appointed by such Authority and their conditions of service shall be such as may be prescribed :.. "" Section 122 of the Panchayats Act reads: ""122. Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder (1) there shall be a Secretary for every taluka panchayat, (2) the Taluka Development officer who shall be an officer belonging to the State Service and posted under the panchayat, shall be the ex officio Secretary of the panchayat. (3) a taluka panchayat shall have such other officers and Servants as may be determined under section 203. Such officers and servants shall be appointed by such authority and their conditions of service shall be such as may be prescribed. ’ The officers and servants so appointed shall in the discharge of their functions and duties exercise such powers as may be conferred on them by the panchayat, subject to rules, if any, Made in this behalf."" Clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 123 of the Panchayats Act authorises the Taluka Development officer to appoint such class of officers and servants as may be prescribed. Section 142 of the Panchayats Act reads: ""142. Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder (1) there shall be a secretary for every district panchayat; (2) (a) a District Development officer posted under the panchayat, shall be ex-officio secretary of the panchayat; (3) a district panchayat shall have such other officers and servants as may be determined under section 203. Such officers and servants shall be appointed by such authority and 163  Page 17 of 20 their conditions of service shall be such as may be prescribed. The officers and servants so appointed shall in the discharge of their functions and duties exercise such powers as may be conferred on them by the panchayat, subject to rules, if any, made in this behalf."" Clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 143 of the Panchayats Act empowers the District Development officer to appoint such class of officers and servants as may be prescribed. It is significant that sections 102, 122 and 142 of the Panchayats Act provide that the gram panchayat or the nagar panchayat or the taluka panchayat or the district panchayat, as the case may be, shall have such other officers and servants as may be determined under section 203 of the Panchayats Act and such officers and servants shall be appointed by such authority and their conditions of service shall be such as may be prescribed. As mentioned earlier, Section 203 (1) of the Panchayats Act provides that there shall be constituted a Panchayat Service in connection with the affairs of panchayats i.e. gram and nagar panchayat, taluka panchayat and district panchayat for the purpose of bringing about uniform scales of pay and uniform conditions of service of the person employed in the discharge of functions and duties of panchayats. It may be noted that the Panchayat Service contemplated under section 203 of the Panchayats Act is a single service for the whole State and it is not a collection of distinct and separate services of each individual panchayat. That Panchayat Service is a service under the State is again emphasized by section 206 which authorises the State Government to pool together four classes of persons mentioned therein who originally belonged to four different sources and to allocate them to the Panchayat Service and one class of such persons are those who belong to the State Service. Unless the Panchayat Service is held to be a State service, inclusion of officers and servants in the State service will be unconstitutional. Sections 157 and 158 would also be exposed to a similar attack. (Vide State of Mysore v. H. Pappana Gowda & Anr. etc.) It is a well-settled rule of construction that a court ought not to interpret statutory provisions unless compelled by their language in such a manner as would involve their unconstitutionality because the legislature is presumed to enact a law which does not contravene the Constitution. In the instant case, we feel that there is no compelling reason to hold that the Panchayat Service is not a civil service under the State. It is seen that further recruitment of candidates to the Panchayat Service has to be made by the Gujarat Panchayat Service Selection Board constituted by the State Government. Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, 164 as mentioned earlier, also refers to State Public Services suggesting that there can be more than one State Public Service under the State. We have indeed a number of such services under a State e.g, Police Service, educational service, revenue service etc. State Public Services may be constituted or established either by a law made by the State Legislature or by rules made under the provision to Article 309 of the Constitution or even by an executive order made by the State Government in exercise of its powers under Article 162 of the Constitution. The recruitment and conditions of service of the officers and servants of the State Government may also be regulated by statute, rules or executive orders. The administration of a service under a  Page 18 of 20 State involves broadly the following functions: (i) the organisation of the Civil Service and the determination of the remuneration, conditions of service, expenses and allowances of persons serving in it; (ii) the manner of admitting persons to civil service; (iii) exercise of disciplinary control over members of the service and power to transfer, suspend, remove or dismiss them in the public interest as and when occasion to do so arises. In the instant case, the Panchayat Service is constituted by the Panchayats Act and the State Government is empowered to make orders and rules regarding its organisation and management. It is true that section 203 of the Panchayats Act, it is stated that the Panchayat Service shall be distinct from the State Service. Having regard to the broad features of the Panchayat Service, we are of the view that the said declaration appears to have been made only to distinguish the Panchayat Service from other services of the State attached to the several departments which are under the direct control of the State Government. If the members of the Panchayat Service are not to be the members of a Service under the State Government but are to be the officers and servants of the panchayat unit to which they are allotted then sub-sections (2), (2A) and 4(a) of section 203 of the Panchayats Act would to some extent become unworkable as every time there is a transfer of an officer borne on the Panchayat Service there would be a change of master. We do not think that the Legislature intended such a bizarre result. Sub-section (2) of section 203 authorises the division of the Panchayat Service into different classes, cadres and posts. Sub-section (2A) of section 203 provides that the Panchayat Service may consist of district cadres, taluka cadres and local cadres and that a servant belonging to a district cadre may be transferred from a post in any one taluka to a post in another taluka in the district, a servant belonging to a taluka cadre may be transferred from a post in any gram or nagar to a post in any other gram or nagar in the same taluka. Sub-section (4) of section 203 authorises promulgation of rules providing for promotion of servants in the Pan 165 chayat Service to cadres in the State Service. Such promotion is possible only because the State Government is the master of the Panchayat Service. The reason for treating Panchayat Service as a service distinct from State Service appears to be that the law intended that person belonging to the Panchayat Service should be transferable from one post in a panchayat to another post in a panchayat and unless there was an order of promotion, such persons could not be transferred to posts outside the panchayats. Merely because the panchayats are declared to be body corporates, it cannot be said that any of the persons working under them cannot considered as members of a civil service under a State. The panchayats constituted under the Panchayats Act derive their authority from the statute and are under the control of the State Government. They form part of the local self-Government organisation which the State Government is under an obligation to foster under Article 40 of the Constitution. Entry 5 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution specifically refers to local authorities established for the purpose of local self Government or village administration as part of local Government. The local authorities are included in the definition of the expression ’State’ in Article 12 of the Constitution. The panchayats exercise many governmental functions which the State Government can perform. They are  Page 19 of 20 entrusted with the power to levy taxes and to exercise large number of powers which are loosely called as ""police powers"" regulating several aspects of human life. Articles 276 and 277 of the Constitution also take note of the powers of local authorities to levy certain taxes. In addition to the express powers granted to the panchayats, the State Government is also authorised under the Panchayats Act to delegate many of its functions to them and to transfer many of its officers and servants to function under their supervision and control as members of the Panchayat Service. It is manifest from the foregoing that it cannot be said that person working as members of the Panchayat Service are not persons engaged in governmental functions and, therefore, it is not possible to treat them as members of the State Civil Service. We, however, make it clear that it is quite possible that under the statute it may be open to the panchayats to employ servants for the purpose of, administration of the panchayats who may not be members of the Panchayat Service. We are concerned in these cases only with the members of the Panchayat Service constituted under section 203(1) with regard to whose appointment and conditions of service the Government alone has been entrusted with the power to make rules under section 203(3). We are of the view H. that the Panchayat Service constituted under section 203 of the PanchaYats Act has all the characteristics of a Civil Service of the State. This 166 also appears to have been the view of the State Government when it constituted the second Pay Commission (Desai Commission) as can be seen from the Government Resolution constituting the said Commission requiring it to examine the general conditions of service applicable to Government employees other than officers of the all India services but including employees in the Panchayat Service (Vide Resolution No. PDS 1672/1526/P dated November 20, 1972 passed by the Government of Gujarat) and there is no justification for taking a view different from the one taken by the High Court of Gujarat in Shukla’s case (supra) as early as 1967. Several orders and rules issued by the Government of Gujarat under the Panchayats Act since its commencement also support the aforesaid view. At this stage, it is necessary to refer to a decision of this Court in Jalgaon Zilla Parishad v. Duman Govind & Ors on which reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the State Government in support of the contention that the Panchayat Service cannot be considered as a State Civil Service. In that case, the question which arose for consideration was whether kotwals who were holding posts under the Slate Government ceased to be the employees of the Government on the transfer of their services to Zilla Parishads. This Court held that they ceased to be the Government servants as they had been transferred to the services of the Zilla Parishads. That decision turned on the true construction of section 239 of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 which provided for the constitution by the State Government as from the appointed day a District Technical Service (Class III), a District Service (Class III) and a District Service (Class IV) for each Zilla Parishad. We do not have a corresponding provision in the Panchayats Act providing for the constitution of a service for each panchayat but on the other hand, the statutory requirement is that a Panchayat Service should be constituted in respect of all the panchayats i.e. district panchayats, taluka panchayats and gram and nagar panchayats. Such a common service constituted  0 of 20 for the benefit of all panchayats leads to the inevitable conclusion that the State alone can be the master of the members of that Service and not the individual Panchayats. The decision relied on has, therefore, no bearing on the question before us. We, therefore, reject the contention of the State Government that the Panchayat Service is not a civil service under the State. We, however, make it clear that the view taken by us in the present case does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that every employee of a local body who is not a member of the Panchayat Service should be treated as a member of the State 167 Civil Service. It is a question of fact to be decided in each case depending on the circumstances of that case. The second question is a simple one and does not require much elaboration. The provisions contained in section 206 of the Panchayats Act and the provisions in sub sections (2), (2A), (3) and (4) of section 203 clearly establish that the Panchayat Service constituted under section 203 can only be a centralized service and recruitment of candidates to be made under section 210 of the Panchayats Act by the Gujarat Panchayat Service Selection Board can only be to that centralized service. The division of the Panchayat Service into district cadre, taluka cadre and local cadre does not affect the integrity of the Panchayat Service. It continues to be a single service notwithstanding such division. When the Panchayat Service is a State-wide service, it has necessarily to be held that it is a common centralised service In the result, we answer the two points which are set down for decision at this stage as follows: ""1. The Panchayat Service constituted under the Panchayats Act is a civil service of the State of Gujarat; and 2. that under the unamended Act, there was a common centralized Panchayat Service."" The cases shall now be posted before a Bench of three Hon’ble Judges for further hearing on other points as directed by the Court on July 24. 1980. N.V.K","JUDGMENT: CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 359 of 1978. Appeal by special leave from the Judgment and Order dated 28-1-1977 of the Gujarat High Court in Special Civil Application No. 309/1975. WITH WRIT PETITION NOS. 4266-4270 of 1978 (Under Article 32 of the Constitution) V. M. Tarkunde, Niranjan Mehta, P. H. Parekh, C. B. Singh and M.

Shah for the Appellants in CA 359/78 and Respondents 1-2 in Writ  Page 7 of 20 Petitions. Nirajan Mehta, Vimal Dave and Miss Kailash Mehta for the Applicant intervener in Writ Petition. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, J. The State of Gujarat and the Development Commissioner of the State of Gujarat have filed Civil Appeal No. 359 of 1978 under Article 136 of the Constitution against the judgment, dated January 28th, 1977 passed in Special Civil Application No. 309 of 1975 on the file of the High Court of Gujarat. Respondents Nos. 1 to 5 in the above appeal were the petitioners in the aforesaid Special Civil Application. They had filed the 150 said application with the leave of the High Court in a representative capacity for and on behalf of themselves and other officers and servants who were originally in the employment of several municipalities which had been constituted under the Bombay District Municipal Act, 1901 (hereinafter referred to as ’the Municipal Act’) and who were working as the employees under gram panchayats or nagar panchayats which were established in the place of the municipalities referred to above under the provisions of the Gujarat Panchayats Act, 1961 (Gujarat Act No. VI of 1962) (hereinafter referred to as ’the Panchayats Act’) under Article 226 of the Constitution requesting the High Court to issue an appropriate writ, order or direction to the State of Gujarat and others who had been impleaded as respondents therein directing them (i) to pass orders regarding the appointment of the persons for and on whose behalf the said application had been filed in equivalent posts in the Panchayat Service of the State Government, fixation of their seniority and pay scales and allowances in the equivalent posts with retrospective effect and payment to them of the difference in salary and allowances to which they would become entitled on such fixation of salary and allowances payable to them, (ii) to frame rules providing for promotional avenues to them in the Panchayat Service as also in the State Service and (iii) to extend to them the benefits flowing from the pay revisions ordered by the State Government on the basis of the recommendations of the first Pay Commission (Sarela Commission) and the second Pay Commission (Desai Commission) retrospectively. They also prayed for certain incidental reliefs. Writ Petitions Nos. 4266 to 4270 of 1978 were filed by them before this Court under Article 32 of Constitution in a representative capacity with the leave of this Court requesting the Court to declare the Gujarat Panchayats (Amendment) Ordinance, 1978 (hereinafter referred to as ’the Ordinance’) as unconstitutional, void and of no effect and to grant them such reliefs as may be permissible consequent upon such declaration. After the above writ petitions were filed, the Ordinance was repealed and replaced by the Gujarat Panchayats (Third Amendment) Act, 1978 (Gujarat Act No. 28 of 1978) (hereinafter referred to as ’the Amending Act’). Thereafter the petitioners prayed for an amendment of the writ petitions requesting the Court to permit them to question the validity of the Amending Act in so far as it adversely affected them. Their prayer was accordingly granted. The writ petitions are contested by the State Government. 151 For purposes of convenience, respondents Nos. 1 to 5 in Civil Appeal No. 359 of 1978 who are also petitioners in the writ petitions Nos. 4266 to 4270 of 1978 are hereafter referred to as the petitioners.  Page 8 of 20 Before the Panchayats Act was enacted there existed in the State of Gujarat a number of municipalities constituted under the Municipal Act and the petitioners and those whom they represent in these proceedings by virtue of the leave granted to them to prosecute these proceedings in a representative capacity were employees of such municipalities. The Panchayats Act was enacted for the purpose of consolidating and amending the law relating to village panchayats and district local boards in the State of Gujarat with a view to reorganise the administration pertaining to the local Government in furtherance of the object of democratic decentralisation of powers in favour of different classes of panchayats. It provided for the establishment of panchayats of different tiers viz. a gram panchayat for each gram, a nagar panchayat for each nagar, a taluka panchayat for each taluka and a district panchayat for a district. Section 9 of the Panchayats Act empowered the State Government to declare any local area comprising a revenue village or a group of revenue villages or hamlets forming part of a revenue village or such other administrative unit or part thereof to be a nagar, if the population of such local area exceeded 10,000 but did not exceed 20,000 and to be a gram, if the population of such local area did not exceed 10,000 by issuing a notification in the Official Gazette to that effect. Section 307 of the Panchayats Act provided that where any local area was declared to be a gram or nagar under section 9 and, immediately before such declaration, the local area was co-extensive with the limits of a municipal district or a municipal borough or included an area comprising a municipal district or municipal borough as well as any other area, then with effect from the date on which such local area was so declared to be a gram or nagar, the consequences mentioned therein would ensue notwithstanding anything in the relevant municipal law. Two of the consequences which flowed from such a declaration were that the municipality functioning in such a local area or part thereof would cease to exist and all officers and servants in the employ of the municipality immediately before the said date would become officers and servants of the interim panchayat under the Panchayats Act and shall until other provision was made in accordance with the provisions thereof would receive salaries and allowances and be subject to the conditions of service to which they were entitled or subject on such date. Section 308 of the Panchayats Act required the 152 District Development Officer to take steps to hold election for a new gram panchayat or nagar panchayat, as the case may be, within a period not exceeding one year from the date on which the interim panchayat came into existence. Chapter XI in which sections 203 to 211 of the Panchayats Act are included sets out provisions relating to services. Section 203 of the Panchayats Act prior to the promulgation of the Ordinance read as follows: ""203. (1) For the purpose of bringing about uniform scales of pay and uniform conditions of service for persons employed in the discharge of functions and duties of panchayats, there shall be constituted a Panchayat Service in connection with the affairs of panchayats. Such service shall be distinct from the State Service. (2) The Panchayat Service shall consist of such classes, cadres and posts and the initial strength of officers and servants in each such class and cadre  Page 9 of 20 shall be such, as the State Government may by order from time to time determine: Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall prevent a district panchayat from altering, with the previous approval of the State Government, any class, cadre or number of posts so determined by the State Government. (2A) (a) The cadres referred to in sub-section (2) may consist of district cadres, taluka cadres and local cadres. (b) A servant belonging to a district cadre shall be liable to be posted whether by promotion or transfer to any post in any taluka in the district. (c) A servant belonging to a taluka cadre shall be liable to be posted, whether by promotion or transfer to any post in any gram or nagar in the same taluka. (d) A servant belonging to a local cadre shall be liable to be posted whether by promotion or transfer to any post in the same gram or, as the case may be, nagar. (2B) In addition to the posts in the cadre referred to in sub-section (2A), a panchayat may have such other posts of such classes as the State Government may by general or special order determine. Such posts shall be called ""deputation posts"" and shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of section 207. 153 (3) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the State Government may make rules regulating the mode of recruitment either by holding examinations or otherwise and conditions of service of persons appointed to the panchayat service and the powers in respect of appointments, transfers and promotions of officers and servants in the Panchayat Service and disciplinary action against any such officers or servants. (4) Rules made under sub-section (3) shall in particular contain (a) a provision entitling servants of such cadres in the Panchayat Service to promotion to such cadres in the State Service as may be prescribed. (b) a provision specifying the classes of posts recruitment to which shall be made through the District Panchayat Service Selection Committee and the classes of posts, recruitment to which shall be made by the Gujarat Panchayat Service Selection Board, and (c) a provision regarding the percentage of vacancies to be reserved for the members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes in the Panchayat Service. (5) Such rules may provide for inter-district transfer of servants belonging to the panchayat service and the circumstances in which and the conditions subject to which such transfers may be made. Section 205 of the Panchayats Act states that subject to any rules made under section 203, appointments to the Panchayat Service shall be made (i) by direct recruitment, (ii) by promotion and (iii) by transfer of members of the State Service to the Panchayat Service. Section 206 of the Panchayats Act before the Amending Act was passed empowered the State Government by a general or special order to   20 allocate to the Panchayat Service (i) such number of officers and servants out of the staff allotted or transferred to a panchayat under sections 157, 158 and 325 as it may deem fit, (ii) all officers and servants of the municipalities dissolved under section 307, (iii) all officers and servants in the service of district local boards and district school boards immediately before their dissolution under the Panchayats Act and transferred to the panchayats under sections 155 and 326 and (iv) and other officers and servants employed in the State service as may be necessary to enable the panchayats to discharge efficiently their functions and duties 154 under the Panchayats Act. Section 210 of the Panchayats Act provides for the establishment of a Gujarat Panchayat Service Selection Board for the purpose of recruitment of candidates to the several posts in the Panchayat Service. The provisions contained in Chapter XI of the Panchayats Act may be summarised thus: Section 203 of the Panchayats Act provides for the constitution of a Panchayat Service which shall be distinct from the State Service. The State Government is authorised to determine by orders issued from time to time several classes, cadres and posts in the Panchayat Service and the initial strength of the officers and servants in each such class and cadre. The Panchayat Service may consist of district cadres, taluka cadres and local cadres. A servant belonging to a district cadre is liable to be posted either by promotion or transfer to any post in any taluka in the district, a servant belonging to a taluka cadre is liable to be posted similarly to any post in any gram or nagar in the same taluka and a servant belonging to a local cadre may similarly be posted in the same gram or, as the case may be, nagar. The Panchayat Service may also consist of certain posts designated as deputation posts, which may be filled in accordance with the provisions of section 207. The State Government is empowered to make rules regulating the mode of recruitment and conditions of service of appointments, transfers and promotions of officers and servants of appointments, transfers and promotions of officers and servants in the Panchayat Service and disciplinary action against any such officers or servants. Sub-section (4) of section 203 of the Panchayats Act provides that rules may be made under sub-section (3) thereof containing provisions entitling servants of such cadres in the Panchayats Service to promotion to such cadres in the State Service as may be prescribed. We have noticed earlier that under section 206 of the Panchayats Act, it is open to the State Government to allocate to the Panchayat Service such number of officers and servants out of the staff allotted or transferred to a panchayat under sections 157, 158 and 325 as it may deem fit. Section 157 of the Panchayats Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, the. State Government may subject to such conditions as it may think fit to impose, transfer by an order published in the Official Gazette to a district panchayat any such powers, functions and duties relating to any matter as are exercised or performed by the State Government or any officer of Government under any enactment which the State Legislature is competent to enact, or otherwise in the executive power of the State, and appear 155 to relate to matters arising within a district and to be of an administrative character and shall on such transfer, allot to the district panchayat such fund and personnel as   of 20 may be necessary to enable the district panchayat to exercise the power and discharge the functions and duties so transferred. Sub-section (2) of section 157 sets out some of the departments whose powers, functions and duties that may be transferred under section 157 (1). Section 158 of the Panchayats Act provides that any functions and duties relating to any of the matters specified in the Panchayat Functions List performed before the commencement of that section by the State Government through its officers within a gram, nagar, taluka or district shall, subject to such exceptions as the State Government may by order in writing specify, be transferred to the district panchayat together with the funds provided, and the staff employed therefor. By section 325 of the Panchayats Act, the Bombay Village Panchayats Act, 1958 was repealed and all officers and servants in the employ of the old village panchayats immediately before the said date became the officers and servants of the new gram panchayats established under the Panchayts Act. We shall now briefly refer to some of the steps taken under the Panchayats Act after it came into force on June 15, 1962 in the State of Gujarat except in Kutch area and the district of Dangs. On March 4, 1963 by an order made by the State Government, the areas which were within the jurisdiction of the several municipalities constituted under the Municipal Act were declared to be gram or nagar, as the case may be. On April 1, 1963, sections 203 to 205 of the Panchayats Act were brought into operation. On March 26, 1963, the State Government entrusted some of its functions relating to recovery of land revenue etc. to the nagar and gram panchayats with effect from April 15, 1963. On August 1, 1963 by a notification issued under section 149 of the Panchayats Act, the State Government delegated some of its powers under the Land Revenue Code and rules made thereunder to the gram and nagar panchayats. On July 13, 1964, the Gujarat Panchayat Service (Conduct) Rules, 1964 promulgated under section 203 of the Panchayats Act came into force. On July 16, 1964, the Gujarat Service (Discipline & Appeal) Rules, 1964 came into force. On November 11, 1965, the Gujarat Panchayat Service (Absorption, Seniority, Pay & Allowances) Rules were promulgated. On October 16, 1968, the Gujarat Panchayat Service (Transfer of Servants) Rules, 1968 were promulgated. The Gujarat Panchayat Service (Promotion to cadres in State Service) Rules, 1974 were issued on September 16, 1974. 156 The Gujarat Panchayat Service (Pension) Rules, 1976 were issued on January 9, 1976. The State Government passed an order under sub-section (2) of section 203 of the Panchayats Act of January 2, 1967 directing that the Panchayat Service shall consist of district cadre, taluka cadre and local cadre and specified the posts which were to belong to each of such cadres in the Schedule appended to the said order. In Part III of the Schedule to that Order, the posts belonging to the local cadre with which we are concerned in these cases were specified. It is stated that by certain administrative orders the State Government had also undertaken the liability of reimbursing the panchayats, either wholly or in part in respect of the remuneration paid by them to the specified staff even though under section 204 of the Panchayats Act, the expenditure towards pay, allowances etc. of officers and servants in Panchayat Service should be met out of panchayat funds. Although the above mentioned and some other steps were taken by the State Government under the Panchayats Act   of 20 providing for the constitution of the Panchayat Service, the State Government did not make any order regarding the equation of posts of the staff in the local cadre and fixation of their pay scale till 1975 notwithstanding the fact that repeated representations were made by the ex municipal employees and others who were included in the local cadre. The State Government also failed to extend to the staff borne on the local cadre of the Panchayat Service the benefit of revisions of pay scales and other allowances which were made on the basis of the recommendations of the first Pay Commission (Sarela Commission) and of the second Pay Commission (Desai Commission). The State Government also did not make any rules prescribing the promotional avenues for the staff borne on the local cadre of the Panchayat Service. The petitioners, therefore, filed the Special Civil Application No. 309 of 1975 on the file of the High Court of Gujarat out of which the above appeal arises under Article 226 of the Constitution for several reliefs, referred to above. The said application was resisted by the State of Gujarat and the Development Commissioner who had been impleaded as the respondents. The contentions urged by the petitioners before the High Court among others were that the Panchayat Service was as much a service under the State as any other State Civil Service; that the State Government had failed to discharge its statutory duties in relation to the members of the staff included in the local cadre of the Panchayat Service and that the denial of benefits similar to those extended to other members of the State Civil Service on the basis 157 of the reports of the two Pay Commissions to them amounted to hostile discrimination. The principal contention urged on behalf of the State Government was that the members of the Panchayat Service were not Government servants and, therefore, could not claim the reliefs prayed for by them. In support of the above contention, reliance was placed by the State Government on section 203 (1) of the Panchayats Act which stated that the Panchayat Service was distinct from the State Service. It should be mentioned here that the question whether the Panchayat Service constituted under the Panchayats Act was a Civil Service under the State Government or not arose for consideration before the High Court of Gujarat in G. L. Shukla & Anr. v. The State of Gujarat & Ors.(1). That was a case in which some of the employees of the State Government working in the Public Works Department questioned the constitutional validity of a notification issued by the State Government transferring certain, functions of the Public Works Department to the panchayats and transferring some of the officers and servants working in that department to the Panchayat Service. The petitioners therein who had been allotted to the Panchayat Service under that order contended that the notification was violative of Articles 14, 310 and 311 of the Constitution on the ground that by virtue of the impugned notification, they had been removed from the service of the State Government against their will and in violation of their rights under the Constitution. The High Court dismissed the petition holding that they had not ceased to be Government servants by reason of the allocation of their services to the Panchayat Service. Bhagwati, J. (as he then was) observed in the course of the said decision at page 845 thus: ""When an order of allocation is made under sec. 206, the Government servant who is allocated does not cease to be a State servant and become a servant of the  Page 13 of 20 panchayat. There is no termination of his service as a State servant and the only effect of the order of allocation is that whereas, prior to the order of allocation, he was a member of one civil service of the State, namely, the State Service, he is now, after the order of allocation, a member of another civil service of the State, namely, the panchayat service. He is merely transferred from one civil service of the State to another. The Panchayat Service contemplated under the Act is as much a civil service of the State as the State service. The Legislature by enacting 158 the Act provided for the establishment of the Panchayat Organization of the State and for the efficient administration of the Panchayat Organization, particularly in view of the fact that a large part of the service personnel would be drawn from different sources and would, therefore, be heterogeneous in composition with widely differing scales of pay and conditions of service, the Legislature felt that it would be desirable to have a separate civil service of persons employed in the discharge of functions and duties of panchayats with uniform scales of pay and uniform conditions of service and, therefore with that end in view the Legislature provided for constitution of the panchayat service. All the provisions of the Act relating to the panchayat service point unmistakably and inevitably to one and only one conclusion, namely, that the panchayat service is one single service with the State as the master."" Following the decision in Shukla’s case (supra) the High Court held in the case out of which this appeal arises that the petitioners herein who belonged to the local cadre were Government servants and directed the State Government (i) to issue suitable orders, in so far as the members included in the local cadre were concerned regarding the equivalence of posts, fixation of pay scales for such posts, fixation of the petitioners and the persons whom they represent at an appropriate stage in such pay scales and other incidental matters and to give effect to such orders from the date of allocation of the petitioners and others whom they represent to the Panchayat Service, that is to say, from February 11, 1969, (ii) to fix their initial pay scales and allowances and to revise them in accordance with the orders passed by the State Government in the case of other Government employees on the basis of the first Pay Commission (Sarela Commission) and of the second Pay Commission (Desai Commission) with effect from the dates on which similar benefits were extended to other State Civil Services, and (iii) to consider the question of making suitable provisions in the appropriate rules providing for promotion of members of the local cadre who were formerly the employees of the municipalities. Aggrieved by the directions issued by the High Court, the State Government and the Development Commissioner have filed this appeal. During the pendency of the above appeal, as stated above, the Ordinance was issued by the Governor of Gujarat amending some of the provisions of the Panchayats Act and the said Ordinance was replaced by the Amending Act. As the petitioners felt that their interests were adversely affected by the Ordinance and the Amending Act, they filed the writ petitions referred to above. 159 Although several questions arise for consideration in the above appeal, at this stage we propose to deal with  Page 14 of 20 only the following two contentions as per orders passed by the Court on July 24, 1980: ""(1) Whether the Panchayat Service was a Civil Service of the State and (2) whether under the unamended Act, there was a common centralized Panchayat Service?"" It is well-known that in India experiment in administration of local self Government had been going on for well over a century in almost all British Indian provinces and many princely States that were in existence before the commencement of the Constitution. There were laws having local operation under which different kinds of local self-Government bodies were constituted to enable persons living in different local areas to participate in the administration of such local areas in so far as functions that were delegated to them by law. All those laws continued to be in force even after the commencement of the Constitution. Some of them have since been repealed and replaced by new laws. Municipal corporations, city municipalities, town municipalities, municipal boroughs, district boards, zilla parishads, taluka development boards, town panchayats, village panchayats, sanitary boards and town area committees were some of the different kinds of local bodies which were constituted under the said laws and the management of their affairs were entrusted subject to the control of the State Government to elected bodies. Each one of them was treated as a body corporate. In so far as the staffing pattern of these bodies was concerned, there were at least three classes of persons working under them. Officers holding high administrative posts such as commissioners of corporations, deputy commissioners of corporations, municipal health officers, municipal educational officers, district development officers and chief executive officers of district boards were usually drawn from the ranks of the provincial or the State Services and they were deputed to the various bodies to discharge functions which were either statutory or non-statutory. Even though they drew their salary and allowances from the local bodies to which they were deputed, they still retained their identity as officers of the State Civil Service and their services were liable to be withdrawn by the State Government at any time it pleased. There was a second class of officers like chief executive officers of town municipalities who were officers belonging to the provincial or State local self-Government Service and who were liable to be transferred from one local body to another. There was a third class of officers and servants of the local bodies who were appointed by them and who were for all intents and purposes 160 the employees of the local bodies by which they were appointed. They could not be transferred from one local body to another. The foregoing shows that in the case of persons borne on the State Civil Service or the Provincial local self-Government Service, the fact that they were for the time being working under a local body and were in receipt of salary and allowances from them did not militate against their status as members of the Service from which they were drawn. That was so because even when they were functioning under local bodies, they were engaged in discharging duties and functions which legitimately belonged to the State Government but which had been transferred to the local bodies with the intention of the decentralizing administrative functions and of fostering democratic ideals amongst the people.  Page 15 of 20 The first question is whether the Panchayat Service constituted under the Panchayats Act is a civil service of the State. The expressions ’civil service’ or ’civil post’ are not formally defined. Entry 70 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution refers to Union Public Services and All-India Services, and Entry 41 of List II of that Schedule refers to State public services. Part XIV of the Constitution deals with services under the Union and the States. In Article 309 of the Constitution, we find reference to persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State. Article 310 of the Constitution distinguishes the defence service from the civil service when it refers to members of a ’defence service or of a civil service’. But all persons who are members of a defence service or of a civil service of the Union or of an all-India service or persons who hold any post connected with defence or any civil post under the Union are treated as persons serving the Union and every person who is a member of the civil service of a State or holds any civil post under a State is treated as a person serving a State. The factors which govern the determination of the question whether a person holds a civil post or is a member of civil service were considered by a Constitution Bench of this Court in State of Assam & Ors. v. Shri Nanak Chandra Dutta(1) and Bachawat, J. speaking for the Bench observed thus: ""There is no formal definition of ""post"" and ""civil post"". The sense in which they are used in the Services Chapter of Part XIV of the Constitution is indicated by their context and setting. A civil post is distinguished in Article 310 from a post connected with defence; it is a post on the civil as distinguished from the defence side of the administration, an employment in a civil capacity under the Union or a State. See marginal note to Article 311 161 In Article 311, a member of a civil service of the Union or an all-India service or a civil service of a State is mentioned separately, and a civil post means a post not connected with defence outside the regular civil services. A post is a service or employment. A person holding a post under a State is a person serving or employed under the State. See the marginal notes to Articles 309, 310 and 311. The heading and the sub heading of Part XIV and Chapter I emphasise the element of service. There is a relationship of master and servant between the State and a person holding a post under it. The existence of this relationship is indicated by the State’s right to select and appoint the holder of the post, its right to suspend and dismiss him, its right to control and manner and method of his doing the work and the payment by it of his wages or remuneration. A relationship of master and servant may be established by the presence of all or some of these indicia in conjunction with other circumstances and it is a question of fact in each case whether there is such a relation between the State and the alleged holder of a post."" According to the above decision, the true test for determination of the question whether a person is holding a civil post or is a member of the civil service is the existence of a relationship of master and servant between the State and the person holding a post under it and that the existence of such relationship is dependent upon the right of the State to select and appoint the holder of the  Page 16 of 20 post. its right to suspend and dismiss him, its right to control the manner and method of his doing the work and the payment by it of his wages and remuneration. It is further held that the relationship of master and servant may be established by the presence of all or some of the factors referred to above in conjunction with other circumstances. Applying these tests, this Court held that a Mauzadar in the Assam Valley who was engaged in the work of collection of land revenue and other Government dues and in the performance or certain other special duties was a person holding a civil post under the State. Following the above decision in Superintendent of Post Offices etc. etc. v. P. K. Rajamma etc. etc. this Court held that persons who were working as extra departmental agents of the Posts and Telegraphs Department were persons holding civil posts. 162 Section 102 of the Panchayats Act before it was amended by the Amending Act read as follows: ""102. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder (a) there shall be a Secretary for every gram panchayat and nagar panchayat who shall be appointed in accordance with the rules; (b) a gram panchayat or as the case may be, nagar panchayat shall have such other servants as may be determined under section 203. Such servants shall be appointed by such Authority and their conditions of service shall be such as may be prescribed :.. "" Section 122 of the Panchayats Act reads: ""122. Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder (1) there shall be a Secretary for every taluka panchayat, (2) the Taluka Development officer who shall be an officer belonging to the State Service and posted under the panchayat, shall be the ex officio Secretary of the panchayat. (3) a taluka panchayat shall have such other officers and Servants as may be determined under section 203. Such officers and servants shall be appointed by such authority and their conditions of service shall be such as may be prescribed. ’ The officers and servants so appointed shall in the discharge of their functions and duties exercise such powers as may be conferred on them by the panchayat, subject to rules, if any, Made in this behalf."" Clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 123 of the Panchayats Act authorises the Taluka Development officer to appoint such class of officers and servants as may be prescribed. Section 142 of the Panchayats Act reads: ""142. Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder (1) there shall be a secretary for every district panchayat; (2) (a) a District Development officer posted under the panchayat, shall be ex-officio secretary of the panchayat; (3) a district panchayat shall have such other officers and servants as may be determined under section 203. Such officers and servants shall be appointed by such authority and 163  Page 17 of 20 their conditions of service shall be such as may be prescribed. The officers and servants so appointed shall in the discharge of their functions and duties exercise such powers as may be conferred on them by the panchayat, subject to rules, if any, made in this behalf."" Clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 143 of the Panchayats Act empowers the District Development officer to appoint such class of officers and servants as may be prescribed. It is significant that sections 102, 122 and 142 of the Panchayats Act provide that the gram panchayat or the nagar panchayat or the taluka panchayat or the district panchayat, as the case may be, shall have such other officers and servants as may be determined under section 203 of the Panchayats Act and such officers and servants shall be appointed by such authority and their conditions of service shall be such as may be prescribed. As mentioned earlier, Section 203 (1) of the Panchayats Act provides that there shall be constituted a Panchayat Service in connection with the affairs of panchayats i.e. gram and nagar panchayat, taluka panchayat and district panchayat for the purpose of bringing about uniform scales of pay and uniform conditions of service of the person employed in the discharge of functions and duties of panchayats. It may be noted that the Panchayat Service contemplated under section 203 of the Panchayats Act is a single service for the whole State and it is not a collection of distinct and separate services of each individual panchayat. That Panchayat Service is a service under the State is again emphasized by section 206 which authorises the State Government to pool together four classes of persons mentioned therein who originally belonged to four different sources and to allocate them to the Panchayat Service and one class of such persons are those who belong to the State Service. Unless the Panchayat Service is held to be a State service, inclusion of officers and servants in the State service will be unconstitutional. Sections 157 and 158 would also be exposed to a similar attack. (Vide State of Mysore v. H. Pappana Gowda & Anr. etc.) It is a well-settled rule of construction that a court ought not to interpret statutory provisions unless compelled by their language in such a manner as would involve their unconstitutionality because the legislature is presumed to enact a law which does not contravene the Constitution. In the instant case, we feel that there is no compelling reason to hold that the Panchayat Service is not a civil service under the State. It is seen that further recruitment of candidates to the Panchayat Service has to be made by the Gujarat Panchayat Service Selection Board constituted by the State Government. Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, 164 as mentioned earlier, also refers to State Public Services suggesting that there can be more than one State Public Service under the State. We have indeed a number of such services under a State e.g, Police Service, educational service, revenue service etc. State Public Services may be constituted or established either by a law made by the State Legislature or by rules made under the provision to Article 309 of the Constitution or even by an executive order made by the State Government in exercise of its powers under Article 162 of the Constitution. The recruitment and conditions of service of the officers and servants of the State Government may also be regulated by statute, rules or executive orders. The administration of a service under a  Page 18 of 20 State involves broadly the following functions: (i) the organisation of the Civil Service and the determination of the remuneration, conditions of service, expenses and allowances of persons serving in it; (ii) the manner of admitting persons to civil service; (iii) exercise of disciplinary control over members of the service and power to transfer, suspend, remove or dismiss them in the public interest as and when occasion to do so arises. In the instant case, the Panchayat Service is constituted by the Panchayats Act and the State Government is empowered to make orders and rules regarding its organisation and management. It is true that section 203 of the Panchayats Act, it is stated that the Panchayat Service shall be distinct from the State Service. Having regard to the broad features of the Panchayat Service, we are of the view that the said declaration appears to have been made only to distinguish the Panchayat Service from other services of the State attached to the several departments which are under the direct control of the State Government. If the members of the Panchayat Service are not to be the members of a Service under the State Government but are to be the officers and servants of the panchayat unit to which they are allotted then sub-sections (2), (2A) and 4(a) of section 203 of the Panchayats Act would to some extent become unworkable as every time there is a transfer of an officer borne on the Panchayat Service there would be a change of master. We do not think that the Legislature intended such a bizarre result. Sub-section (2) of section 203 authorises the division of the Panchayat Service into different classes, cadres and posts. Sub-section (2A) of section 203 provides that the Panchayat Service may consist of district cadres, taluka cadres and local cadres and that a servant belonging to a district cadre may be transferred from a post in any one taluka to a post in another taluka in the district, a servant belonging to a taluka cadre may be transferred from a post in any gram or nagar to a post in any other gram or nagar in the same taluka. Sub-section (4) of section 203 authorises promulgation of rules providing for promotion of servants in the Pan 165 chayat Service to cadres in the State Service. Such promotion is possible only because the State Government is the master of the Panchayat Service. The reason for treating Panchayat Service as a service distinct from State Service appears to be that the law intended that person belonging to the Panchayat Service should be transferable from one post in a panchayat to another post in a panchayat and unless there was an order of promotion, such persons could not be transferred to posts outside the panchayats. Merely because the panchayats are declared to be body corporates, it cannot be said that any of the persons working under them cannot considered as members of a civil service under a State. The panchayats constituted under the Panchayats Act derive their authority from the statute and are under the control of the State Government. They form part of the local self-Government organisation which the State Government is under an obligation to foster under Article 40 of the Constitution. Entry 5 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution specifically refers to local authorities established for the purpose of local self Government or village administration as part of local Government. The local authorities are included in the definition of the expression ’State’ in Article 12 of the Constitution. The panchayats exercise many governmental functions which the State Government can perform. They are  Page 19 of 20 entrusted with the power to levy taxes and to exercise large number of powers which are loosely called as ""police powers"" regulating several aspects of human life. Articles 276 and 277 of the Constitution also take note of the powers of local authorities to levy certain taxes. In addition to the express powers granted to the panchayats, the State Government is also authorised under the Panchayats Act to delegate many of its functions to them and to transfer many of its officers and servants to function under their supervision and control as members of the Panchayat Service. It is manifest from the foregoing that it cannot be said that person working as members of the Panchayat Service are not persons engaged in governmental functions and, therefore, it is not possible to treat them as members of the State Civil Service. We, however, make it clear that it is quite possible that under the statute it may be open to the panchayats to employ servants for the purpose of, administration of the panchayats who may not be members of the Panchayat Service. We are concerned in these cases only with the members of the Panchayat Service constituted under section 203(1) with regard to whose appointment and conditions of service the Government alone has been entrusted with the power to make rules under section 203(3). We are of the view H. that the Panchayat Service constituted under section 203 of the PanchaYats Act has all the characteristics of a Civil Service of the State. This 166 also appears to have been the view of the State Government when it constituted the second Pay Commission (Desai Commission) as can be seen from the Government Resolution constituting the said Commission requiring it to examine the general conditions of service applicable to Government employees other than officers of the all India services but including employees in the Panchayat Service (Vide Resolution No. PDS 1672/1526/P dated November 20, 1972 passed by the Government of Gujarat) and there is no justification for taking a view different from the one taken by the High Court of Gujarat in Shukla’s case (supra) as early as 1967. Several orders and rules issued by the Government of Gujarat under the Panchayats Act since its commencement also support the aforesaid view. At this stage, it is necessary to refer to a decision of this Court in Jalgaon Zilla Parishad v. Duman Govind & Ors on which reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the State Government in support of the contention that the Panchayat Service cannot be considered as a State Civil Service. In that case, the question which arose for consideration was whether kotwals who were holding posts under the Slate Government ceased to be the employees of the Government on the transfer of their services to Zilla Parishads. This Court held that they ceased to be the Government servants as they had been transferred to the services of the Zilla Parishads. That decision turned on the true construction of section 239 of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 which provided for the constitution by the State Government as from the appointed day a District Technical Service (Class III), a District Service (Class III) and a District Service (Class IV) for each Zilla Parishad. We do not have a corresponding provision in the Panchayats Act providing for the constitution of a service for each panchayat but on the other hand, the statutory requirement is that a Panchayat Service should be constituted in respect of all the panchayats i.e. district panchayats, taluka panchayats and gram and nagar panchayats. Such a common service constituted  0 of 20 for the benefit of all panchayats leads to the inevitable conclusion that the State alone can be the master of the members of that Service and not the individual Panchayats. The decision relied on has, therefore, no bearing on the question before us. We, therefore, reject the contention of the State Government that the Panchayat Service is not a civil service under the State. We, however, make it clear that the view taken by us in the present case does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that every employee of a local body who is not a member of the Panchayat Service should be treated as a member of the State 167 Civil Service. It is a question of fact to be decided in each case depending on the circumstances of that case. The second question is a simple one and does not require much elaboration. The provisions contained in section 206 of the Panchayats Act and the provisions in sub sections (2), (2A), (3) and (4) of section 203 clearly establish that the Panchayat Service constituted under section 203 can only be a centralized service and recruitment of candidates to be made under section 210 of the Panchayats Act by the Gujarat Panchayat Service Selection Board can only be to that centralized service. The division of the Panchayat Service into district cadre, taluka cadre and local cadre does not affect the integrity of the Panchayat Service. It continues to be a single service notwithstanding such division. When the Panchayat Service is a State-wide service, it has necessarily to be held that it is a common centralised service In the result, we answer the two points which are set down for decision at this stage as follows: ""1. The Panchayat Service constituted under the Panchayats Act is a civil service of the State of Gujarat; and 2. that under the unamended Act, there was a common centralized Panchayat Service."" The cases shall now be posted before a Bench of three Hon’ble Judges for further hearing on other points as directed by the Court on July 24. 1980. N.V.K"

There is no substance in this group of writ petitions filed under Art. 32 of the Constitution whereby the petitioners, who carry on business, inter alia, of the wholesale vend of beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor at various places in the State of U.P. on the strength of licences granted to them in Form FL-2 under the U.P. Excise Act, 1910, have challenged the constitutional validity of ss. 1(2), 3 and (5) of U.P. Excise (Amendment) ordinance No. 4 of 1979 as also the constitutional validity of ss. 1(2), 3 and 5 of U.P. Excise (Amendment) Act No. 13 of 1979 (which replaced the said ordinance No. 4 of 1979) as being violative of their fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution; the petitioners have also sought a declaration that s. 30(2), proviso to cl. (c) of s. 41 and Explanations I and II to cl. (c) of s. 41 of the U.P. Excise Act 1910 as amended by ss. 3 and 5 of the said ordinance No. 4 of 1979 as well as by ss. 3 and 5 of the said Act No. 13 of 1979 and the provisions of sub-s. (2) of s. 1 of the said ordinance (No. 4 of 1979) as well as of the said Act (No. 13 of 1979) are ultra vires the Constitution and have prayed for the issuance of an appropriate writ, order or direction restraining the respondents (the State of U.P., the Excise Commissioner and other officers) either directly or through their agents, servants or otherwise from giving effect to the amended provision. 759 It may be stated that the aforesaid challenge to the U.P. Ordinance No. 4 of 1979, the U.P. Act No. 13 of 1979 and the concerned amended provisions of the U.P. Excise Act, 1910 has been made solely with a view to avoid the payment of the ""assessed fee"" which the respondents are seeking to recover from the petitioners in addition to the ""fixed fee"" (auction money) as and by way of consideration for the grant of licences in Form FL-2 for the wholesale vend of beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor. However, as it became clear during the hearing that even without the amendments affected in the U.P. Excise Act, 1910 (being the Principal Act) by the said ordinance No. 4 of 1979 and by the said Act No. 13 of 1979 the ""assessed fee"" in addition to the ""fixed fee"" (auction money) could be and was being recovered under the Principal Act of 1910 as amended by the U.P, Amending (Reenactment and Validation) Act 5 of 1976 and the Rules framed thereunder, the aforesaid challenge was given up and no arguments in support thereof were at all advanced by any of the counsel for the petitioners and the contentions centered round the question whether such ""assessed fee"" in addition to the ""fixed fee"" (auction money) could be levied  Page 5 of 11 and recovered under the Principal Act of 1910 as amended by the Act 5 of 1976. It was not disputed before us that the grant of exclusive privilege of manufacture, supply or sale by wholesale or by retail of liquor was always governed by the provisions of the Principal Act of 1910 and the Rules framed thereunder and that licences for wholesale vend of beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor were granted in Form FL-2 which contained the terms and conditions on which sales by wholesale of the said commodities could be effected by the grantees thereof. It appears that prior to April 1976 these FL-2 licences were not settled under any auction system but were renewable from year to year and the licence fee was based on the quantity of beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor actually sold from the concerned shop and was assessed and charged at the rate of Rs. 5 per quart bottle on spirits and 60 p. per quart bottle on beers. But from April 1976 auction system was introduced whereunder FL-2 licences were auctioned under the provisions of paragraph 373 of the U.P. excise Manual Vol. I and ""fixed free"". being the highest bid (auction money) accepted at such auction came to be charged for the grant of FL-2 licences and this system was introduced on the strength of the amendments that were made in the Principal Act of 1910 by the Amending (Re-enactment and 760 Validation) Act 5 of 1976. Three or four amendments made by Act 5 of 1976 are material and we shall refer to these presently: A new s. 24A dealing with the grant of exclusive or other privilege in respect of foreign liquor was introduced in the Principal Act, which reads as under: ""24-A. Grant of exclusive or other privilege in respect of foreign liquor. (1) Subject to the provisions of Section 31, the Excise Commissioner may grant to any person a licence or licences for the exclusive or other privilege: (a) of manufacturing or of supply by wholesale, or of both; or (b) of manufacturing or of supplying by wholesale, or of both and selling by retail; or (c) of selling by wholesale (to wholesale or retail vendors); or (d) of selling by retail at shops (for consumption ’off’ the premises); any foreign liquor in any locality. (2) The grant of licence or licences under clause (d) of sub-section (1) in relation to any locality shall be without prejudice to the grant of licences for the retail sale of foreign liquor in the same locality in hotels and restaurants for consumption in their premises. (3) Where more licences than one are proposed to be granted under clause (d) of sub-section (1) in relation to any locality for the same period, advance intimation of the proposal shall be given to the prospective applicants for every such licence. (4) The provisions of Section 25, and proviso to Section 39 shall apply in relation to grant of a licence for an exclusive or other privilege under this section as they apply in respect of the grant of a licence for an exclusive privilege under Section 24,"" 761 Section 24-B which was also introduced by Act 5 of 1976 in the Principal Act reads thus:  Page 6 of 11 ""24-B. Removal of doubts-For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared (a) that the State Government has an exclusive right or privilege of manufacture and sale of country liquor and foreign liquor; (b) that the amount described as licence fee in clause (c) of Section 41 is in its essence the rental or consideration for the grant of such right or privilege by the State Government; (c) that the Excise Commissioner as the head of the Excise Department of the State shall be deemed, while determining or realising such fee, to act for and on behalf of the State Government."" By the same Act section 30 of the Principal Act was amended and the amended s. 30 read thus: ""30. (1) Instead of or in addition to any duty leviable under the Chapter the State Government or on its behalf the Excise Commissioner may accept payment of a sum in consideration of the grant of licence for any exclusive or other privilege under section 24 or Section 24-A. (2) The sum payable under sub-section (1) may be determined either by auction or by calling tenders or otherwise."" Section 41 of the Principal Act which confers power on the Excise Commissioner to make Rules subject to the previous sanction of the State Government touching the matters or topics specified therein was amended by Act 5 of 1976 by substituting cl. (c) thereby conferring power on the Excise Commissioner to frame Rules on the substituted matter or topic and the amended cl. (c) runs thus: ""(C) Prescribing the scale of fees or manner of fixing the fees payable for any licence, permit or pass including 762 any consideration for the grant of any exclusive or other privilege granted under Section 24 or Section 24-A or for storing of any intoxicant."" In exercise of the power so conferred upon him under the amended cl. (c) of s. 41, the Excise Commissioner with the previous sanction of the State Government framed Rules called the U.P. Excise (Wholesale and Retail Vend of Foreign Liquor) (2nd Amendment) Rules, 1976 by issuing the Notification No. 27/Licence-3 dated 14th April, 1976, which were brought into force with effect from the date of publication in the Gazette, namely, 14th April, 1976, by this Notification the existing Rules 639, 641 and 642 as appearing in Excise Manual Vol. I (1962 End.) were amended; Rule 639(2) as amended provides that ""licences in form FL-2 shall be settled by public auction"" while Rule 641 as amended provides that ""the fee for a licence in Form FL-2 shall be the amount of money accepted at the auction of the licence as ’fixed fee’ together with an ’assessed fee’ charged on the basis of the scales of surcharge fee prescribed in the next paragraph following"" and Rule 642 as amended runs thus: ""642. The scales of licence fee applicable to whole-scale licences for the vend of foreign liquor shall be as follows: (i) For a licence in Form FL.1...... (ii) For a licence in Form FL-2-The fixed fee obtained for the licence at the auction in addition to the assessed fees according to the following scales: (a) Spirits, Rs. 5.00 per  Page 7 of 11 wines, liquors reputed quart etc. of all bottle on sale kinds. to licensed vendors. (b) Beer, Stout and Rs. 0.60 per other fermented reputed quart liquors. bottle on sale to licensed vendors. Note: The fixed fee in respect of licence FL-2: one fourth of the licence fee as obtained in the auction 763 shall be payable in advance immediately on the acceptance of the bid and the balance by such instalments as may be specified in the licence to be granted."" By the very notification dated 14th of April, 1976 the Excise Commissioner added one more condition in the form of a proviso to the terms and conditions of FL-2 Licence and the said addition made after condition No. 1 (c), runs thus: ""Provided that the assessment fee on the sales made on the licence in the prescribed manner at such scales of surcharge fee as may be prescribed by the Government and announced at the time of the auction, shall also be payable by the licencee."" Obviously relying upon the aforesaid amendments made in the Principal Act of 1910, by Act 5 of 1976 (some of which were given retrospective effect from the date of the commencement of the Principal Act and others from 16th August 1972) and the said amended Rules 639, 641 and 642 and the insertion of the new condition in the FL-2 Licence (all of which came into force from 14th April, 1976), the respondents introduced the auction system for the grant of licences in Form FL-2 for wholesale vend of beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor and started levying and recovering the ""assessed fee"" in addition to the ""fixed fee"" (auction money) from the grantees of the licences. Question raised is whether such levy and recovery are legal and valid ? Before we deal with the question it will be desirable to set out the facts giving rise to it that lie in a narrow compass and it will suffice if the facts obtaining in Writ Petition No. 528 of 1979, being typically representative of the group, are stated. The petitioners in that petition are liquor dealers and carry on business inter alia of wholesale vend of beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor and for that purpose have wholesale depots in various districts in the State of U.P. For the financial years 1976-77 and 1977-78 they acquired by auction bids wholesale vending rights in respect of Indian Made Foreign Liquor at Agra, Meerut, Varanasi, Kanpur, Bareilly and Dehradun; for the financial year 1978-79 they similarly acquired wholesale vending rights in Indian Made Foreign Liquor at Agra, Meerut and Varanasi and for the financial year 1979-80 they acquired by auction similar rights at Agra, Meerut, Ghaziabad 764 and Pilibhit. In other words being the highest bidder at these places for these years licences for the wholesale vend of Indian Made Foreign Liquor in Form FL-2 were granted to them. At the time of acceptance of their bids at these auctions the petitioners deposited the entire auction money called the ""fixed fee"" in respect of each of the said years with the respondents. The petitioners’ case is that thereafter the respondents are seeking to levy and recover  Page 8 of 11 from them the ""assessed fee"" at the rate of Rs. 5 per quart bottle on spirits and 60 p. per quart bottle on beers actually sold during each of the financial years by their concerned shops or depots in addition the ""fixed fee"". Such levy and recovery of the ""assessed fee"" by the respondents is challenged on two or three grounds indicated hereunder. In the first place Counsel for the petitioners have contended that under s. 30(2) of the Principal Act of 1910 prior to its amendment by U.P. Ordinance No. 4 of 1979 and U.P. Act 13 of 1979 it was open to the respondents to adopt either one or the other method of granting FL-2 licences and determine the licence fee payable by the grantee accordingly, that is to say the respondents could grant the licence ""either by auction or by calling tenders"" and once a particular mode was adopted it was incumbent upon them to apply the same for the purpose of determining the sum payable by the grantee; in other words the contention has been that it was not open to them to adopt a combination of two or more methods and claim ""assessed fee"" in addition to ""fixed fee"" and therefore the instant attempt on the part of the respondents to levy and recover the ""assessed fee"" in addition to ""fixed fee"" would be illegal and without authority of law. According to the petitioners a combination of two or more methods became available to the respondents only under sec. 30(2) as amended by U.P. ordinance No. 4 of 1979 and by U.P. Act 13 of 1979. Secondly, the petitioners have averred that at the time of the said auctions held for each of the said financial years the bidders were not informed that any ""assessed fee"" had been fixed by the State Government which would be payable by the successful bidder and therefore the persons who gave their bids including the petitioners whose highest bids were accepted were led to believe that no fee over and above the auction money would be charged and that the successful bidder would be granted FL-2 licence merely on payment of the auction money. Counsel for the petitioners have therefore contended that the respondents’ attempt to levy and recover the ""assessed fee"" over 765 and above the ""fixed fee"" (auction money) is unwarranted and illegal in as much as the respondents cannot enhance the petitioners’ contractual liability which was limited to the payment of the auction money. Yet another contention raised by Counsel for the petitioners has been that as per the newly inserted condition in FL-2 licence the ""assessed fee"" was required to be ""prescribed by Government and announced at the time of auction"" but in the instant case such ""assessed fee"" has been prescribed by the Excise Commissioner and not by the State Government and was not announced at the time of the auction and for this reason also the same would not be recoverable. As will be shown presently none of these contentions has any merit and each one is liable to be rejected. As regards the first contention a plain reading of s. 30(2) prior to its amendment by U.P. Ordinance No. 4 of 1979 and by U.P. Act No. 13 of 1979 will show that there is no substance in it. The said provision ran thus: ""2. The sum payable under sub-sec. (1) may by determined either by auction or by calling tenders or otherwise."" In other words, the consideration for the grant of FL-2 licence could be determined either by auction or by calling tenders or otherwise. The phrase ""or otherwise"" was sufficiently wide and conferred on its plain grammatical construction power on the State Government or the Excise  Page 9 of 11 Commissioner to grant the licence either by auction or by tenders or partly by auction and partly by tenders or even by adopting yet other methods than by auction or by inviting tenders. In other words, the phrase ""or otherwise"" enabled the State Government or the Excise Commissioner to adopt a combination of one or more methods for granting the FL-2 licence and determine the licence fee accordingly. Having regard to the phrase ""or otherwise"" occurring in the provision it is impossible to accept the contention that only one method to the exclusion of the others could be adopted by the respondents for granting the licence or that one type of fee appropriate to that method could alone be charged. It is true that sub-sec. (2) of s. 30 as amended by U.P. Ordinance No. 4 of 1979 or by U.P. Act No. 13 of 1979 runs thus: ""2. The sum payable under sub-sec. (1) may either be fixed by auction or inviting tenders or otherwise or be assessed on the basis of the sales made or quota lifted 766 under the licence or partly fixed and partly assessed in the aforesaid manner."" But in our view it is manifestly clear that the aforesaid amended provision is clarificatory of the legal position which obtained under sec. 30(2) that was operative prior to the said amendment. In this view of the matter the first contention has to be rejected. The second contention has been that since at the time of holding the concerned auctions the bidders were not informed that any ""assessed fee"" had been prescribed by the State Government which would be payable by the successful bidder and since bids were offered on the representation that the successful bidder would be granted FL-2 licence merely on payment of the ""fixed fee"" (auction money) the respondents’ attempt to levy and recover the ""assessed fee"" over and above the ""fixed fee"" would be unwarranted and illegal because the respondents cannot enhance the contractual liability of the successful bidder which was limited to payment of the auction money. There are two answers to this contention. In the first place it was not disputed before us that to the knowledge of all the bidders these auctions for the grant of FL-2 licences were held under the provisions of the Principal Act of 1910 as amended by Act 5 of 1976 and the Rules framed thereunder which were then in force. We have already referred to the provisions of the amended Rules 639(2), 641 and 642 which were published in the Gazette and brought into force with effect from 14th of April, 1976 and admittedly all auctions for the financial year 1976-77 were held subsequent to that date. Under the amended Rule 641 it was clearly provided that the fee for the FL-2 licence shall be the amount of money accepted at the auction of the licence as ""fixed fee"" together with the ""assessed fee"" charged on the basis of the scales of Surcharge fee prescribed in the next following Rule and the amended Rule 642 prescribed the scales at which the ""assessed fee"" would be so charged. In other words, the bidders who gave their bids must be deemed to have knowledge of the provisions of the aforesaid Rules subject to which the auctions were held and therefore it is difficult to accept the contention that the bidders including the successful bidder whose highest bid was accepted offered their bids believing that only ""fixed fee"" would be charged. Secondly, the averment of the petitioners that at the time of these auctions the bidders were not informed that any ""assessed fee"" had been fixed or prescribed which would be   11 payable by the successful bidder is not quite correct. It has been admitted by the petitioners that at the time of these 767 auctions the new condition that was inserted by the Excise Commissioner in the FL-2 licence by his Notification dated 14th April, 1976 was read out and this newly inserted condition runs thus: ""Provided that the assessment fee on the sales made on the licence in the prescribed manner at such scales of surcharge fee as may be prescribed by the Government and announced at the time of the auction, shall also be payable by licensee"". If admittedly the aforesaid condition inserted in FL-2 licence was read out at the time of the auction then it is clear that the fact that ""assessed fee"" on the sales made on the licence was also payable by the licensee was announced at the time of the auction. The only grievance made by the petitioners has been that the prescribed scales of surcharge fee (under Rule 642) were not announced but that is neither here nor there, for, if once it was announced at the time of the auction that ""assessed fee"" on sales effected on the licence at the prescribed scales shall also be payable by the licensee then obviously the bidders were put on enquiry to find out what scales of surcharge fee had been prescribed under the relevant Rule. In other words the bidders present at these auctions had full knowledge that ""assessed fee"" at prescribed rates will also be charged and it was with full knowledge of this position that they gave their bids. If that be so, there is no question of the respondents’ attempting to enhance the contractual liability of the successful bidder. It will be interesting to mention in this context that the respondents have stated in their counter affidavit that not only did the bidders know that ""assessed fee"" would be charged over and above the ""fixed fee"" (auction money) but many of the successful bidders to whom FL-2 licences were granted have actually passed on the ""assessed fee"" at the prescribed rates to and recovered the same from the retailers to whom they have effected sales of beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor. At least in the case of those petitioners before us who have done so the aforesaid plea put forward on their behalf cannot be regarded as honest. The second contention therefore fails and is rejected. The last contention is merely required to be stated to be rejected. In support of that contention reliance was placed on the newly inserted condition in FL-2 licence which states that the assessed fee ""at such scales of surcharge fee as may be prescribed by the Government"" shall also be payable by the licensee while 768 actually the scales of surcharge fee have been prescribed by the Excise Commissioner by framing the amended Rule 642 in exercise of the powers conferred upon him by cl. (c) of 41 of the Principal Act. Counsel urged that scales of surcharge fee ought to have been prescribed by the Government. In this connection we might refer to sec. 24B(c) which expressly declares that ""the Excise Commissioner as the head of the Excise Department of the State shall be deemed, while determining or realising such fee, to act for and on behalf of the State Government"". It is thus clear that the Excise Commissioner has been statutorily declared to be the agent of the State Government and ""while determining such fee"" by framing the amended Rule 642 he acted for and on behalf of the State Government. In other words, scales of ""assessed   of 11 fee"" under Rule 642 must be deemed to have been prescribed by the State Government. As regards the alleged non announcement at the time of the auctions we have already dealt with that aspect of the matter while dealing with and disposing of the second contention. No other point was raised. It is therefore clear that the levy and recovery of the ""assessed fee"" over and above the ""fixed fee"" by the respondents for granting FL-2 licences to all the petitioners would be legal and valid under the U.P. Excise Principal Act of 1910 as amended by Act 5 of 1976 and the amended Rules framed there under and all the petitions are liable to be dismissed. We accordingly dismiss all the writ petitions with costs and quantify the costs payable by each of the petitioners separately at Rs. 5000. S.R. Petitions dismissed. 76","JUDGMENT:  Page 4 of 11 ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Writ Petition Nos. 528-529, 1645, 288,293, 362,363, 374, 388, 404-406, 510, 512-14, 644 46, 647, 663-65, 707, 710, 720 to 722, 745,793,1037 of 1979,341-43,344-47, 5257,519,5293, 3531-35, 4322 of 1980, 4824, 4825, 5246, 3236, 2963,3472-74,3415-17, 3420, 1363-65, 1327-28, 1337-41, 4101-2, 5326,4949-50 of 1981 and 311 of 1982.

By the same Act section 30 of the Principal Act was amended and the amended s. 30 read thus: ""30. (1) Instead of or in addition to any duty leviable under the Chapter the State Government or on its behalf the Excise Commissioner may accept payment of a sum in consideration of the grant of licence for any exclusive or other privilege under section 24 or Section 24-A. (2) The sum payable under sub-section (1) may be determined either by auction or by calling tenders or otherwise."" Section 41 of the Principal Act which confers power on the Excise Commissioner to make Rules subject to the previous sanction of the State Government touching the matters or topics specified therein was amended by Act 5 of 1976 by substituting cl. (c) thereby conferring power on the Excise Commissioner to frame Rules on the substituted matter or topic and the amended cl. (c) runs thus: ""(C) Prescribing the scale of fees or manner of fixing the fees payable for any licence, permit or pass including 762 any consideration for the grant of any exclusive or other privilege granted under Section 24 or Section 24-A or for storing of any intoxicant."" In exercise of the power so conferred upon him under the amended cl. (c) of s. 41, the Excise Commissioner with the previous sanction of the State Government framed Rules called the U.P. Excise (Wholesale and Retail Vend of Foreign Liquor) (2nd Amendment) Rules, 1976 by issuing the Notification No. 27/Licence-3 dated 14th April, 1976, which were brought into force with effect from the date of publication in the Gazette, namely, 14th April, 1976, by this Notification the existing Rules 639, 641 and 642 as appearing in Excise Manual Vol. I (1962 End.) were amended; Rule 639(2) as amended provides that ""licences in form FL-2 shall be settled by public auction"" while Rule 641 as amended provides that ""the fee for a licence in Form FL-2 shall be the amount of money accepted at the auction of the licence as ’fixed fee’ together with an ’assessed fee’ charged on the basis of the scales of surcharge fee prescribed in the next paragraph following"" and Rule 642 as amended runs thus: ""642. The scales of licence fee applicable to whole-scale licences for the vend of foreign liquor shall be as follows: (i) For a licence in Form FL.1...... (ii) For a licence in Form FL-2-The fixed fee obtained for the licence at the auction in addition to the assessed fees according to the following scales: (a) Spirits, Rs. 5.00 per  Page 7 of 11 wines, liquors reputed quart etc. of all bottle on sale kinds. to licensed vendors. (b) Beer, Stout and Rs. 0.60 per other fermented reputed quart liquors. bottle on sale to licensed vendors. Note: The fixed fee in respect of licence FL-2: one fourth of the licence fee as obtained in the auction 763 shall be payable in advance immediately on the acceptance of the bid and the balance by such instalments as may be specified in the licence to be granted."" By the very notification dated 14th of April, 1976 the Excise Commissioner added one more condition in the form of a proviso to the terms and conditions of FL-2 Licence and the said addition made after condition No. 1 (c), runs thus: ""Provided that the assessment fee on the sales made on the licence in the prescribed manner at such scales of surcharge fee as may be prescribed by the Government and announced at the time of the auction, shall also be payable by the licencee."" Obviously relying upon the aforesaid amendments made in the Principal Act of 1910, by Act 5 of 1976 (some of which were given retrospective effect from the date of the commencement of the Principal Act and others from 16th August 1972) and the said amended Rules 639, 641 and 642 and the insertion of the new condition in the FL-2 Licence (all of which came into force from 14th April, 1976), the respondents introduced the auction system for the grant of licences in Form FL-2 for wholesale vend of beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor and started levying and recovering the ""assessed fee"" in addition to the ""fixed fee"" (auction money) from the grantees of the licences. Question raised is whether such levy and recovery are legal and valid ? Before we deal with the question it will be desirable to set out the facts giving rise to it that lie in a narrow compass and it will suffice if the facts obtaining in Writ Petition No. 528 of 1979, being typically representative of the group, are stated. The petitioners in that petition are liquor dealers and carry on business inter alia of wholesale vend of beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor and for that purpose have wholesale depots in various districts in the State of U.P. For the financial years 1976-77 and 1977-78 they acquired by auction bids wholesale vending rights in respect of Indian Made Foreign Liquor at Agra, Meerut, Varanasi, Kanpur, Bareilly and Dehradun; for the financial year 1978-79 they similarly acquired wholesale vending rights in Indian Made Foreign Liquor at Agra, Meerut and Varanasi and for the financial year 1979-80 they acquired by auction similar rights at Agra, Meerut, Ghaziabad 764 and Pilibhit. In other words being the highest bidder at these places for these years licences for the wholesale vend of Indian Made Foreign Liquor in Form FL-2 were granted to them. At the time of acceptance of their bids at these auctions the petitioners deposited the entire auction money called the ""fixed fee"" in respect of each of the said years with the respondents. The petitioners’ case is that thereafter the respondents are seeking to levy and recover  Page 8 of 11 from them the ""assessed fee"" at the rate of Rs. 5 per quart bottle on spirits and 60 p. per quart bottle on beers actually sold during each of the financial years by their concerned shops or depots in addition the ""fixed fee"". Such levy and recovery of the ""assessed fee"" by the respondents is challenged on two or three grounds indicated hereunder. In the first place Counsel for the petitioners have contended that under s. 30(2) of the Principal Act of 1910 prior to its amendment by U.P. Ordinance No. 4 of 1979 and U.P. Act 13 of 1979 it was open to the respondents to adopt either one or the other method of granting FL-2 licences and determine the licence fee payable by the grantee accordingly, that is to say the respondents could grant the licence ""either by auction or by calling tenders"" and once a particular mode was adopted it was incumbent upon them to apply the same for the purpose of determining the sum payable by the grantee; in other words the contention has been that it was not open to them to adopt a combination of two or more methods and claim ""assessed fee"" in addition to ""fixed fee"" and therefore the instant attempt on the part of the respondents to levy and recover the ""assessed fee"" in addition to ""fixed fee"" would be illegal and without authority of law. According to the petitioners a combination of two or more methods became available to the respondents only under sec. 30(2) as amended by U.P. ordinance No. 4 of 1979 and by U.P. Act 13 of 1979. Secondly, the petitioners have averred that at the time of the said auctions held for each of the said financial years the bidders were not informed that any ""assessed fee"" had been fixed by the State Government which would be payable by the successful bidder and therefore the persons who gave their bids including the petitioners whose highest bids were accepted were led to believe that no fee over and above the auction money would be charged and that the successful bidder would be granted FL-2 licence merely on payment of the auction money. Counsel for the petitioners have therefore contended that the respondents’ attempt to levy and recover the ""assessed fee"" over 765 and above the ""fixed fee"" (auction money) is unwarranted and illegal in as much as the respondents cannot enhance the petitioners’ contractual liability which was limited to the payment of the auction money. Yet another contention raised by Counsel for the petitioners has been that as per the newly inserted condition in FL-2 licence the ""assessed fee"" was required to be ""prescribed by Government and announced at the time of auction"" but in the instant case such ""assessed fee"" has been prescribed by the Excise Commissioner and not by the State Government and was not announced at the time of the auction and for this reason also the same would not be recoverable. As will be shown presently none of these contentions has any merit and each one is liable to be rejected. As regards the first contention a plain reading of s. 30(2) prior to its amendment by U.P. Ordinance No. 4 of 1979 and by U.P. Act No. 13 of 1979 will show that there is no substance in it. The said provision ran thus: ""2. The sum payable under sub-sec. (1) may by determined either by auction or by calling tenders or otherwise."" In other words, the consideration for the grant of FL-2 licence could be determined either by auction or by calling tenders or otherwise. The phrase ""or otherwise"" was sufficiently wide and conferred on its plain grammatical construction power on the State Government or the Excise  Page 9 of 11 Commissioner to grant the licence either by auction or by tenders or partly by auction and partly by tenders or even by adopting yet other methods than by auction or by inviting tenders. In other words, the phrase ""or otherwise"" enabled the State Government or the Excise Commissioner to adopt a combination of one or more methods for granting the FL-2 licence and determine the licence fee accordingly. Having regard to the phrase ""or otherwise"" occurring in the provision it is impossible to accept the contention that only one method to the exclusion of the others could be adopted by the respondents for granting the licence or that one type of fee appropriate to that method could alone be charged. It is true that sub-sec. (2) of s. 30 as amended by U.P. Ordinance No. 4 of 1979 or by U.P. Act No. 13 of 1979 runs thus: ""2. The sum payable under sub-sec. (1) may either be fixed by auction or inviting tenders or otherwise or be assessed on the basis of the sales made or quota lifted 766 under the licence or partly fixed and partly assessed in the aforesaid manner."" But in our view it is manifestly clear that the aforesaid amended provision is clarificatory of the legal position which obtained under sec. 30(2) that was operative prior to the said amendment. In this view of the matter the first contention has to be rejected. The second contention has been that since at the time of holding the concerned auctions the bidders were not informed that any ""assessed fee"" had been prescribed by the State Government which would be payable by the successful bidder and since bids were offered on the representation that the successful bidder would be granted FL-2 licence merely on payment of the ""fixed fee"" (auction money) the respondents’ attempt to levy and recover the ""assessed fee"" over and above the ""fixed fee"" would be unwarranted and illegal because the respondents cannot enhance the contractual liability of the successful bidder which was limited to payment of the auction money. There are two answers to this contention. In the first place it was not disputed before us that to the knowledge of all the bidders these auctions for the grant of FL-2 licences were held under the provisions of the Principal Act of 1910 as amended by Act 5 of 1976 and the Rules framed thereunder which were then in force. We have already referred to the provisions of the amended Rules 639(2), 641 and 642 which were published in the Gazette and brought into force with effect from 14th of April, 1976 and admittedly all auctions for the financial year 1976-77 were held subsequent to that date. Under the amended Rule 641 it was clearly provided that the fee for the FL-2 licence shall be the amount of money accepted at the auction of the licence as ""fixed fee"" together with the ""assessed fee"" charged on the basis of the scales of Surcharge fee prescribed in the next following Rule and the amended Rule 642 prescribed the scales at which the ""assessed fee"" would be so charged. In other words, the bidders who gave their bids must be deemed to have knowledge of the provisions of the aforesaid Rules subject to which the auctions were held and therefore it is difficult to accept the contention that the bidders including the successful bidder whose highest bid was accepted offered their bids believing that only ""fixed fee"" would be charged. Secondly, the averment of the petitioners that at the time of these auctions the bidders were not informed that any ""assessed fee"" had been fixed or prescribed which would be   11 payable by the successful bidder is not quite correct. It has been admitted by the petitioners that at the time of these 767 auctions the new condition that was inserted by the Excise Commissioner in the FL-2 licence by his Notification dated 14th April, 1976 was read out and this newly inserted condition runs thus: ""Provided that the assessment fee on the sales made on the licence in the prescribed manner at such scales of surcharge fee as may be prescribed by the Government and announced at the time of the auction, shall also be payable by licensee"". If admittedly the aforesaid condition inserted in FL-2 licence was read out at the time of the auction then it is clear that the fact that ""assessed fee"" on the sales made on the licence was also payable by the licensee was announced at the time of the auction. The only grievance made by the petitioners has been that the prescribed scales of surcharge fee (under Rule 642) were not announced but that is neither here nor there, for, if once it was announced at the time of the auction that ""assessed fee"" on sales effected on the licence at the prescribed scales shall also be payable by the licensee then obviously the bidders were put on enquiry to find out what scales of surcharge fee had been prescribed under the relevant Rule. In other words the bidders present at these auctions had full knowledge that ""assessed fee"" at prescribed rates will also be charged and it was with full knowledge of this position that they gave their bids. If that be so, there is no question of the respondents’ attempting to enhance the contractual liability of the successful bidder. It will be interesting to mention in this context that the respondents have stated in their counter affidavit that not only did the bidders know that ""assessed fee"" would be charged over and above the ""fixed fee"" (auction money) but many of the successful bidders to whom FL-2 licences were granted have actually passed on the ""assessed fee"" at the prescribed rates to and recovered the same from the retailers to whom they have effected sales of beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor. At least in the case of those petitioners before us who have done so the aforesaid plea put forward on their behalf cannot be regarded as honest. The second contention therefore fails and is rejected. The last contention is merely required to be stated to be rejected. In support of that contention reliance was placed on the newly inserted condition in FL-2 licence which states that the assessed fee ""at such scales of surcharge fee as may be prescribed by the Government"" shall also be payable by the licensee while 768 actually the scales of surcharge fee have been prescribed by the Excise Commissioner by framing the amended Rule 642 in exercise of the powers conferred upon him by cl. (c) of 41 of the Principal Act. Counsel urged that scales of surcharge fee ought to have been prescribed by the Government. In this connection we might refer to sec. 24B(c) which expressly declares that ""the Excise Commissioner as the head of the Excise Department of the State shall be deemed, while determining or realising such fee, to act for and on behalf of the State Government"". It is thus clear that the Excise Commissioner has been statutorily declared to be the agent of the State Government and ""while determining such fee"" by framing the amended Rule 642 he acted for and on behalf of the State Government. In other words, scales of ""assessed   of 11 fee"" under Rule 642 must be deemed to have been prescribed by the State Government. As regards the alleged non announcement at the time of the auctions we have already dealt with that aspect of the matter while dealing with and disposing of the second contention. No other point was raised. It is therefore clear that the levy and recovery of the ""assessed fee"" over and above the ""fixed fee"" by the respondents for granting FL-2 licences to all the petitioners would be legal and valid under the U.P. Excise Principal Act of 1910 as amended by Act 5 of 1976 and the amended Rules framed there under and all the petitions are liable to be dismissed. We accordingly dismiss all the writ petitions with costs and quantify the costs payable by each of the petitioners separately at Rs. 5000. S.R. Petitions dismissed. 76"

70,,RAMAKANT MAYEKAR,SMT. CELINE D’SILVA,11/12/1995,"BENCH: VERMA, JAGDISH SARAN (J) BENCH: VERMA, JAGDISH SARAN (J) SINGH N.P. (J) VENKATASWAMI K. (J)","JUDGMENT J.S. VERMA, J. : This is an appeal by the returned candidate under Section 116A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (for short ""the R.P. Act"") against the judgment dated 5th/6th August, 1991 in Election Petition No. 21 of 1990 by S.N. Variava, J. of the Bombay High Court whereby the election of the appellant to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly from 49-Kurla Legislative Constituency held on 27.2.1990 has been declared to be void on the ground under Section 100(1)(b) for commission of corrupt practices under sub-section (3) and (3A) of the R.P. Act. By the said judgment, the learned Judge has decided the election petition and made the order under Section 98 declaring the election of the appellant to be void but the findings on issue Nos. 2 and 5 have been reserved for being recorded after the inquiry under Section 99 of the R.P. Act is concluded against Chhagan Bhujbal, Pramod Mahajan, Bal Thackeray, Manohar Joshi and Pramod Navalkar to whom notices   of 14 have been issued under Section 99 of the R.P. Act by the order made therein. The ultimate conclusion in the final order made in the impugned judgment is quite involved because of the unusual mode adopted of deciding the election petition piecemeal. Instead of attempting to summarise the conclusion, it is safer to quote certain portions of the concluding part of the judgment, as under : ""I"" have already held that the cassette was displayed in the Constituency with the consent of the Respondent. There is however no proof that it was personally exhibited by the Respondent. Accordingly it will have to be held that, by mode of display of this video cassette, some other persons with the consent of the Respondent have committed the corrupt practice of appealing for votes on the ground of the Respondent’s religion i.e. Hindu religion and have attempted to create enmity and hatred between different communities and religions particularly Hindu and Muslims. On this count itself, the election of the Respondent must be set aside. Accordingly, Issues Nos. 3 and 6 have been answered in the Affirmative and Issue Nos. 1 and 4 have been answered in the Negatives. However, before the final order is passed the last and the main mode of canvassing i.e. by means of the speeches made by Mr. Bal Thackeray and the other leaders of the Shiv Sena and B.J.P. alliance at the meetings held on 29th January, 1990 and 24th February, 1990, has to be considered. I have read the speeches of Mr. Bal Thackeray, Mr. Pramod Mahajan, Mr. Chaggan Bhujbal, Mr. Manohar Mahajan, Mr. Pramod Navalkar........ On reading of these speeches, I am of the prima-facie opinion that all the abovenamed persons have by their speeches committed the corrupt practice of having appealed for votes on the ground of the Respondents community and religion i.e. Hindu community and religion. They have also, prima-facie at least, committed the corrupt practice of attempting to create enmity and hatred between different classes of citizens on the basis of religion and community, particularly between Hindus and Muslims. I have already set out above that in cases like the present the consent of the Respondent can be and is implied. As stated above the effect and import of the entire speech has to be considered. At this prima-facie stage it is therefore not possible to pin point any particular portion or portions. That can only by done after hearing the import and effect and interpretation of the speeches from the person who made the speeches. Thus before I express my final  Page 3 of 14 opinion I intend to issue notices under Section 99 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 to all the above named persons. thus the answer to Issues 2 and 5 has been reserved till after the final disposal of the Notices issued hereunder. Accordingly, I direct that separate Notices under Section 99 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 be issued to Mr. Bal Thackeray, Mr. Manohar Joshi, Mr. Chaggan Bhujbal, Mr. Pramod Navalkar and Mr. Pramod Mahajan........ To each Notice shall also be annexed a copy of this Judgment. In each Notice it will be pointed that in the Judgment it is already held that the concerned speech/speeches were with the implied consent of the Respondent."" xxx xxx xxx ""As it has been held that corrupt practice has been committed by mode of wall paintings and display of video cassettes, the petition is made absolute in terms of prayers (a) and (b) i.e. the Election of the Respondent to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election held on 27th February, 190 from Constituency No. 49 i.e. Kurla Constituency is declared as null and void. This is on the ground that corrupt practice set out above under sub sections (3) and (3A) of Section 123 of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951 have been proved to have been committed with the consent of the Respondent i.e. that there has been an appeal to vote for the Respondent in the name of his religion i.e. Hindu religion and an attempt has been made to promote feelings classes of citizens of India on the ground of religion and community."" (emphasis supplied) After the impugned judgement was rendered, notices under Section 99 of the R.P. Act were issued to the aforesaid five persons who then raised certain preliminary objections to the validity of the notices. Variava, J. by his order dated 6.1.1992 rejected those objections. The notices given to these persons related to certain speeches alleged to have been made by them on 29.1.1990 and 24.2.1990 which, it was alleged, constituted corrupt practices under Sections 123(3) and 123(3A) of the R.P. Act. In the said order dated 6.1.1992, Variava, J. has mentioned certain facts in the background of which the objections to the notices under Section 99 were considered in that order. Those facts mentioned at the outset in the said order are as under : ""Petition No. 21 of 1990 is not an individual Election Petition before this Court. In respect of the same elections i.e. the elections to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly held in February 1990, ten such petitions have been filed before this Court. All of these are against various successful candidates of  Page 4 of 14 Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party. All these petitions are based on a plank of Hindutva/Hinduism alleged to have been adopted by these parties and allegedly declared by their leaders at the joint Public meetings held by these two parties on 29th January 1990 and 24th February 1990. In all these petitions the charges are that the respective respondents, their election agents and/or some other persons have with the consent of the respective Respondents, committed corrupt practices of appealing for votes on the grounds of the candidates religion, community and casts viz. Hindu religion, community and caste and the corrupt practice of creating enmity and hatred between various classes of citizens on the ground of religion, community and caste particularly between Hindus and Muslims. Thus the charges are under Secs. 123(3) and 123(3A) of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951. The mode of resorting to these corrupt practices have been by way of speeches made by the leaders of the two parties at the joint meetings held on 29th January, 1990 and 24th February, 1990, by use of offending poster, banners, wall writings and a video cassette ""Awahan and Avhan"". This is the same material in all these Petitions. Then in individual Petitions, there are allegations of speeches made in the individual constituencies, either by the respective Respondent of somebody else with his consent. In this Petition also, the charges against the Respondent and the alleged mode of canvassing are the same. Thus the charge is that the Respondent, his election agents and/or some other persons have with his consent, committed the corrupt practices of appealing for votes on the grounds of the Respondents religion, community and caste viz. Hindu religion, community and caste and the corrupt practice of creating enmity and hatred between various classes of citizens on the ground of religion, community and caste particularly between Hindus and Muslims. Thus the charges are under Secs. 123 (3) and 123 (3A) of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951. In this Petition also the alleged mode of resorting to these corrupt practices is by way of speeches made by the leaders of Shiv Sena and B.J.P. at the joint public meetings held on 29th January 1990 (at Shivaji Park) and by use of offending posters, banners, wall writings and the video cassette ‘Awahan and avhan’."" (emphasis supplied) At the beginning of the impugned judgment, the scope of  Page 5 of 14 the election petition and the true perspective in which it has to be decided has been stated by Variava, J. as under : ""It must also be noted that these group of petitions are to a large extent unlike other election petitions. This because these petitions are not based upon individual acts of individuals. They are mainly based upon the abovementioned plank and/or policy decision of these parties. This will have a bearing on the question of consent. It is therefore necessary to note the make up of the Shiv Sena party. This already forms part of two Judgments of this court."" xxx xxx xxx ""......... Unlike other Election Petitions the main charge is not of an individual corrupt practice committed b an individual candidate in his constituency. really speaking, the charge against the candidate is the charge of implementing the plank as decided by the party........ In my view, in cases like this, where the plank has been declared by the leader of the party and the leader of the party has complete control of the affairs of the party, once it is proved and held, that the plank declared by the leader amounts to a corrupt practice, every candidate of that party will be bound by that plank...... As is set out hereafter, prima-facie it does appear that the plank of Hindutva/Hinduism, as declared by the leaders at these two meetings amounts to the corrupt practice of appealing for votes in the name of the Hindu candidates religion and also amounts to the corrupt practice of attempting to create enmity and hatred between different classes of citizens on the grounds of community and religion, particularly between Hindus and Muslims......."" It is this perception of Variava, J. which has coloured his entire judgment and led to the decision of the election petition, not confined to the record of the case but extending to all the general impressions. An objection expressly taken to the validity of the notices that they could not be issued after the election petition had been decided by making an order under Section 98 of the R.P. Act was rejected by order dated 6.1.1992. The connected Civil Appeal No. 93 of 1992 by Chhagan Bhujbal, Civil Appeal No. 94 of 1992 by Pramod Mahajan and Civil Appeal No. 2396 of 1992 by Balasaheb Thackeray, are against the order dated 6.1.1992 passed by Variava, J. rejecting the objections of these notices to the validity of notice issued under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. The inquiry required to be made under Section 99 of the R.P. Act has not yet been made in the High Court against any of the notices in view of the pendency of these appeals. It may be mentioned that two remaining notices Pramod Navalkar and Manohar Joshi had filed Civil Appeal No. 149 of 1992 and Civil Appeal No. 795 of 1992 against rejection of their objections to the notices  Page 6 of 14 but those appeals have been summarily dismissed on 19.8.1993 and 7.9.1993 apparently leaving open the question of validity of the notices to be decided at a later stage. There is no dispute at the hearing of these appeals that the case of all the five notices has to be dealt with in the same manner depending on the final outcome of these appeals. We would now consider the points which arise for decision. Dismissal of Election Petition under Section 86 of the R.P. Act, 1951. The first submission in these appeals is that the election petition was liable to be dismissed under Section 86 of the R.P. Act for non-compliance of sub section (1) of Section 81, inasmuch as the election petition was filed after expiry of the prescribed period of 45 days from the date of election. Acceptance of the nominations of the candidates was on 8.2.1990, the date of poll was 27.2.1990 and the result of election was declared on 1.3.1990 at which Ramakant Mayekar was declared elected. The election petition was filed on 16.4.1990. Admittedly the last date for filing the election petition according to the prescribed period of 45 days was 14.4.1990, but the High Court and its office were closed for holidays on 14th and 15th April, 1990 and reopened only on 16.4.1990. If Section 10 of the General Clauses Act applies, then the election petition filed on 16.4.1990 was within time. We have already held in the connected Civil Appeal No. 4973 of 1993 - Manohar Joshi vs. Nitin Bhaurao Patil & Anr. - decided today, that Section 10 of the General Clauses Act applies to an election petition. It must, therefore, be held that this election petition was filed within time. This argument on behalf of the appellant is, therefore, rejected. Meaning and Effect of Sections 98 and 99 of the R.P. Act, 1951. The next question for consideration is the legality of deciding the election petition and declaring the election of the returned candidate to be void by making an order under Section 98 of the R.P. Act, and then proceeding to issue notice under Section 99 to the aforesaid five persons on the basis of speeches alleged to have been made by them on 29.1.1990 and 24.2.1990 which form the basis of the ground under Section 100(1)(b) for declaring the election to be void. The question really is: Whether notice under Section 99 of the R.P. Act can be issued for commission of a corrupt practice, after making an order deciding the election petition and declaring the election of the returned candidate to be void? This specific objection taken by the notices has been rejected by Variava, J. The legality of this view arises for consideration. As for the speeches alleged to have been made on 29.1.1990, it may be stated at the outset that they have to be excluded from consideration since they cannot form the basis of any corrupt practice at the election, inasmuch as they relate to a period prior to the date on which Ramakant Mayekar became a candidate at the election as defined in Section 79(b) of the R.P. Act. This is the settled position in law. [See Subhash Desai vs. Sharad J. Rao and Others, 1994 Supp. (2) SCC 446; Indira Nehru Gandhi vs. Raj Narain, 1975 Supp. SCC 1; Mohan Rawale vs. Damodar Tatyaba, 1994 (2) SCC 392]. This was the undisputed position at the hearing of these appeals before us since the speeches mad eon 29.1.1990 were prior to the date on which Ramakant Mayekar became a candidate at the election. It follows necessarily that the impugned judgment as well as the subsequent notices issued under Section 99 of the R.P. Act, are unsustainable to the  Page 7 of 14 extent they are based on the speeches alleged to have been made on 29.1.1990. No further discussion is necessary for holding that part of the impugned judgment dated 5th/6th August, 1991, notices under Section 99 of the R.P. Act and the subsequent order dated 6th January, 1992 as contrary to law and, therefore, liable to be set aside for this reason alone. It is only the surviving part of the impugned judgment and the notices which require further consideration, for which purpose the question for decision at the threshold is the validity of the course adopted of deciding the election petition and declaring the election of the returned candidate to be void and then proceeding to give notices for taking action under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. We have already indicated the combined effect of Sections 98 and 99 of the R.P. Act in the connected Civil Appeal No. 4973 of 1993 - Manohar Joshi vs. Nitin Bhaurao Patil & Anr. - decided today. The correct legal position has been overlooked by the High Court. The High Court appears to have misread the decision of this Court in D.P. Mishra vs. Kamal Narayan Sharma and Anr., 1971 (1) SCR 8, to form the opinion that the course adopted by it was permissible under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. The question in that case was of the failure to issue notice under Section 99 of the R.P. Act to a person alleged to have committed the corrupt practice for which the returned candidate also was guilty. The High Court, in the appeal, did not comply with the requirement of Section 99 for avoiding further delay. This Court rejected that view as incorrect and held as under : ""We are unable to agree with the view so propounded by the High Court. Under s. 99 of the Act the Court has no discretion in the matter, if the Court was of the view that any person who is proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt practice, not to name that person. It is true that preliminary objections were argued at an earlier stage, but Sharma could not before the appeal was heard ask the Court to issue a notice under s. 99 of the Act on the footing that his case which was rejected by the Tribunal will be accepted. The duty under the Act is cast upon the Court or the Tribunal, and on the ground that the party has not applied for a notice, the High Court could not avoid the obligation imposed by statute to take proceeding under s. 99 against the person proved at the trial to have been guilty of corrupt practice and to name him. We fail also to appreciate the ground on which the High Court has referred to delay being an ""outweighing factor"". Shyamacharan Shukla was however not a party to the proceeding and before he could be named a notice must go to him under s. 99 of the Act. We direct that the proceeding be remanded to the High Court and the High Court do give notice to Shyamacharan Shukla under s. 99 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, to appear and to show cause why he should not be named  Page 8 of 14 for committing corrupt practices. If Shyamacharan Shukla appears in pursuance of the show cause notice he will be entitled to an opportunity of cross examining witnesses who have already been examined by the Tribunal and has given evidence against him and he will be entitled to give evidence in his defence and of being heard..... (at pages 29-30) There is nothing in this decision to support the view taken by the High Court that it could decide the election petition and make an order under Section 98 declaring the election of the returned candidate to be void and then proceed under Section 99 of the R.P. Act against the other persons. It is, therefore, clear that the impugned judgment dated 5th/6th August, 1991 declaring the appellant’s election to be void and the subsequent order dated 6.1.1992 rejecting the preliminary objections to the notice issued subsequently under Section 99, both by Variava, J., are contrary to law and have to be set aside. We have not to determine the nature of the final order to be made. Speeches We have already indicated that the speeches alleged to have been made on 29.1.1990 are irrelevant and have to be excluded from consideration as earlier stated. In respect of the speeches alleged to have been made on 24.2.1990, the relevant portions of the impugned judgment are as under : ""The question then is whether the Respondent was also present at the meeting held on 24th February 1990. Here again the petitioner has admitted that her only source of knowledge are newspaper reports. In this case however, not a single newspaper report support the case that all 34 candidates were present or that the Respondent was present....... Thus the only evidence of Respondent’s presence at this meeting is this photo. The court has looked at the photo and the Respondent a number of times. It is not possible to categorically state that this is the photo of the Respondent. If that be so, then the benefit of doubt must be given to the Respondent. Thus, there is no evidence before this court to show that the Respondent was present at the meeting held on 24th February 1990. If that be so, then the question of considering the Respondent’s case, why he was not present at this meeting does not arise at all. It was for the petitioner to satisfy the court that the Respondent was present at this meeting. The petitioner has failed to do that. Therefore, so far as the meeting of 24th February, 1990 is concerned, it is not possible to hold that the Respondent was present at that meeting."" (emphasis supplied) The above finding relating to speeches by some persons other than the appellant can have relevance only if the element of appellant’s consent is also pleaded and proved. The  Page 9 of 14 appellant’s consent was attempted to be made out by implication only from the fact of his personal presence when those speeches were made. However, the above conclusion reached by the High Court shows that the appellant’s presence at the meeting was not found to be proved. This being so, the element of candidate’s consent which is a constituent part of the corrupt practice alleged on the basis of speeches made on 24.2.1990 by some other persons has not been found proved. That finding alone is sufficient to reject the allegation of corrupt practice on the basis of speeches made by others on 24.2.1990, as not proved. When this is the conclusion reached in respect of the appellant himself with regard to the allegation of corrupt practice based on speeches made by others on 24.2.1990, then the question of recording a finding that the corrupt practice has been proved, does not arise and, therefore, the further question of naming any other person who could have been proved at the trial to be guilty of the corrupt practice under Section 99 of the R.P. Act does not arise. The pleading in respect of speeches made in the public meeting held at Shivaji Park, Dadar on 24.2.1990 is in paras 22, 23 and generally in para 27 of the election petition. These are the only portions of the election petition on which reliance is placed by learned counsel for the respondent as the pleading on this point. It is pleaded in para 22 that the speeches were made by Bal Thackeray and other leaders of the alliance in that meeting where the present appellant (respondent in the election petition) and all other candidates of Shiv Sena - BJP alliance were present. Thereafter, in paras 23 and 27, there is only a general averment that the appeal made by Bal Thackeray and other leaders to the voters was with the consent of the appellant (respondent in the election petition). No fact other than the averment of personal presence of the appellant was pleaded to make out the consent of the appellant required for constituting the corrupt practice. As earlier indicated, the High Court has held that the presence of the appellant at that meeting has not been proved. Thus, the only basis for pleading and attempting to prove the appellant’s consent to the making of those speeches in the meeting held on 24.2.1990 has been held to be not proved. There is thus no foundation even for a tentative finding of any corrupt practice on the basis of speeches alleged to have been made by Bal Thackeray and some other leaders in this case against the present appellant, inasmuch as a necessary ingredient of the corrupt practice, i.e., consent of the appellant has been found to be not proved. There being not even a tentative basis to hold the charge of this corrupt practice proved against the appellant, the further question of invoking Section 99 to name any other person for the commission of that corrupt practice along with the returned candidate does not arise. In short, the finding of corrupt practice against the appellant on the basis of speeches alleged to have been made by some leaders in the meeting of 24.2.1990 being unsustainable, this charge has to fail and no occasion arises in the present case for taking any action under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. This part of the impugned judgment as well as the remaining part of the notices under Section 99 of the R.P. Act also have to be set aside. The only surviving question now is whether the impugned judgment, to the extent it survives against the appellant on the basis of wall paintings and video cassettes can be sustained. Wall Paintings   14 After the above conclusion reached in respect of the speeches alleged to have been made by some leaders on 29.1.1990 and 24.2.1990 for the reasons already given, the only remaining findings of corrupt practice recorded by the High Court are based on certain wall paintings and video cassette which have been found to constitute the corrupt practices under Section 123(3) and 123(3A) of the R.P. Act. We would now examine these findings on merits. The pleading relating to the allegation of corrupt practice based on wall paintings is contained in para 21 of the election petition which is as under : ""The petitioner states that the respondent and his agents with the consent of the respondent have also used posters, banners and wall paintings canvassing to vote for the respondent, appealing the voters to vote for the respondent in the name of Hindu religion. The petitioner has got the photographs taken of such wall paintings. The petitioner craves leave to refer to and rely upon the said photographs as and when produced."" (emphasis supplied) Except for repeating the words of the statute prescribing the corrupt practice, there is no pleading of the material facts or any particulars necessary to constitute the corrupt practice as required by Section 83(1) of the R.P. Act. Reference is made to certain photographs of the alleged wall paintings and it has been said that the photographs would be relied on as and when produced. The contents or form of the wall paintings or their photographs has not been pleaded and the photographs referred in para 21 of the election petition were neither annexed to the election petition nor copy thereof furnished to the returned candidate along with a copy of the petition. Thus, there is no pleading in the election petition of the language or contents of the wall paintings which were alleged to constitute the corrupt practice of canvassing for votes in the name of Hindu religion. If the mere mention of photographs without indicating its contents in the election petition is to be construed as incorporation of its contents by reference in the election petition, then non-supply of the copy of the photographs with the copy of the election petition would result in non compliance of Section 81(3). However, since the photographs were not annexed to the election petition, it is a case not of non-compliance of Section 81(3) but a case of total absence of any pleading in the election petition of the corrupt practice on the basis of wall paintings. Therefore, the pleading being wholly deficient in material facts necessary to constitute the cause of action, it was insufficient to raise a triable issue on that basis. In fact, this part of the pleading was liable to be struck out since it was irrelevant at the trial for the reason stated. It is clear that any evidence adduced later, in the absence of the requisite pleading of this corrupt practice was irrelevant and inadmissible and should not have been recorded and having been recorded must be excluded from consideration. The finding of the High Court of any corrupt practice being proved on this basis is contrary to law, and has to be set aside for this reason alone. In view of the above conclusion in relation to the wall paintings, any further discussion of the finding recorded by Variava, J. on this question would be unnecessary but for   of 14 the serious grievance made to the mode of the trial. Since the finding reflects the common perception which influenced the trial and decision of the several election petitions in the High Court as mentioned in the impugned judgment, it becomes necessary to refer to the discussion on this point in the impugned judgment. As indicated earlier, no triable issue arose in the absence of proper pleadings relating to the corrupt practice alleged on the ground of wall paintings, much less an occasion for a finding adverse to the returned candidate on this point. Surprisingly, evidence was recorded of the alleged contents of the said wall paintings through production of certain photographs later at the trial. A description of what is seen in these photographs is given in the impugned judgment to indicate that they showed the saffron flag and election symbol of the Shiv Sena and sought votes for the Shiv Sena candidates. The judgment then refers to the English translation of the slogans therein which reads, as under : ""...... In order to remove the brokers of corruption, let us throw around the Gulal of Hindutva""..... ""the lady sits angrily in Delhi Court, save Maharashtra by electing Sena-BJP""....... ""Our determination is firm. Stamp on the Bow and Arrow"" and ""Keep Hindutva awake, elect the bow and arrow.""....... ""for the protection of fiery Hindutva the Shiv Sena BJP candidate......"" The judgement then proceeds to hold as under : ""...... There can be no doubt that the ""Hindutva"" in these wall-paintings is the same ""Hindutva"" contained in the video cassettes ""Awahan and Avhan"". They are therefore an appeal to vote for Shiv Sena BJP candidates viz. The Respondent for protection of that ""Hindutva"". As is set out hereafter an appeal in the name of ""Hindutva"" amounts to an appeal to vote for the Hindu candidates of Shiv Sena BJP on the ground of their religion and also amounts to the corrupt practice or creating enmity and hatred amongst different classes of citizens on the grounds of religion and community. These paintings on walls and pipelines therefore amount to having appealed to the voters to vote for the Respondent on the ground of his religion and also amount to the corrupt practice of creating enmity and hatred amongst different classes of citizens on the grounds of religion and community."" Thereafter, the discussion relates to the consent of the candidate which is unnecessary in view of the earlier conclusion. The tenor of the impugned judgment, particularly the above extract, leaves no doubt that the High Court was of the view that any appeal for votes wherein was made of ""Hindutva"" is by itself sufficient to amount to an appeal for votes for the Hindu candidates of Shiv Sena-BJP on the ground of their religion and is a corrupt practice or creates enmity and hatred amongst different classes of citizens on the grounds of religion and community. The above   of 14 extract from the decision itself is sufficient to indicate the erroneous perception in this behalf which is clearly contrary to law. The distinction between sub-section (3) and (3A) of Section 123 which are two different corrupt practices, was totally lost sight of, and obliterated. Moreover, the use of the word ""Hindutva"" in the abstract was understood by the High Court to amount to an appeal for votes on the ground of Hindu religion if the candidate happened to be a Hindu to constitute the corrupt practice under sub-section (3); and at the same time this alone without anything more has been held to also constitute the corrupt practice under sub-section (3A) of Section 123, totally obliterating the distinction between these two sub sections of Section 123 constituting two different corrupt practices. Unfortunately, this erroneous construction of the statute leading to the formation of a wrong perception, led the High Court to commit the several errors commencing with the treating of deficient pleadings to be sufficient to raise a triable issue of a corrupt practice. This extraordinary procedure, impermissible in law, led to reception of considerable irrelevant and inadmissible evidence for which no basis can be found in the election petition. In short, the trial of the election petition became a roving inquiry into the affairs of a political party when the only concern at the trial should have been the merit of the charge of corrupt practices attributed to the returned candidate at the election. Actions of the party were relevant only to the extent relatable to the returned candidate, in the manner pleaded in the election petition. Unfortunately, this crucial factor was overlooked by the High Court in the trial of the election petition. In the abstract, the meaning of the word ""Hindutva"" is not confined only to Hindu religion unrelated to Indian culture and heritage and it is the context and the manner of its use which determines its true meaning in a particular speech. The kind of use made of the word ""Hindutva"", the context and the composition of the audience to which the speech is addressed, are all significant. In the connected Civil Appeal No. 2453 of 1991 - Shri Suryakant Venkatrao Mahadik vs. Smt. Saroj Sandesh Naik (Bhosale) - decided today, we have indicated how the use of the word ""Hindutva"" in the context and in the circumstances in which it was used in that case amounted to an appeal for votes on the ground of Hindu religion for a Hindu candidate. As a proposition of law, it cannot be said that in the abstract, the mere use of the word ""Hindutva"" during an election campaign must necessarily mean an appeal on the ground of Hindu religion for a Hindu candidate. We have discussed this question at some length in the connected Civil Appeal No. 2835 of 1989 Bal Thackeray vs. Prabhakar K. Kunte and Ors. - (with Civil Appeal No. 2836 of 1989) decided today. It is unnecessary to reiterate the same herein. What is forbidden by law is an appeal by a candidate for votes on the ground of ‘his’ religion or promotion etc. of hatred or enmity between groups of people, and not the mere mention of religion. There can be no doubt that mention made of any religion in the context of secularism or for criticising the anti-secular stance of any political party or candidate cannot amount to a corrupt practice under sub section (3) or (3A) of Section 123. In other words it is a question of fact in each case and not a proposition of law as understood and enunciated by the High Court. The view taken by the High Court in the impugned judgment indicates a wrong perception based on a mis  Page 13 of 14 construction of sub-sections (3) and (3A) of Section 123, obliterating at the same time the distinction in the two corrupt practices defined in these two provisions. The finding of the High Court of proof of the corrupt practice based on wall paintings in also, therefore, set aside. Video Cassette The only surviving question now relates to the corrupt practice alleged on the basis of certain video cassettes. The pleading is in paras 15 to 18 of the election petition. There is a general averment that the alliance had taken out video cassettes for the purpose of its election campaign and that they were exhibited at various places in the constituency. It is alleged that the contents of the video cassettes amounted to appeal for votes in the name of Hindu religion and they tended to create enmity and hatred amongst the voters on the basis of caste, creed and religion. The only specific fact pleaded apart from the general averment, contained in para 18 is as under : ""..... Bal Thackeray also boasted that if any one is obstructing the Hindu religion, he will fix him. That they (Shiv Sena) will stop all offering of ""Namaz"" on roads and bring down the loudspeakers from the mosques. Bal Thackeray has gone to the extent of coaxing the voters to scream aloud that they will not tolerate any one coming into power with the help of Muslim votes."" It is significant that here also the pleadings are deficient and the only averment which may be treated as specific is the above extract attributing certain speech to Bal Thackeray of which also no particulars are given. The requisite pleading of the candidate’s consent for this act of Bal Thackeray to constitute a corrupt practice by the candidate (appellant) is not pleaded apart from the general pleading of consent elsewhere. This state of pleading relating even to the video cassettes, when the video cassettes or its transcript were not produced along with the election petition or its copy furnished with the copy of the election petition to the appellant, is a serious defect in the pleading which once again has been totally overlooked at the trial of this election petition. This again has resulted in raising an issue for which the requisite pleadings were not there and then admitting considerable evidence which is irrelevant and inadmissible. We have considered this question at length in the connected Civil Appeal No. 4973 of 1993 - Manohar Joshi vs. Nitin Bhaurao Patil & Anr. - decided today. For the same reasons, the entire issue relating to the corrupt practice based on the video cassettes has to be excluded from consideration. Even otherwise the only specific pleading on the point which is extracted above is insufficient to plead this corrupt practice against the appellant, howsoever reprehensible it may be in relation to the alleged conduct of Bal Thackeray. The more fact that Bal Thackeray was leader of Shiv Sena of which party the appellant was a candidate is by itself not sufficient to hold any candidate guilty of the corrupt practice on the basis of an act done by Bal Thackeray unless that liability can be fastened on the candidate on further proof that the act was done with the consent of the candidate or the display of that cassette was made with the candidate’s consent at the specified time and place etc. during his election campaign. All these  Page 14 of 14 material facts were required to be pleaded and proved, but, instead, they have been assumed and even the finding is not related to any such specific act. The requisite consent of the candidate cannot be assumed merely from the fact that the candidate belongs to the same political party of which the wrong doer was a leader since there can be no presumption in law that there is consent of every candidate of the political party for every act done by every acknowledged leader of that party. The corrupt practice for which a candidate can be held vicariously guilty for an act of any other person who is not his agent in whose favour general authority is presumed, must be pleaded and proved to be with the consent of the candidate. Obviously, it is so because the penal consequences resulting from the finding of a corrupt practice against the candidate are visited on the candidate including the setting aside of his election. The High Court assumed for the purpose of pleading as well as proof that no specific pleading or proof of consent of the candidate was necessary if the act was attributed to any leader or even a member of the same political party. The distinction between the ground in Section 100(1)(b) on which the election petition was allowed and that under Section 100(1)(d)(ii) was completely missed. Admittedly, the ground under Section 100(1)(d)(ii) is neither the basis of the election petition nor is it of the judgment of the High Court. It is this erroneous assumption made of the law as an abstract proposition, which has resulted in the several serious errors in the trial as well as in the impugned judgment. This discussion is sufficient to set aside the only remaining finding against the appellant. From the above discussion, it follows that the findings on all points against the appellant, of the corrupt practices held to be proved against the appellant, have to be set aside, and so also the impugned judgment dated 5th/6th August, 1991, resulting in dismissal of the election petition. The notices issued by the High Court under Section 99 of the R.P. Act to Chhagan Bhujbal, Bal Thackeray, Pramod Mahajan, Manohar Joshi and Pramod Navalkar after conclusion of the trial must also be quashed for the above reasons. The result of this decision is that the inquiry against Pramod Navalkar and Manohar Joshi pending in the High Court in this matter also terminates. The appeals are allowed. The appellant Ramakant Mayekar would get costs throughout from the respondent Smt. Celine D’Silva (election petitioner). The other parties will bear their own costs throughout","JUDGMENT J.S. VERMA, J. : This is an appeal by the returned candidate under Section 116A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (for short ""the R.P. Act"") against the judgment dated 5th/6th August, 1991 in Election Petition No. 21 of 1990 by S.N. Variava, J. of the Bombay High Court whereby the election of the appellant to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly from 49-Kurla Legislative Constituency held on 27.2.1990 has been declared to be void on the ground under Section 100(1)(b) for commission of corrupt practices under sub-section (3) and (3A) of the R.P. Act. By the said judgment, the learned Judge has decided the election petition and made the order under Section 98 declaring the election of the appellant to be void but the findings on issue Nos. 2 and 5 have been reserved for being recorded after the inquiry under Section 99 of the R.P. Act is concluded against Chhagan Bhujbal, Pramod Mahajan, Bal Thackeray, Manohar Joshi and Pramod Navalkar to whom notices   of 14 have been issued under Section 99 of the R.P. Act by the order made therein. The ultimate conclusion in the final order made in the impugned judgment is quite involved because of the unusual mode adopted of deciding the election petition piecemeal. Instead of attempting to summarise the conclusion, it is safer to quote certain portions of the concluding part of the judgment, as under : ""I"" have already held that the cassette was displayed in the Constituency with the consent of the Respondent. There is however no proof that it was personally exhibited by the Respondent. Accordingly it will have to be held that, by mode of display of this video cassette, some other persons with the consent of the Respondent have committed the corrupt practice of appealing for votes on the ground of the Respondent’s religion i.e. Hindu religion and have attempted to create enmity and hatred between different communities and religions particularly Hindu and Muslims. On this count itself, the election of the Respondent must be set aside. Accordingly, Issues Nos. 3 and 6 have been answered in the Affirmative and Issue Nos. 1 and 4 have been answered in the Negatives. However, before the final order is passed the last and the main mode of canvassing i.e. by means of the speeches made by Mr. Bal Thackeray and the other leaders of the Shiv Sena and B.J.P. alliance at the meetings held on 29th January, 1990 and 24th February, 1990, has to be considered. I have read the speeches of Mr. Bal Thackeray, Mr. Pramod Mahajan, Mr. Chaggan Bhujbal, Mr. Manohar Mahajan, Mr. Pramod Navalkar........ On reading of these speeches, I am of the prima-facie opinion that all the abovenamed persons have by their speeches committed the corrupt practice of having appealed for votes on the ground of the Respondents community and religion i.e. Hindu community and religion. They have also, prima-facie at least, committed the corrupt practice of attempting to create enmity and hatred between different classes of citizens on the basis of religion and community, particularly between Hindus and Muslims. I have already set out above that in cases like the present the consent of the Respondent can be and is implied. As stated above the effect and import of the entire speech has to be considered. At this prima-facie stage it is therefore not possible to pin point any particular portion or portions. That can only by done after hearing the import and effect and interpretation of the speeches from the person who made the speeches. Thus before I express my final  Page 3 of 14 opinion I intend to issue notices under Section 99 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 to all the above named persons. thus the answer to Issues 2 and 5 has been reserved till after the final disposal of the Notices issued hereunder. Accordingly, I direct that separate Notices under Section 99 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 be issued to Mr. Bal Thackeray, Mr. Manohar Joshi, Mr. Chaggan Bhujbal, Mr. Pramod Navalkar and Mr. Pramod Mahajan........ To each Notice shall also be annexed a copy of this Judgment. In each Notice it will be pointed that in the Judgment it is already held that the concerned speech/speeches were with the implied consent of the Respondent."" xxx xxx xxx ""As it has been held that corrupt practice has been committed by mode of wall paintings and display of video cassettes, the petition is made absolute in terms of prayers (a) and (b) i.e. the Election of the Respondent to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election held on 27th February, 190 from Constituency No. 49 i.e. Kurla Constituency is declared as null and void. This is on the ground that corrupt practice set out above under sub sections (3) and (3A) of Section 123 of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951 have been proved to have been committed with the consent of the Respondent i.e. that there has been an appeal to vote for the Respondent in the name of his religion i.e. Hindu religion and an attempt has been made to promote feelings classes of citizens of India on the ground of religion and community."" (emphasis supplied) After the impugned judgement was rendered, notices under Section 99 of the R.P. Act were issued to the aforesaid five persons who then raised certain preliminary objections to the validity of the notices. Variava, J. by his order dated 6.1.1992 rejected those objections. The notices given to these persons related to certain speeches alleged to have been made by them on 29.1.1990 and 24.2.1990 which, it was alleged, constituted corrupt practices under Sections 123(3) and 123(3A) of the R.P. Act. In the said order dated 6.1.1992, Variava, J. has mentioned certain facts in the background of which the objections to the notices under Section 99 were considered in that order. Those facts mentioned at the outset in the said order are as under : ""Petition No. 21 of 1990 is not an individual Election Petition before this Court. In respect of the same elections i.e. the elections to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly held in February 1990, ten such petitions have been filed before this Court. All of these are against various successful candidates of  Page 4 of 14 Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party. All these petitions are based on a plank of Hindutva/Hinduism alleged to have been adopted by these parties and allegedly declared by their leaders at the joint Public meetings held by these two parties on 29th January 1990 and 24th February 1990. In all these petitions the charges are that the respective respondents, their election agents and/or some other persons have with the consent of the respective Respondents, committed corrupt practices of appealing for votes on the grounds of the candidates religion, community and casts viz. Hindu religion, community and caste and the corrupt practice of creating enmity and hatred between various classes of citizens on the ground of religion, community and caste particularly between Hindus and Muslims. Thus the charges are under Secs. 123(3) and 123(3A) of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951. The mode of resorting to these corrupt practices have been by way of speeches made by the leaders of the two parties at the joint meetings held on 29th January, 1990 and 24th February, 1990, by use of offending poster, banners, wall writings and a video cassette ""Awahan and Avhan"". This is the same material in all these Petitions. Then in individual Petitions, there are allegations of speeches made in the individual constituencies, either by the respective Respondent of somebody else with his consent. In this Petition also, the charges against the Respondent and the alleged mode of canvassing are the same. Thus the charge is that the Respondent, his election agents and/or some other persons have with his consent, committed the corrupt practices of appealing for votes on the grounds of the Respondents religion, community and caste viz. Hindu religion, community and caste and the corrupt practice of creating enmity and hatred between various classes of citizens on the ground of religion, community and caste particularly between Hindus and Muslims. Thus the charges are under Secs. 123 (3) and 123 (3A) of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951. In this Petition also the alleged mode of resorting to these corrupt practices is by way of speeches made by the leaders of Shiv Sena and B.J.P. at the joint public meetings held on 29th January 1990 (at Shivaji Park) and by use of offending posters, banners, wall writings and the video cassette ‘Awahan and avhan’."" (emphasis supplied) At the beginning of the impugned judgment, the scope of  Page 5 of 14 the election petition and the true perspective in which it has to be decided has been stated by Variava, J. as under : ""It must also be noted that these group of petitions are to a large extent unlike other election petitions. This because these petitions are not based upon individual acts of individuals. They are mainly based upon the abovementioned plank and/or policy decision of these parties. This will have a bearing on the question of consent. It is therefore necessary to note the make up of the Shiv Sena party. This already forms part of two Judgments of this court."" xxx xxx xxx ""......... Unlike other Election Petitions the main charge is not of an individual corrupt practice committed b an individual candidate in his constituency. really speaking, the charge against the candidate is the charge of implementing the plank as decided by the party........ In my view, in cases like this, where the plank has been declared by the leader of the party and the leader of the party has complete control of the affairs of the party, once it is proved and held, that the plank declared by the leader amounts to a corrupt practice, every candidate of that party will be bound by that plank...... As is set out hereafter, prima-facie it does appear that the plank of Hindutva/Hinduism, as declared by the leaders at these two meetings amounts to the corrupt practice of appealing for votes in the name of the Hindu candidates religion and also amounts to the corrupt practice of attempting to create enmity and hatred between different classes of citizens on the grounds of community and religion, particularly between Hindus and Muslims......."" It is this perception of Variava, J. which has coloured his entire judgment and led to the decision of the election petition, not confined to the record of the case but extending to all the general impressions. An objection expressly taken to the validity of the notices that they could not be issued after the election petition had been decided by making an order under Section 98 of the R.P. Act was rejected by order dated 6.1.1992. The connected Civil Appeal No. 93 of 1992 by Chhagan Bhujbal, Civil Appeal No. 94 of 1992 by Pramod Mahajan and Civil Appeal No. 2396 of 1992 by Balasaheb Thackeray, are against the order dated 6.1.1992 passed by Variava, J. rejecting the objections of these notices to the validity of notice issued under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. The inquiry required to be made under Section 99 of the R.P. Act has not yet been made in the High Court against any of the notices in view of the pendency of these appeals. It may be mentioned that two remaining notices Pramod Navalkar and Manohar Joshi had filed Civil Appeal No. 149 of 1992 and Civil Appeal No. 795 of 1992 against rejection of their objections to the notices  Page 6 of 14 but those appeals have been summarily dismissed on 19.8.1993 and 7.9.1993 apparently leaving open the question of validity of the notices to be decided at a later stage. There is no dispute at the hearing of these appeals that the case of all the five notices has to be dealt with in the same manner depending on the final outcome of these appeals. We would now consider the points which arise for decision. Dismissal of Election Petition under Section 86 of the R.P. Act, 1951. The first submission in these appeals is that the election petition was liable to be dismissed under Section 86 of the R.P. Act for non-compliance of sub section (1) of Section 81, inasmuch as the election petition was filed after expiry of the prescribed period of 45 days from the date of election. Acceptance of the nominations of the candidates was on 8.2.1990, the date of poll was 27.2.1990 and the result of election was declared on 1.3.1990 at which Ramakant Mayekar was declared elected. The election petition was filed on 16.4.1990. Admittedly the last date for filing the election petition according to the prescribed period of 45 days was 14.4.1990, but the High Court and its office were closed for holidays on 14th and 15th April, 1990 and reopened only on 16.4.1990. If Section 10 of the General Clauses Act applies, then the election petition filed on 16.4.1990 was within time. We have already held in the connected Civil Appeal No. 4973 of 1993 - Manohar Joshi vs. Nitin Bhaurao Patil & Anr. - decided today, that Section 10 of the General Clauses Act applies to an election petition. It must, therefore, be held that this election petition was filed within time. This argument on behalf of the appellant is, therefore, rejected. Meaning and Effect of Sections 98 and 99 of the R.P. Act, 1951. The next question for consideration is the legality of deciding the election petition and declaring the election of the returned candidate to be void by making an order under Section 98 of the R.P. Act, and then proceeding to issue notice under Section 99 to the aforesaid five persons on the basis of speeches alleged to have been made by them on 29.1.1990 and 24.2.1990 which form the basis of the ground under Section 100(1)(b) for declaring the election to be void. The question really is: Whether notice under Section 99 of the R.P. Act can be issued for commission of a corrupt practice, after making an order deciding the election petition and declaring the election of the returned candidate to be void? This specific objection taken by the notices has been rejected by Variava, J. The legality of this view arises for consideration. As for the speeches alleged to have been made on 29.1.1990, it may be stated at the outset that they have to be excluded from consideration since they cannot form the basis of any corrupt practice at the election, inasmuch as they relate to a period prior to the date on which Ramakant Mayekar became a candidate at the election as defined in Section 79(b) of the R.P. Act. This is the settled position in law. [See Subhash Desai vs. Sharad J. Rao and Others, 1994 Supp. (2) SCC 446; Indira Nehru Gandhi vs. Raj Narain, 1975 Supp. SCC 1; Mohan Rawale vs. Damodar Tatyaba, 1994 (2) SCC 392]. This was the undisputed position at the hearing of these appeals before us since the speeches mad eon 29.1.1990 were prior to the date on which Ramakant Mayekar became a candidate at the election. It follows necessarily that the impugned judgment as well as the subsequent notices issued under Section 99 of the R.P. Act, are unsustainable to the  Page 7 of 14 extent they are based on the speeches alleged to have been made on 29.1.1990. No further discussion is necessary for holding that part of the impugned judgment dated 5th/6th August, 1991, notices under Section 99 of the R.P. Act and the subsequent order dated 6th January, 1992 as contrary to law and, therefore, liable to be set aside for this reason alone. It is only the surviving part of the impugned judgment and the notices which require further consideration, for which purpose the question for decision at the threshold is the validity of the course adopted of deciding the election petition and declaring the election of the returned candidate to be void and then proceeding to give notices for taking action under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. We have already indicated the combined effect of Sections 98 and 99 of the R.P. Act in the connected Civil Appeal No. 4973 of 1993 - Manohar Joshi vs. Nitin Bhaurao Patil & Anr. - decided today. The correct legal position has been overlooked by the High Court. The High Court appears to have misread the decision of this Court in D.P. Mishra vs. Kamal Narayan Sharma and Anr., 1971 (1) SCR 8, to form the opinion that the course adopted by it was permissible under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. The question in that case was of the failure to issue notice under Section 99 of the R.P. Act to a person alleged to have committed the corrupt practice for which the returned candidate also was guilty. The High Court, in the appeal, did not comply with the requirement of Section 99 for avoiding further delay. This Court rejected that view as incorrect and held as under : ""We are unable to agree with the view so propounded by the High Court. Under s. 99 of the Act the Court has no discretion in the matter, if the Court was of the view that any person who is proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt practice, not to name that person. It is true that preliminary objections were argued at an earlier stage, but Sharma could not before the appeal was heard ask the Court to issue a notice under s. 99 of the Act on the footing that his case which was rejected by the Tribunal will be accepted. The duty under the Act is cast upon the Court or the Tribunal, and on the ground that the party has not applied for a notice, the High Court could not avoid the obligation imposed by statute to take proceeding under s. 99 against the person proved at the trial to have been guilty of corrupt practice and to name him. We fail also to appreciate the ground on which the High Court has referred to delay being an ""outweighing factor"". Shyamacharan Shukla was however not a party to the proceeding and before he could be named a notice must go to him under s. 99 of the Act. We direct that the proceeding be remanded to the High Court and the High Court do give notice to Shyamacharan Shukla under s. 99 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, to appear and to show cause why he should not be named  Page 8 of 14 for committing corrupt practices. If Shyamacharan Shukla appears in pursuance of the show cause notice he will be entitled to an opportunity of cross examining witnesses who have already been examined by the Tribunal and has given evidence against him and he will be entitled to give evidence in his defence and of being heard..... (at pages 29-30) There is nothing in this decision to support the view taken by the High Court that it could decide the election petition and make an order under Section 98 declaring the election of the returned candidate to be void and then proceed under Section 99 of the R.P. Act against the other persons. It is, therefore, clear that the impugned judgment dated 5th/6th August, 1991 declaring the appellant’s election to be void and the subsequent order dated 6.1.1992 rejecting the preliminary objections to the notice issued subsequently under Section 99, both by Variava, J., are contrary to law and have to be set aside. We have not to determine the nature of the final order to be made. Speeches We have already indicated that the speeches alleged to have been made on 29.1.1990 are irrelevant and have to be excluded from consideration as earlier stated. In respect of the speeches alleged to have been made on 24.2.1990, the relevant portions of the impugned judgment are as under : ""The question then is whether the Respondent was also present at the meeting held on 24th February 1990. Here again the petitioner has admitted that her only source of knowledge are newspaper reports. In this case however, not a single newspaper report support the case that all 34 candidates were present or that the Respondent was present....... Thus the only evidence of Respondent’s presence at this meeting is this photo. The court has looked at the photo and the Respondent a number of times. It is not possible to categorically state that this is the photo of the Respondent. If that be so, then the benefit of doubt must be given to the Respondent. Thus, there is no evidence before this court to show that the Respondent was present at the meeting held on 24th February 1990. If that be so, then the question of considering the Respondent’s case, why he was not present at this meeting does not arise at all. It was for the petitioner to satisfy the court that the Respondent was present at this meeting. The petitioner has failed to do that. Therefore, so far as the meeting of 24th February, 1990 is concerned, it is not possible to hold that the Respondent was present at that meeting."" (emphasis supplied) The above finding relating to speeches by some persons other than the appellant can have relevance only if the element of appellant’s consent is also pleaded and proved. The  Page 9 of 14 appellant’s consent was attempted to be made out by implication only from the fact of his personal presence when those speeches were made. However, the above conclusion reached by the High Court shows that the appellant’s presence at the meeting was not found to be proved. This being so, the element of candidate’s consent which is a constituent part of the corrupt practice alleged on the basis of speeches made on 24.2.1990 by some other persons has not been found proved. That finding alone is sufficient to reject the allegation of corrupt practice on the basis of speeches made by others on 24.2.1990, as not proved. When this is the conclusion reached in respect of the appellant himself with regard to the allegation of corrupt practice based on speeches made by others on 24.2.1990, then the question of recording a finding that the corrupt practice has been proved, does not arise and, therefore, the further question of naming any other person who could have been proved at the trial to be guilty of the corrupt practice under Section 99 of the R.P. Act does not arise. The pleading in respect of speeches made in the public meeting held at Shivaji Park, Dadar on 24.2.1990 is in paras 22, 23 and generally in para 27 of the election petition. These are the only portions of the election petition on which reliance is placed by learned counsel for the respondent as the pleading on this point. It is pleaded in para 22 that the speeches were made by Bal Thackeray and other leaders of the alliance in that meeting where the present appellant (respondent in the election petition) and all other candidates of Shiv Sena - BJP alliance were present. Thereafter, in paras 23 and 27, there is only a general averment that the appeal made by Bal Thackeray and other leaders to the voters was with the consent of the appellant (respondent in the election petition). No fact other than the averment of personal presence of the appellant was pleaded to make out the consent of the appellant required for constituting the corrupt practice. As earlier indicated, the High Court has held that the presence of the appellant at that meeting has not been proved. Thus, the only basis for pleading and attempting to prove the appellant’s consent to the making of those speeches in the meeting held on 24.2.1990 has been held to be not proved. There is thus no foundation even for a tentative finding of any corrupt practice on the basis of speeches alleged to have been made by Bal Thackeray and some other leaders in this case against the present appellant, inasmuch as a necessary ingredient of the corrupt practice, i.e., consent of the appellant has been found to be not proved. There being not even a tentative basis to hold the charge of this corrupt practice proved against the appellant, the further question of invoking Section 99 to name any other person for the commission of that corrupt practice along with the returned candidate does not arise. In short, the finding of corrupt practice against the appellant on the basis of speeches alleged to have been made by some leaders in the meeting of 24.2.1990 being unsustainable, this charge has to fail and no occasion arises in the present case for taking any action under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. This part of the impugned judgment as well as the remaining part of the notices under Section 99 of the R.P. Act also have to be set aside. The only surviving question now is whether the impugned judgment, to the extent it survives against the appellant on the basis of wall paintings and video cassettes can be sustained. Wall Paintings   14 After the above conclusion reached in respect of the speeches alleged to have been made by some leaders on 29.1.1990 and 24.2.1990 for the reasons already given, the only remaining findings of corrupt practice recorded by the High Court are based on certain wall paintings and video cassette which have been found to constitute the corrupt practices under Section 123(3) and 123(3A) of the R.P. Act. We would now examine these findings on merits. The pleading relating to the allegation of corrupt practice based on wall paintings is contained in para 21 of the election petition which is as under : ""The petitioner states that the respondent and his agents with the consent of the respondent have also used posters, banners and wall paintings canvassing to vote for the respondent, appealing the voters to vote for the respondent in the name of Hindu religion. The petitioner has got the photographs taken of such wall paintings. The petitioner craves leave to refer to and rely upon the said photographs as and when produced."" (emphasis supplied) Except for repeating the words of the statute prescribing the corrupt practice, there is no pleading of the material facts or any particulars necessary to constitute the corrupt practice as required by Section 83(1) of the R.P. Act. Reference is made to certain photographs of the alleged wall paintings and it has been said that the photographs would be relied on as and when produced. The contents or form of the wall paintings or their photographs has not been pleaded and the photographs referred in para 21 of the election petition were neither annexed to the election petition nor copy thereof furnished to the returned candidate along with a copy of the petition. Thus, there is no pleading in the election petition of the language or contents of the wall paintings which were alleged to constitute the corrupt practice of canvassing for votes in the name of Hindu religion. If the mere mention of photographs without indicating its contents in the election petition is to be construed as incorporation of its contents by reference in the election petition, then non-supply of the copy of the photographs with the copy of the election petition would result in non compliance of Section 81(3). However, since the photographs were not annexed to the election petition, it is a case not of non-compliance of Section 81(3) but a case of total absence of any pleading in the election petition of the corrupt practice on the basis of wall paintings. Therefore, the pleading being wholly deficient in material facts necessary to constitute the cause of action, it was insufficient to raise a triable issue on that basis. In fact, this part of the pleading was liable to be struck out since it was irrelevant at the trial for the reason stated. It is clear that any evidence adduced later, in the absence of the requisite pleading of this corrupt practice was irrelevant and inadmissible and should not have been recorded and having been recorded must be excluded from consideration. The finding of the High Court of any corrupt practice being proved on this basis is contrary to law, and has to be set aside for this reason alone. In view of the above conclusion in relation to the wall paintings, any further discussion of the finding recorded by Variava, J. on this question would be unnecessary but for   of 14 the serious grievance made to the mode of the trial. Since the finding reflects the common perception which influenced the trial and decision of the several election petitions in the High Court as mentioned in the impugned judgment, it becomes necessary to refer to the discussion on this point in the impugned judgment. As indicated earlier, no triable issue arose in the absence of proper pleadings relating to the corrupt practice alleged on the ground of wall paintings, much less an occasion for a finding adverse to the returned candidate on this point. Surprisingly, evidence was recorded of the alleged contents of the said wall paintings through production of certain photographs later at the trial. A description of what is seen in these photographs is given in the impugned judgment to indicate that they showed the saffron flag and election symbol of the Shiv Sena and sought votes for the Shiv Sena candidates. The judgment then refers to the English translation of the slogans therein which reads, as under : ""...... In order to remove the brokers of corruption, let us throw around the Gulal of Hindutva""..... ""the lady sits angrily in Delhi Court, save Maharashtra by electing Sena-BJP""....... ""Our determination is firm. Stamp on the Bow and Arrow"" and ""Keep Hindutva awake, elect the bow and arrow.""....... ""for the protection of fiery Hindutva the Shiv Sena BJP candidate......"" The judgement then proceeds to hold as under : ""...... There can be no doubt that the ""Hindutva"" in these wall-paintings is the same ""Hindutva"" contained in the video cassettes ""Awahan and Avhan"". They are therefore an appeal to vote for Shiv Sena BJP candidates viz. The Respondent for protection of that ""Hindutva"". As is set out hereafter an appeal in the name of ""Hindutva"" amounts to an appeal to vote for the Hindu candidates of Shiv Sena BJP on the ground of their religion and also amounts to the corrupt practice or creating enmity and hatred amongst different classes of citizens on the grounds of religion and community. These paintings on walls and pipelines therefore amount to having appealed to the voters to vote for the Respondent on the ground of his religion and also amount to the corrupt practice of creating enmity and hatred amongst different classes of citizens on the grounds of religion and community."" Thereafter, the discussion relates to the consent of the candidate which is unnecessary in view of the earlier conclusion. The tenor of the impugned judgment, particularly the above extract, leaves no doubt that the High Court was of the view that any appeal for votes wherein was made of ""Hindutva"" is by itself sufficient to amount to an appeal for votes for the Hindu candidates of Shiv Sena-BJP on the ground of their religion and is a corrupt practice or creates enmity and hatred amongst different classes of citizens on the grounds of religion and community. The above   of 14 extract from the decision itself is sufficient to indicate the erroneous perception in this behalf which is clearly contrary to law. The distinction between sub-section (3) and (3A) of Section 123 which are two different corrupt practices, was totally lost sight of, and obliterated. Moreover, the use of the word ""Hindutva"" in the abstract was understood by the High Court to amount to an appeal for votes on the ground of Hindu religion if the candidate happened to be a Hindu to constitute the corrupt practice under sub-section (3); and at the same time this alone without anything more has been held to also constitute the corrupt practice under sub-section (3A) of Section 123, totally obliterating the distinction between these two sub sections of Section 123 constituting two different corrupt practices. Unfortunately, this erroneous construction of the statute leading to the formation of a wrong perception, led the High Court to commit the several errors commencing with the treating of deficient pleadings to be sufficient to raise a triable issue of a corrupt practice. This extraordinary procedure, impermissible in law, led to reception of considerable irrelevant and inadmissible evidence for which no basis can be found in the election petition. In short, the trial of the election petition became a roving inquiry into the affairs of a political party when the only concern at the trial should have been the merit of the charge of corrupt practices attributed to the returned candidate at the election. Actions of the party were relevant only to the extent relatable to the returned candidate, in the manner pleaded in the election petition. Unfortunately, this crucial factor was overlooked by the High Court in the trial of the election petition. In the abstract, the meaning of the word ""Hindutva"" is not confined only to Hindu religion unrelated to Indian culture and heritage and it is the context and the manner of its use which determines its true meaning in a particular speech. The kind of use made of the word ""Hindutva"", the context and the composition of the audience to which the speech is addressed, are all significant. In the connected Civil Appeal No. 2453 of 1991 - Shri Suryakant Venkatrao Mahadik vs. Smt. Saroj Sandesh Naik (Bhosale) - decided today, we have indicated how the use of the word ""Hindutva"" in the context and in the circumstances in which it was used in that case amounted to an appeal for votes on the ground of Hindu religion for a Hindu candidate. As a proposition of law, it cannot be said that in the abstract, the mere use of the word ""Hindutva"" during an election campaign must necessarily mean an appeal on the ground of Hindu religion for a Hindu candidate. We have discussed this question at some length in the connected Civil Appeal No. 2835 of 1989 Bal Thackeray vs. Prabhakar K. Kunte and Ors. - (with Civil Appeal No. 2836 of 1989) decided today. It is unnecessary to reiterate the same herein. What is forbidden by law is an appeal by a candidate for votes on the ground of ‘his’ religion or promotion etc. of hatred or enmity between groups of people, and not the mere mention of religion. There can be no doubt that mention made of any religion in the context of secularism or for criticising the anti-secular stance of any political party or candidate cannot amount to a corrupt practice under sub section (3) or (3A) of Section 123. In other words it is a question of fact in each case and not a proposition of law as understood and enunciated by the High Court. The view taken by the High Court in the impugned judgment indicates a wrong perception based on a mis  Page 13 of 14 construction of sub-sections (3) and (3A) of Section 123, obliterating at the same time the distinction in the two corrupt practices defined in these two provisions. The finding of the High Court of proof of the corrupt practice based on wall paintings in also, therefore, set aside. Video Cassette The only surviving question now relates to the corrupt practice alleged on the basis of certain video cassettes. The pleading is in paras 15 to 18 of the election petition. There is a general averment that the alliance had taken out video cassettes for the purpose of its election campaign and that they were exhibited at various places in the constituency. It is alleged that the contents of the video cassettes amounted to appeal for votes in the name of Hindu religion and they tended to create enmity and hatred amongst the voters on the basis of caste, creed and religion. The only specific fact pleaded apart from the general averment, contained in para 18 is as under : ""..... Bal Thackeray also boasted that if any one is obstructing the Hindu religion, he will fix him. That they (Shiv Sena) will stop all offering of ""Namaz"" on roads and bring down the loudspeakers from the mosques. Bal Thackeray has gone to the extent of coaxing the voters to scream aloud that they will not tolerate any one coming into power with the help of Muslim votes."" It is significant that here also the pleadings are deficient and the only averment which may be treated as specific is the above extract attributing certain speech to Bal Thackeray of which also no particulars are given. The requisite pleading of the candidate’s consent for this act of Bal Thackeray to constitute a corrupt practice by the candidate (appellant) is not pleaded apart from the general pleading of consent elsewhere. This state of pleading relating even to the video cassettes, when the video cassettes or its transcript were not produced along with the election petition or its copy furnished with the copy of the election petition to the appellant, is a serious defect in the pleading which once again has been totally overlooked at the trial of this election petition. This again has resulted in raising an issue for which the requisite pleadings were not there and then admitting considerable evidence which is irrelevant and inadmissible. We have considered this question at length in the connected Civil Appeal No. 4973 of 1993 - Manohar Joshi vs. Nitin Bhaurao Patil & Anr. - decided today. For the same reasons, the entire issue relating to the corrupt practice based on the video cassettes has to be excluded from consideration. Even otherwise the only specific pleading on the point which is extracted above is insufficient to plead this corrupt practice against the appellant, howsoever reprehensible it may be in relation to the alleged conduct of Bal Thackeray. The more fact that Bal Thackeray was leader of Shiv Sena of which party the appellant was a candidate is by itself not sufficient to hold any candidate guilty of the corrupt practice on the basis of an act done by Bal Thackeray unless that liability can be fastened on the candidate on further proof that the act was done with the consent of the candidate or the display of that cassette was made with the candidate’s consent at the specified time and place etc. during his election campaign. All these  Page 14 of 14 material facts were required to be pleaded and proved, but, instead, they have been assumed and even the finding is not related to any such specific act. The requisite consent of the candidate cannot be assumed merely from the fact that the candidate belongs to the same political party of which the wrong doer was a leader since there can be no presumption in law that there is consent of every candidate of the political party for every act done by every acknowledged leader of that party. The corrupt practice for which a candidate can be held vicariously guilty for an act of any other person who is not his agent in whose favour general authority is presumed, must be pleaded and proved to be with the consent of the candidate. Obviously, it is so because the penal consequences resulting from the finding of a corrupt practice against the candidate are visited on the candidate including the setting aside of his election. The High Court assumed for the purpose of pleading as well as proof that no specific pleading or proof of consent of the candidate was necessary if the act was attributed to any leader or even a member of the same political party. The distinction between the ground in Section 100(1)(b) on which the election petition was allowed and that under Section 100(1)(d)(ii) was completely missed. Admittedly, the ground under Section 100(1)(d)(ii) is neither the basis of the election petition nor is it of the judgment of the High Court. It is this erroneous assumption made of the law as an abstract proposition, which has resulted in the several serious errors in the trial as well as in the impugned judgment. This discussion is sufficient to set aside the only remaining finding against the appellant. From the above discussion, it follows that the findings on all points against the appellant, of the corrupt practices held to be proved against the appellant, have to be set aside, and so also the impugned judgment dated 5th/6th August, 1991, resulting in dismissal of the election petition. The notices issued by the High Court under Section 99 of the R.P. Act to Chhagan Bhujbal, Bal Thackeray, Pramod Mahajan, Manohar Joshi and Pramod Navalkar after conclusion of the trial must also be quashed for the above reasons. The result of this decision is that the inquiry against Pramod Navalkar and Manohar Joshi pending in the High Court in this matter also terminates. The appeals are allowed. The appellant Ramakant Mayekar would get costs throughout from the respondent Smt. Celine D’Silva (election petitioner). The other parties will bear their own costs throughout"
71,,S. PRABH SINGH DHILLON ETC. ETC.,HOSHIARPUR IMPROVEMENT TRUST & ORS.,23/11/1995,"J.S. VERMA, K. VENKATASWAMI","JUDGMENT: O R D E R Substitution allowed. This Court while disposing of the matter by order dated July 20, 1988 directed that depending upon the decision of the Constitution Bench in Union of India vs. Raghubir Singh [(1989) 3 SCR 316], the payment of the interest and solatium would be determined. Since there the Constitution Bench had concluded that the claimants would be entitled to the statutory benefits under Amendments Act 60 of 1984 if the proceedings are pending before the Land Acquisition Officer or Civil Court between April 30, 1984, i.e., when the Amendment Act 68 of 1984 was introduced on the floor of the Parliament and the date when the Act came into force in September 24, 1984. Admittedly, the award came to be made on August 30, 1982 and the supplementary award with regard to the trees etc., came to be made on December 27, 1982.

This Court while disposing of the matter by order dated July 20, 1988 directed that depending upon the decision of the Constitution Bench in Union of India vs. Raghubir Singh [(1989) 3 SCR 316], the payment of the interest and solatium would be determined. Since there the Constitution Bench had concluded that the claimants would be entitled to the statutory benefits under Amendments Act 60 of 1984 if the proceedings are pending before the Land Acquisition Officer or Civil Court between April 30, 1984, i.e., when the Amendment Act 68 of 1984 was introduced on the floor of the Parliament and the date when the Act came into force in September 24, 1984. Admittedly, the award came to be made on August 30, 1982 and the supplementary award with regard to the trees etc., came to be made on December 27, 1982. Under these circumstances, the petitioners would be entitled to payment of solatium under Section 23 [2] @ 30% per annum on enhanced compensation.

MUKHERJEE. J. The seven appellants in these appeals and one Mahadev Prasad Pandey were placed on trial before the learned Additional Sossions Judge, Mathura. Against the appellants common charges under Sections 120-B. 148, 302/149. and 454 I.P.C. and against Mahadev Prasad Pandey charges under Sections 302/109 and 307/109 IPC were framed. A separate charge under Section 302 IPC was also framed against the appellant Anokhey Lal. On conclusion of the trial the learned Judge. while acouitting Mahadev Prasad, convicted all the appellants under Sections 148 and 324/149 IPC and further convicted Anokhey Lal under Section 302 IPC. For each of their convictions the appellants were sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for two years and Anokhey Lal was sentenced to imprisonment for life for his conviction under Section 302 IPC. The sentences were directed to run concurrently. Against the above judgment two appeals were filed; one by the appellants assailing their convictions and the other by the State against their acquittal of the other charges. The High Court dismissed both the appeals and affirmed the judgment of the High Court. Hence these appeals. According to the prosecution case on March 27, 1975 at or about 6.30 A.M. the appellants. armed with deadly weapons, raided the house of Gopal and appellant Anokhey Lal thrust a spear on the chest of Makhan, brother of Gopal, felling him down. On hearing the hue and cry raised by Makhan, Ram Dayal, Gopal and Ram Krishan came there and they were also attacked by the appellants by their respective weapons. Finding no other alternative. when Gopal started thowing brick-bats towards the appellants and Ram Dayal and Ram Krishan started beating them with small dandas they fled away. Makhan, who was seriously injured, was taken to police station along with the other injured by Giriraj. his elder   of 3 brother. and there he (Giriraj) gave a written report of the incident, on the basis of which a case was registered against the appellants. Since the condition of Makhan was grave he was immediately sent to Mathura Hospital while the other injured were sent to local Government dispensary. Makhan, however, did not respond to the medical treatment given to him at the hospital and succumbed to his injuries within an hour. The appellants pleaded not guilty to the charges levelled against them and took up the plea of right of private defence of their persons. To prove its case the prosecution examined a host of witnesses of whom Giriraj (P.W.1). Ram Krishan (P.W.2), Rameshwar Prasad (P.W.3), Puran Devi (P.W.4) and Ram Dayal (P.W.5) gave the ocular version of the incident. The appellants also examined a number of witnesses in support of their defence. On consideration of evidence adduced during trial the trial Court accepted the case of the prosecution in preference to that of the defence and held the appellants guilty. The High Court also in its turn. reappraised the evidence and upheld the order of the trial Court. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and considered the judgments of the learned Courts below in the light of the evidence adduced during trial we do not find any reason whatsoever to disturb the concurrent findings of fact recorded by them, more so, as they are based on detailed and proper discussion of the entire evidence and supported by cogent reasons. It was, however, strongly urged on behalf of the appellants that even if the entire prosecution case was accepted as true Anokhey Lal could only be, in view of fact that Makhan sustained only one injury, guilty of an offence under Section 304 (Part II) IPC and not under Section 302 IPC. As already noticed the prosecution case was that the appellant Anokhey lal had thrust a spear on the chest of Makhan. Dr. Jagdish Lal (P.W. 13) who held post-mortem examination on the dead body of Makhan found the following injury on his person: ""Incised would 1 1/2"" x 1/2"" x chest cavity deep of linear nature near the sternum bone on the front side below the chest."" He further stated that on internal examination he found the pericardium damaged and one ounce of blood present. According to P.W.13 the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death of Makhan and that the same could be caused by a spear. When considered in the context of the proved facts that the appellants had gone armed with deadly weapons, to attack the members of Gopal’s family and after trespassing into the house Anokhey Lal caused a penetrating injury on a vital part of the body of Makhan with a spear which was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the conclusion is inevitable that the offence committed by Anokhey Lal comes within clause III of Section 300 IPC so as to make Anokhey Lal liable for conviction under Section 302 IPC. As regards the other six appellants, whose convictions are to be upheld, we do not feel inclined to send them behind the bars again as more than twenty years have elapsd since the offences were committed by them and each of them has served a substantial part of their sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment. For the foregoing discussion we uphold the convictions  Page 3 of 3 and sentence recorded against the appellant Anokhey lal and the convictions of the other six appellants put we reduce their sentence to the period already undergone. As all the appellants are on bail. Anokhey Lal will now surrender to his bail bond to serve out the sentence imposed upon him, while the other six appellants will stand discharged from their respective bail bonds.

(J),"JUDGMENT: O R D E R This appeal is directed against the judgment of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Allahabad (the tribunal) dated July 18, 1990 upholding the order of the president of India under Rule 9 of the Central Civil Service (Pension) Rules, 1972 (the Pension Rules) withholding the entire monthly pension admissible to the appellant and also denying the death-cum-retirement gratuity to which the appellant may be entitled under the rules. The appellant, Sita Ram Yadava, was working as a Sorter in the Railway Mail Service at Kanpur. He was absent from duty from October 11, 1973 to July 30, 1974. In the night between October 20/21, 1973, 70 gms of illicit opium was recovered from Sita Ram Yadava who at that time stated that he was the son of Bhagwati Prasad. He was arrested by the Excise Inspector under the Opium Act. According to the respondents the arrested person was none other than the appellant who according to the railway record is son of Jhullan Prasad. Sita Ram Yadava was convicted under Section 9 of the Opium Act and was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months. Appeal filed by him was dismissed by the Sessions Judge. Criminal Revision filed by Yadava was dismissed by the Jabalpur Bench of the Madha Pradesh High Court on February 28, 1975. Disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the appellant and as a consequence he was dismissed from service by the order dated December 21, 1974 under Rule 19(i) of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965 (the Rules). The appellant preferred appeal which was allowed with a direction to the disciplinary authority to hold an inquiry under Rule 19 of the Rules. Since the case of the appellant before the disciplinary authority was that Sita Ram Yadava who was convicted under the Opium Act was a different person than the appellant, the appellate authority further directed that the disciplinary   of 4 authority should properly investigate into the identity of the petitioner/convict and thereafter pass final order in the matter. The disciplinary authority as a result of the inquiry passed the order dated June 11, 1984 dismissing the appellant from service. A finding was recorded that the appellant was the same person who had been convicted by the criminal court under the Opium Act. The appellant preferred appeal against the order dated June 11, 1984 and once again the appellate authority allowed the appeal and directed the disciplinary authority to give further hearing to the appellant. It was also directed that opportunity to cross-examine the hand-writing expert should also be given. Before the departmental inquiry could be completed, the appellant retired from service on March 31, 1985. The inquiry was, thereafter, converted into one under the Pension Rules. The disciplinary authority finally recorded the finding that it was the appellant who was convicted under the Opium Act. The proceedings were forwarded to the President of India for final orders. The President proposed the provisional punishment of withholding the petitioner’s pension permanently and not disbursing death-cum-retirement gratuity to him. Accordingly, a show cause notice dated August 23, 1985 was issued to the appellant and he submitted his reply. The Union public Service Commission was consulted which approved the proposed punishment. Finally the President passed the order of punishment on May 5, 1987. The Tribunal in the impugned judgment held as under: ""We do not think, therefore, that there is any doubt in the authenticity of the court papers whose negatives were made over to its Expert. So far as the photographs from the Service Book and taking of specimen signatures and thumb impressions by the Expert himself on 19.1.1984 is concerned, there is no reason to doubt their genuineness. All these papers, according to the report of the Expert, were obtained from the office of the Senior Superintendent of Post Offices/the disciplinary authority. The papers, therefore, came from a proper custody ...........There is no reason, therefore, to hold that the materials which were examined by the Expert were not reliable or appropriate materials for the purposes of determining the identity of the petitioner with the convict of the criminal case."" In the penultimate para of the judgment the Tribunal finally observed as under: ""These are all the points which have arisen in this case. We notice that not only the disciplinary authority appears to have considered all the relevant materials, but the case was also considered by the Union Public Service Commission, who submitted their recommendations dated 19.3.1987 (Annexure-14). A perusal of this document shows that the Commission considered at length the disciplinary proceedings including the appellate order requiring the investigation to be  Page 3 of 4 made to fix the petitioner’s identity. After the Inquiring officer’s report dated 25.9.1985, the reply dated 13-9-85 given by the petitioner is also the Commission. In para 5 of Annexure-14 it is said that the Commission have examined the records of the case carefully and saw no reason to differ from the findings of the Inquiring Officer arrived at on the basis of the totality of the evidence examined during during the enquiry and confirmed the view of the Inquiring Officer that the petitioner is the same person, who was convicted in the criminal case. Apparently the Commission has bestowed its attention to the controversy it is not a case of non-application of mind."" We see no ground to interfere with the findings of fact reached by the departmental authorities and upheld by the Tribunal. We agree with the reasoning and the conclusions reached by the Tribunal. This Court, while granting special leave, passed the following order : ""Special leave granted. By the Presidential order dated 5.5.1987, both pension and DCRG have been withheld. Counsel for the petitioner submitted that so far as gratuity is concerned, the matter stands covered by this Court’s decision in D.V. Kapur V. Union of India, 1990 (4) SCC 314. That case turned on the interpretation of Rule 9 of the Civil Services Conduct Rules, 1972. In paragraph 10 of the judgment after referring to the Rule, this Court pointed out that the right to gratuity being a statutory right could be taken away by a valid Rule only and since Rule 9 did not empower the withholding of gratuity and no other rule was pointed out which permitted the withholding of gratuity, the order withholding gratuity could not be sustained. We enquired of Mr. Tulsi, learned ASG, if he was in a position to point out any Rule which entitled the President to withhold DCRG. He was not able to do so. It, therefore, prima facie appears that the contention urged by counsel in regard to gratuity is well founded. We, therefore, by this interim order direct the release of DCRG to the petitioner on the petitioner giving an undertaking to this Court to refund the same in the event this Court so directs."" It is not necessary for us to go into the question whether death-cum-retirement, gratuity can be withheld under the Pension Rules. Since the said gratuity has already been paid to the appellant, we are of the view that it would be in the interest of justice to permit the appellant to retain the same. He shall, however, not be entitled to the pension. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No costs.","JUDGMENT: O R D E R This appeal is directed against the judgment of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Allahabad (the tribunal) dated July 18, 1990 upholding the order of the president of India under Rule 9 of the Central Civil Service (Pension) Rules, 1972 (the Pension Rules) withholding the entire monthly pension admissible to the appellant and also denying the death-cum-retirement gratuity to which the appellant may be entitled under the rules.

Counsel for the petitioner submitted that so far as gratuity is concerned, the matter stands covered by this Court’s decision in D.V. Kapur V. Union of India, 1990 (4) SCC 314. That case turned on the interpretation of Rule 9 of the Civil Services Conduct Rules, 1972. In paragraph 10 of the judgment after referring to the Rule, this Court pointed out that the right to gratuity being a statutory right could be taken away by a valid Rule only and since Rule 9 did not empower the withholding of gratuity and no other rule was pointed out which permitted the withholding of gratuity, the order withholding gratuity could not be sustained. We enquired of Mr. Tulsi, learned ASG, if he was in a position to point out any Rule which entitled the President to withhold DCRG. He was not able to do so. It, therefore, prima facie appears that the contention urged by counsel in regard to gratuity is well founded. We, therefore, by this interim order direct the release of DCRG to the petitioner on the petitioner giving an undertaking to this Court to refund the same in the event this Court so directs."" It is not necessary for us to go into the question whether death-cum-retirement, gratuity can be withheld under the Pension Rules. Since the said gratuity has already been paid to the appellant, we are of the view that it would be in the interest of justice to permit the appellant to retain the same. He shall, however, not be entitled to the pension. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No costs."

This appeal by special leave arises from the judgment dated November 10, 1993 of the Division Bench of the High Court passed in D.B. Spl. Appeal No.607 of 1991. The facts are not in dispute. The first respondent is an educational institution which made a request to the appellant for allotment of 15,000 sq. yards of land in Malviya Nagar Scheme. By proceedings dated August 12, 1988, the appellant had informed the respondents that it had fixed the reserved price at Rs.160/- per sq. meter for schools. Clause 5 says that the lease money can be changed after 15 years but it will not exceed 25% of the reserved price. Clause 15 of the offer envisages that on non-payment of the demanded amount within one month, the appellant will be entitled to realize interest and cancel the allotment. In case of acceptance, Clause 16 sub-clause [ii] provides that ""if you accept the allotment of the above conditions, please deposit the amount within one month as under"". The details of the amount have been mentioned and the total amount to be deposited was Rs.20,31,820.90. Admittedly, the respondents had deposited only one lakh. Thereafter, the Secretary to the appellant had communicated through a letter that the State Government had granted permission for allotment of the land at 25% of the reserved price to the respondent-Academy by letter dated August 12, 1988 and that is being returned. Then on January 12, 1990, pursuant to a letter written by the respondents on July 6, 1989, they also reiterated that they were willing to allot the land @ 25% of the then prevailing reserved price of the land and the amount mentioned thereunder has been specified. It was also stated expressly thus: ""Please see that the cost of the land is deposited in favour of the Secretary, J.D.A., Jaipur, within 30   of 3 days from the date of issue of this letter failing which the offer stands cancelled."" The allotment order dated August 12, 1988 was thereafter cancelled. Thus the previous allotment stood cancelled and fresh offer was made subject to the respondents depositing the amount stated thereunder within 30 days from the date of issue of the letter. Admittedly, the amount was not deposited, except writing a letter that the Rajasthan Urban Improvement Trust [Disposal of Urban Land] Rules, 1974 envisage that 50% of the prevailing reserved price was to be paid and the appellant’s demand was illegal. Rule which has been relied upon reads thus: ""No land shall be allotted for a price less than the sanctioned reserved price except for categories covered under Rule 17."" Rule 17 provides as under: ""Lands for schools and other public and charitable institutions may be allotted on payment of 50% of the sanctioned reserved price or with the prior permission of the State Government free of any charge or at concessional rates."" It would thus be seen that it may be incumbent upon the appellant to allot the land but in case they choose to allot, they may allot on payment of 50% of the sanctioned reserved price. It would be seen that in the first offer, the appellant had offered land @ Rs.160/- per sq. meter as reserved price and the respondents had not complied with the same. As stated earlier, the offer stood cancelled. In 1990, when a second offer was made, even then also, it was not complied with. The respondents have relied upon the circular issued by the Government amplifying as to under what circumstances allotment may be made at a lesser price. The circular dated October 13, 1987 is only guidelines for disposal of the lands for educational, religious, charitable or public institutions at concessional rate of 25% as the reserved price, but the instructions were to ensure uniformity in the allotment and charging the rates. The offer had been given charging @ Rs.160/- per sq. meter in the first instance and the respondents had not paid the amount except Rs.1 lakh. Had they paid the amount at reserved price and claimed refund at 50% or 25%, as the case may, as per their own case, something could be said in their favour. But unfortunately they did not accept the offer which was conditional. They had chosen to deposit only Rs.1 lakh as against Rs.21 lakhs. As stated earlier, the cancellation order was not challenged. When a fresh offer was made then also the respondents had not complied with the offer; instead they went to the court for a direction to give them allotment at concessional rate of 25% of original value at Rs.160 per sq. meter. The Division Bench had thus erroneously directed the allotment on payment of 25% of Rs.160/- per sq. yard, which offer was no longer subsisting, since it was already cancelled. Under these circumstances, the order of the High Court is clearly illegal. The appeal is accordingly allowed. The writ petition stands dismissed. No costs","JUDGMENT: O R D E R Leave granted.

(J)","JUDGMENT: O R D E R This appeal by special leave arises against the judgment and decree dated August 4, 1981 of the Gauhati High Court at Guwahati made in S.A. No. 17/76. The appellants plaintiffs filed the suit for declaration of title that the lands in Chaibari Village which were part of Machpara Estate were given to Dayamoyee Devi, daughter of Rai Bahadur Prithiram Chowdhury, the holder of the said estate as dowry at the time of her marriage and that she and thereafter her successors including the plaintiffs had been in possession and enjoyment of the lands in their own right. The lands therein did not stand vested in the State of Assam under the Assam State Acquisition of the Zamindaries Act, 1951. The trial court decreed the suit. But on appeal, the District Judge reversed the decree and held that the appellants had failed to prove that the appellants possessed the lands in their own right and that it was not vested in the State. Accordingly, the suit was dismissed. In second appeal, while upholding the findings of the appellate Court, the learned Single Judge of the High Court held that if the compensation for the lands comprised in Chaibari Village were not paid, a conditional decree was passed directing the State to pay the compensation in respect thereof to the appellants. Thus this appeal by special leave. Shri S.K. Nandy, learned counsel for the appellants, has contended that since the lands had passed on from the Zamindar to his daughter as dowry, she became the absolute owner of the property. The State had not proved that they had acquired the land under the Act and that compensation was paid to them. Thereby the lands did not vest in the State. The High Court, therefore, was not right in holding that the title of the land in favour of the appellants stood extinguished under the Act. We find no force in the contention. The High Court has gone into the question of adverse possession pleaded by the appellants and held that the   of 2 adverse possession is an encumbrance under the State Revenue Act and it does not bind the State. Therefore, as against the State, the appellant had not perfected her title by adverse possession. It was also held that since the appellants had asserted title to the property, burden is on the appellants to establish that they had title to the plaint schedule lands and continued to have title thereto. Since they failed to establish the title, the appellants cannot be held to be the owners of the land. High Court called upon the Government to produce certain notifications. Since they were not produced, the High Court had expressed its displeasure for the lethargy on the part of the officials of the Government but that was not conclusive. The ultimate finding is that the appellants had not proved their title to the lands and they did not form part of the acquisition under the Act. They did not remain as owners of the lands and the lands stood vested in the State. These conclusions reached by the High Court are not vitiated by any manifest error of law warranting interference. However, the High Court had granted conditional decree, namely, the payment of the compensation, if not already paid. It is, therefore, for the appellants to make an application to the appropriate authority seeking payment, if not already received, and the competent authority would consider and dispose of the matter within three months from the date of making the application for payment of compensation, if not already paid.

Venkataswami JUDGMENT J.S. VERMA, J. Leave granted. These appeals by special leave are by the State of Assam and arise out of unusual circumstances involving three senior officers of the Government of Assam, namely, the Chief Secretary H.N. Das, Additional Chief Secretary P.C. Mishra and Commissioner (Home) C.K. Das. At the hearing before us Shri Kapil Sibal, learned counsel for the State of Assam submitted that it was agreed by all concerned that the adverse remarks made by the Tribunal in the impugned order against Shri H.N. Das should be expunged and, therefore, the State Government does not press these appeals on merits even though it does not accept the correctness of the Tribunal’s order. All the other counsel appearing for the different parties in these appeals supported the submission of Shri sibal and a common prayer was made to dispose of these appeals in these terms. Ordinarily, in view of the common stand taken at the hearing of these appeals it may not have been necessary to say anything more. However, in view of the distressing facts and circumstances which have given rise to these appeals, we consider it necessary to state briefly the relevant facts and express out views which we consider expedient with the hope that it prevents such situations in future at any level of the administration, mush less at the highest level.   of 4 Shri P.C. Mishra was posted as the Chairman of the Assam Board of Revenue at the relevant time. By the orders dated 10/10/1991 and 8/9/1992 of the Department of Personnel (A) in the Government of Assam, the displeasure of the Government was conveyed to Shri P.C. Mishra for conduct. Shri P.C. Mishra filed O.A. No.211 of 1992 for quashing the said orders and the O.A. has been allowed by the impugned order dated 1/8/1994 quashing the orders dated 10/10/1991 and 8/9/1992 made by the Government of Assam. While making this order, the Tribunal has made certain adverse remarks against Shri H.N. Das, who was then the Chief Secretary of the State. These appeals by special leave are by the State Government against the Tribunal’s order. As earlier stated, these appeals are not pressed on merits and, therefore, the State Government’s orders conveying displeasure against Shri P.C. Mishra having been quashed, no grievance survives to Shri P.C. Mishra. In the process of quashing the Government orders against Shri P.C. Mishra, the Tribunal has made certain adverse remarks against Sh. H.N. Das which, it is common ground, now should be expunged. On the expunging of the adverse remarks against Shri P.C. Mishra would survive without the adverse remarks against Shri H.N. Das. The material facts giving rise to this unfortunate situation are a few. In November 1990 Shri H.N. Das was the Chief Secretary of the State and Shri P.C. Mishra was the only officer in the rank of Additional Chief Secretary of the State. On 8/11/1990 Shri H.N. Das, Chief Secretary, submitted a note to the Chief Minister, stating that he wished to proceed on leave immediately, for which he sought approval. The entire note (at pages 42-43- of the paper book) is as follows : ""CHIEF MINISTER. I wish to proceed on leave immediately. Formal application will be submitted separately. This may kindly be approved and alternative arrangement ordered. sd/- H.N.Das 8/11/1990, C.S. Additional Chief Secretary will be incharge of Chief Secretary until further orders. Sd/- P.K. Mohanta 8/11/1990 C.S. has not specified the nature of leave or duration, It would be difficult to issue any orders on the basis of the above. Please explain this to C.S. in person. Sd/-S.K. Tewari 9/11/1990 Commissioner Personnel I wish to apply for Casual leave for two days on 9/11/1990 and 10/11/1990 and necessary orders may please by issued. C.M. has already agreed. Sd/- H.N. Das 9/11/1990. Thus it was clarified by Shri H.N. Das that his request was only for two days casual leave on 9/11/1990 and 10/11/1990. The Chief Minister on the same day made an order directing the Additional Chief Secretary to be in charge of the office of Chief Secretary until further orders. On 10/11/1990 the Chief Minister made an order addressed to Shri P.C. Mishra directing him to take over charge as Chief  Page 3 of 4 Secretary until further orders and to issue notifications promoting Shri P.C. Sharma, Shri S. Manoharan, Shri C.K. Das and Shri A.C. Changakati all I.A.S. Officers, to the super time scales, for which orders in the relevant file had already been sent to the Personnel Department. Government Notification dated 11/11/1990 was issued posting Shri P.C. Mishra as Chief Secretary and he claimed to have taken charge of the office of Chief Secretary at 3 p.m. on 12/11/1990. On 12/11/1990, made a complaint to the Chief Secretary Shri H.N. Das against Shri P.C. Mishra. On the same day Shri H.N. Das as Chief Secretary sent to Shri P.C. Mishra the complaint of Smt. Sablok to clarify the position addressing Shri P.C. Mishra did not make any comment or give clarification to Shri H.N. Das treating himself to be the Chief Secretary on that day. An order dated 28/11/1990 was then issued by the State Government notifying the appointment of Shri H.N. Das as Chief Secretary. On 10/10/1991 the State Government issued an order conveying its displeasure to Shri P.C. Mishra for his indecorous and uncalled for behaviour with the junior lady officer. Shri P.C. Mishra made his protest against the same. However, the State Government by its order dated 8/9/1992 confirmed its earlier order dated 10/10/1991 conveying the State Government’s displeasure at the conduct of Shri P.C. Mishra. It is this unseemly incident which led to the controversy about the exact status of Shri P.C. Mishra on 12/11/1990 because of his claim to have assumed charge of the office of Chief Secretary on that day and it culminated in the State Government’s order conveying its displeasure at the behaviour of Shri P.C. Mishra. The O.A. was then filed in the Tribunal by Shri P.C. Mishra to quash the State Government’s orders dated 10/10/1991 and 8/9/1992. It is unnecessary, in view of the stand now taken by the State Government in its appeals before us to adjudicate on the exact status of Shri P.C. Mishra on 12/11/1990 and to pronounce on his claim that he was the Chief Secretary on 12/11/1990. However, it does appear to us that the mode of functioning of the State Government which led to rival claims by Shri P.C. Mishra and Shri H.N. Das of holding the office of Chief secretary on 12/11/1990, leaves much to be desired. It does appear that the situation resulted from certain ambiguous orders made by the State Government on the request of Shri H.N. Das on 8//11/1990 to proceed on leave in spite his clarification on 9/11/1990 of going only on two days casual leave. At any r ate some confusion having arisen son thereafter on 12/11/1990 on the stand taken by Smt. Sablok, Joint Secretary, Department of Personnel and Shri H.N. Das having purported to exercise the authority of Chief Secretary on the same day, it was essential for the State Government to have clarified the position immediately to avoid any escalation of that conflict which in turn jeopardised proper functioning of the State Administration. Unfortunately, this was not done. Even later the ad verse effect of this omission and its contribution to escalation of the controversy, was not realised when the matter proceeded further. It is even more unfortunate that some of the senior most officers of the Indian Administrative Service at the helm of administration in the state, did not realise the implications of their actions which resulted from a clash of egos and percolated to the lower levels of administration. It is incumbent for each occupant of every high office to be constantly aware that the power invested in the high office he holds is meant to be exercised in public interest  Page 4 of 4 and only for public good, and that it is not meant to be used for any personal benefit or merely to elevate the personal status of the current holder of that office. Constant awareness of the nature of this power and the purpose for which it is meant would prevent situations leading to clash of egos and the resultant fall out detrimental to public interest. It appears that this lack of perception in all concerned coupled with the failure of the State Government to issue clear orders, precipitated the situation into the unseemly controversy in the present case which must have adversely affected the State Administration. We do hope this incident serves as a warning for the future. We are constrained to make these observations Since they are necessary in the context and there is increase in the frequency of such occurrences every where. For the aforesaid reasons, we expunge all the adverse remarks contained in the impugned order of the Tribunal against Shri H.N. Das, the then Chief Secretary.

No.211 of 1992 for quashing the said orders and the O.A. has been allowed by the impugned order dated 1/8/1994 quashing the orders dated 10/10/1991 and 8/9/1992 made by the Government of Assam. While making this order, the Tribunal has made certain adverse remarks against Shri H.N. Das, who was then the Chief Secretary of the State. These appeals by special leave are by the State Government against the Tribunal’s order. As earlier stated, these appeals are not pressed on merits and, therefore, the State Government’s orders conveying displeasure against Shri P.C. Mishra having been quashed, no grievance survives to Shri P.C. Mishra. In the process of quashing the Government orders against Shri P.C. Mishra, the Tribunal has made certain adverse remarks against Sh. H.N. Das which, it is common ground, now should be expunged. On the expunging of the adverse remarks against Shri P.C. Mishra would survive without the adverse remarks against Shri H.N. Das. The material facts giving rise to this unfortunate situation are a few. In November 1990 Shri H.N. Das was the Chief Secretary of the State and Shri P.C. Mishra was the only officer in the rank of Additional Chief Secretary of the State. On 8/11/1990 Shri H.N. Das, Chief Secretary, submitted a note to the Chief Minister, stating that he wished to proceed on leave immediately, for which he sought approval. The entire note (at pages 42-43- of the paper book) is as follows : ""CHIEF MINISTER. I wish to proceed on leave immediately. Formal application will be submitted separately. This may kindly be approved and alternative arrangement ordered. sd/- H.N.Das 8/11/1990, C.S. Additional Chief Secretary will be incharge of Chief Secretary until further orders. Sd/- P.K. Mohanta 8/11/1990 C.S. has not specified the nature of leave or duration, It would be difficult to issue any orders on the basis of the above. Please explain this to C.S. in person. Sd/-S.K. Tewari 9/11/1990 Commissioner Personnel I wish to apply for Casual leave for two days on 9/11/1990 and 10/11/1990 and necessary orders may please by issued. C.M. has already agreed. Sd/- H.N. Das 9/11/1990. Thus it was clarified by Shri H.N. Das that his request was only for two days casual leave on 9/11/1990 and 10/11/1990. The Chief Minister on the same day made an order directing the Additional Chief Secretary to be in charge of the office of Chief Secretary until further orders. On 10/11/1990 the Chief Minister made an order addressed to Shri P.C. Mishra directing him to take over charge as Chief  Page 3 of 4 Secretary until further orders and to issue notifications promoting Shri P.C. Sharma, Shri S. Manoharan, Shri C.K. Das and Shri A.C. Changakati all I.A.S. Officers, to the super time scales, for which orders in the relevant file had already been sent to the Personnel Department. Government Notification dated 11/11/1990 was issued posting Shri P.C. Mishra as Chief Secretary and he claimed to have taken charge of the office of Chief Secretary at 3 p.m. on 12/11/1990. On 12/11/1990, made a complaint to the Chief Secretary Shri H.N. Das against Shri P.C. Mishra. On the same day Shri H.N. Das as Chief Secretary sent to Shri P.C. Mishra the complaint of Smt. Sablok to clarify the position addressing Shri P.C. Mishra did not make any comment or give clarification to Shri H.N. Das treating himself to be the Chief Secretary on that day. An order dated 28/11/1990 was then issued by the State Government notifying the appointment of Shri H.N. Das as Chief Secretary. On 10/10/1991 the State Government issued an order conveying its displeasure to Shri P.C. Mishra for his indecorous and uncalled for behaviour with the junior lady officer. Shri P.C. Mishra made his protest against the same. However, the State Government by its order dated 8/9/1992 confirmed its earlier order dated 10/10/1991 conveying the State Government’s displeasure at the conduct of Shri P.C. Mishra. It is this unseemly incident which led to the controversy about the exact status of Shri P.C. Mishra on 12/11/1990 because of his claim to have assumed charge of the office of Chief Secretary on that day and it culminated in the State Government’s order conveying its displeasure at the behaviour of Shri P.C. Mishra. The O.A. was then filed in the Tribunal by Shri P.C. Mishra to quash the State Government’s orders dated 10/10/1991 and 8/9/1992. It is unnecessary, in view of the stand now taken by the State Government in its appeals before us to adjudicate on the exact status of Shri P.C. Mishra on 12/11/1990 and to pronounce on his claim that he was the Chief Secretary on 12/11/1990. However, it does appear to us that the mode of functioning of the State Government which led to rival claims by Shri P.C. Mishra and Shri H.N. Das of holding the office of Chief secretary on 12/11/1990, leaves much to be desired. It does appear that the situation resulted from certain ambiguous orders made by the State Government on the request of Shri H.N. Das on 8//11/1990 to proceed on leave in spite his clarification on 9/11/1990 of going only on two days casual leave. At any r ate some confusion having arisen son thereafter on 12/11/1990 on the stand taken by Smt. Sablok, Joint Secretary, Department of Personnel and Shri H.N. Das having purported to exercise the authority of Chief Secretary on the same day, it was essential for the State Government to have clarified the position immediately to avoid any escalation of that conflict which in turn jeopardised proper functioning of the State Administration. Unfortunately, this was not done. Even later the ad verse effect of this omission and its contribution to escalation of the controversy, was not realised when the matter proceeded further. It is even more unfortunate that some of the senior most officers of the Indian Administrative Service at the helm of administration in the state, did not realise the implications of their actions which resulted from a clash of egos and percolated to the lower levels of administration. It is incumbent for each occupant of every high office to be constantly aware that the power invested in the high office he holds is meant to be exercised in public interest  Page 4 of 4 and only for public good, and that it is not meant to be used for any personal benefit or merely to elevate the personal status of the current holder of that office. Constant awareness of the nature of this power and the purpose for which it is meant would prevent situations leading to clash of egos and the resultant fall out detrimental to public interest. It appears that this lack of perception in all concerned coupled with the failure of the State Government to issue clear orders, precipitated the situation into the unseemly controversy in the present case which must have adversely affected the State Administration. We do hope this incident serves as a warning for the future. We are constrained to make these observations Since they are necessary in the context and there is increase in the frequency of such occurrences every where. For the aforesaid reasons, we expunge all the adverse remarks contained in the impugned order of the Tribunal against Shri H.N. Das, the then Chief Secretary. The Tribunal’s order would now remain with this modificatio"

Leave granted These two appeals are filed against the judgment and order dated 28.4.92 passed in Company Appeal No.1 of 1991 and the order dated 4.8.92 passed in Civil Review No.55 of 1992 by the High Court of Patna. The Maghadh Stock Exchange Association (hereinafter referred to as ‘MSEA’) is registered as a company under Section 25 of the Companies Act (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’). It is a company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital. Appellant, Narendera Kumar Agarwal, lodged with MSEA on 9th February, 1989 an instrument of transfer/nomination for transferring his interest as a member in the Company in favour of Respondent No.1, Smt. Saroj Maloo. On 10.8.89 she was informed by MSEA that transfer of membership by nomination in her favour was not possible in absence of any provision to that effect in its Articles of Association. Aggrieved by the refusal Smt. Saroj Maloo filed an appeal under Section 111 of the Act to the Company Law Board (hereinafter referred to as the Board). The stand taken by MSEA before the Board was that in the Articles of Association there was no provision regarding nomination of membership leading to transfer of the same in favour of nominee, prior to June 1989 and that in case of a company limited by guarantee without share capital like MSEA membership cannot be transferred by nomination until a clause providing for nomination is incorporated in its Articles of Association. It was also contended that a request for nomination could not have been received and considered till a provision in that behalf was incorporated in the Article 27A, the request to transfer could not be granted as it did not fulfil the requirements prescribed by that provision. The action of MSEA was also sought to be supported on the ground that Shri Narendera Kumar Agarwal   of 3 had subsequently cancelled his request contained in his made by a letter dated 6.2.89 to transfer his interest in favour of Smt. Saroj Maloo. The Board was of the view that if there is no provision for transfer of other interest in the Articles of Association of a company limited by guarantee and having no share capital then the member cannot transfer his interest to a third person. The Board held that in absence of such a provision and because Smt. Saroj Maloo failed to establish her case of proper lodgement of the transfer of other interest of the member as required by the amended Article 27A of the Articles of Association the action of MSEA was justified. It, therefore, dismissed her application. She preferred an appeal before the High Court of Patna against the said order passed by the Board. The High Court held that no distinction can be made between transfer of share of a limited company limited by shares and transfer of other interest of a member in a company limited by guarantee. Following the decision of this Court in V.B. Rangaraj vs. V.B. Gopalkrishnan and others reported in 1992 (1) SCC 160 wherein it is held that the only restriction of the transfer of the shares of the company is as laid down in its Articles of Association and a restriction which is not specified in the Article is not binding either on the company or on the shareholders, the High Court held that as there was no bar of transfer by nomination of other interest in the Articles of Association of MSEA, refusal by MSEA was not justified and legal. It also held that subsequent incorporation of Article 27A in the Articles cannot justify the action of the MSEA. It, therefore, allowed the appeal and directed MSEA to transfer the interest of Narendera Kumar Agrawal in the company in favour of Smt. Saroj Maloo. While doing so, the High Court observed that it has proceeded only on the basis that there was no such bar for transfer when the application was made. It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the High Court did not consider all the relevant aspects before directing MSEA to register the transfer. It was submitted that though other interest of member in a company like the shares is a moveable property and transferable the transfer can be made in the manner provided by the Articles of the Association. The learned counsel appearing for MSEA also submitted that if the High Court had carefully examined the Articles of Association of MSEA then it would have noticed that it does contain restrictions with respect to transfer of membership. Section 28 provides that the Articles of Association of a company limited by shares may adopt all or any of the regulations contained in Table A in Schedule I. It further provides that in the case of any such company which is registered after the commencement of the Act if Articles are not registered or if Articles are registered in so far as Articles do not exclude or modify the regulations contained in Table A those regulations shall in so far as applicable be the regulations of the company in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were contained in duly registered Articles. In respect of other companies Section 29 provides that the Articles of Association of such company shall be in such one of the forms in Tables C, D and E in Schedule I as may be applicable or in a form as near thereto as circumstances admit. It further provides that nothing contained in that Section shall be deemed to prevent a company from including any additional matters in its Articles in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions contained in the form in any of the Tables C, D  Page 3 of 3 and E adopted by the company. In this case, it is not disputed that Table C will be applicable. If Tables A and C are compared it becomes apparent that there are material differences between the two. These differences and their effects have not been considered by the High Court. The High Court has also not considered who can be a member of a company limited by guarantee and of the nature and type like MSEA and whether that would make any difference in the matter of transfer of other interest of a member in such a company. It was submitted that for becoming a member of a company like MSEA certain qualifications are necessary and that would by necessary implication, even in absence of Articles of Association. But restrictions on transfer of membership by nomination. All the relevant material is not before us and, therefore, we do not think it proper to express any opinion on the merits of the controversy raised before us. We are of the opinion that the High Court should have examined all these relevant aspects and ought not to have disposed of the matter by merely observing that no distinction can be made in the matter of transfer of share or other interest between a company limited by shares and a company limited by guarantee. We, therefore, set aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court in Company Appeal No.1 of 1991 and in Civil Review No.55 of 1992 and remit the matter back to the High Court for deciding the appeal afresh after hearing both the sides and considering all the relevant aspects.

Incidentally they also challenged the promotions made on the basis of the impugned promotion policy. Be it noted, it does not appear from the judgment of the High Court that there was any challenge of promotion given to private opposite parties individually.

Sat Pal, the appellant herein, and one Des Raj were placed on trial before the learned Judge, Special Court, Ferozepur for committing the murder of Iqbal Chand in furtherance of their common intention. The trial ended with an order of conviction under Section 302 I.P.C. and sentence of imprisonment for life recorded against Sat Pal and acquittal in favour of Des Raj. Hence this appeal at the instance of Sat Pal. According to the prosecution case, Iqbal was a medical practitioner in his village Chak Burwala and, normally, used to come back home by 10 P.M. As, on September 20, 1984 he did not return home by then his mother Bishan Devi went in his search and found Sat Pal and Des Raj assaulting him with Kulhari and kirch respectively in the premises where he used to practice. She immediately raised alarms and attracted thereby her another son Gurdip, who lived nearby reached there. When both of them started shouting the appellants ran away with their respective weapons. Iqbal, however, died in the meantime. As Wasawa Ram, father of the deceased, had gone to village Dilia Ram which was about 20 kms, from their village, Jaila Singh, uncle of Wasawa Ram, was asked by Bishan Devi to fetch him. After Wasawa Ram arrived in the following morning Bishan Devi, accompanied by him, went to the police station and lodged an information about the incident at 8.30 A.M. On that information a case was registered and investigation was taken by the S.I. Baljinder Singh. He proceeded to the spot, held inquest upon the dead body of labal and after seizing the wearing appareis, sent it for post-mortem examination. He also seized the cot on which his dead body was found and some blood stained earth and made separate parcels in respect of them. He also prepared a rough sketch plan.   of 4 In course of the investigation the appellant was arrested on September 24. 1984 and the shirt he was wearing was seized by the Investigating Officer as he found some blood stains on it. He then interrogated the appellant and pursuant to the statement made by him recovered a blood stained kulhari. The other accused was also apprehended and a blood stained kirch was recovered pursuant to his statement. After examining the witnesses and completing other formalities of investigation the Investigating Officer submitted charge-sheet and in due course the case was committed to the Special Court for trial. The motive that was ascribed by the prosecution for the murderous assault on Iqbal was that the appellant suspected liaison between his sister and the deceased. The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges levelled against him and contended that he had been falsely implicated. To prove its case the prosecution examined five witnesses of whom Bishan Devi (P.W.3) and Gurdip (P.W.4), figured as eye-witnesses. Besides, the prosecution tendered the evidence of some police officials, which was of a formal character, through affidavits and also exhibited the reports of the chemical examiner and the serologist. Though P.W.3 and 4, who narrated the prosecution case as detailed earlier, were subjected to searching cross examination on behalf of the appellant, nothing could be elicited wherefrom it could be said that their version was improbable or unreliable. The F.I.R. that was lodged by P.W.3 on the following morning also corroborates her evidence. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, however, strenuously argued that the unusual delay of about 10 hours in lodging the F.I.R. and absence of any satisfactory explanation for such delay makes the entire prosecution case suspect. According to the learned counsel the murder was a blind one and only to falsely implicate the accused persons a story was concocted by the members of P.W.3’s family and F.I.R. lodged on the following morning. The learned counsel submitted that if the uncle of the deceased could cover a distance of 20 kms, to inform the deceased’s father he could have certainly gone to the police station, which was at a distance of 6 kms, only, that very night, to lodge the F.I.R. if really the incident took place in the manner alleged by the prosecution. We do not find any substance in this contention. Considered in the light of natural and probable human conduct it was only expected of P.Ws.3 and 4 to first report the incident to Wasawa Ram, father of the deceased and await his arrival before taking any other action. No exception can, therefore, be taken to such reaction of P.Ws.3 and 4 nor can it be said there was an unexplained delay in lodging the F.I.R. raising thereby a doubt about the bonafides of the prosecution case. On the contrary, it appears to us, that having regard to the fact that the incident took place in the night at about 10 P.M. the lodging of the F.I.R. in the following morning immediately after arrival of the father of the deceased was a prompt one. The other contention which was raised on behalf of the appellant was that though independent witnesses were available none was examined and therefore an adverse presumption under Section 114 (g) of the Evidence Act should have been drawn by the trial Court against the prosecution. To buttress the above submission the learned counsel drew our attention to the cross-examination of Bishan Devi wherein she had stated that there were a number of houses in  Page 3 of 4 an around the place where the incident took place. The above answer by itself does not support the above contention for there is no evidence on record to show that anyone of the nearby houses had witnessed the incident. While on this point we cannot lose sight of the time when the incident took place and the fact that a reign of terror was prevailing in the State of Punjab at the material time. The next circumstance that corroborates the eye witnesses is the evidence of Dr. Mittal (P.W.1) who held post-mortem examination and found the following injuries on the person of the deceased: 1. Incised would 12 cms. x 3 cms. on the front lateral right side on the elbow with muscles underneath partially cut, verticle and oblique in direction. 2. Incised wound horizontal in direction 17 cms. x 12 cms. cutting through the neck except flap of the skin on the right side at the level of cervical vertebra (5th and 6th). All the structures including the spinal cord were cut. There were multiple cuts producing step ladder pattern at four sides. 3. Incised wound 12 cms. x 1 cm. muscle deep horizontal in direction 2 cms, below injury No.2. 4. Incised wound 5 cms. x 1 cm. with bone underneath fractured on the chin middle part. 5. Incised wound 12 cms. x 3 cms. horizontal in direction with bone underneath cut at places on the left side of the face at the level of the middle of the pinna. The lateral end was seen cutting the pinna. 6. Punctured wound 0.75 cm. x 0.5 cm. on the front of the chest 6 cms. below middle of left clavical with margins inverted and clean cut parallel to each other. The angles were sharp on one side but slightly lacerated on the other. The wound was going backward and injuring the pleura and long tissues. 7. Punctured wound of similar description and size 7 cms. below the nipple injuring the left lung and the pleura. 8. Punctured wound of similar size and description 5 cms. lateral to injury No.7 piercing the wall of the chest injuring lung and diaphragm. 9. Punctured wound of similar size and description 5 cms. below injury No.8 piercing the abdomenial wall peritoneum and injuring the soleen. 10. Punctured would of similar description 0.5 cm. x 0.25 cm. on the right chest 2 cms. from midline at the level of the nipple bone deep. 11. Punctured wound of similar description and size as injury No.9 on the front of the abdomen midline 5 cms. below the sternum injuring the peritoneum and left lobe of the lever. 12. Punctured wound of similar size and description on the posterior side of left fore-arm 4 cms. below elbow, bone deep. 13. Punctured wound of similar size and description on the front side of left fore-arm 4 cms. below elbow, bone deep."" According to him the incised wounds could have been caused by the kulhari (Ex.M/O/1). which was shown to him. The statement made by the appellant (Ex.P/10) pursuant to which the above kulhari was recovered from under a heap of turi in his field also lends assurance to the evidence of P.Ws. 3 and 4. The report of the Serologist and Chemical Examiner that besides the kulhari the seized earth, shirt & pyjama of the deceased and the charpai contained human blood also to some extent support the prosecution case. Now that we have found that the prosecution has conclusively proved that the appellant had assaulted the  Page 4 of 4 deceased with kulhari on his person, the next question is what offence the appellant committed thereby. This question arises in the context of the fact that it was the prosecution case that both the appellant and Des Raj committed the murder in furtherance of their common intention; and since the latter’s acquittal is not based on mistaken identity, the appellant will be liable for his acts only. It, however, appears from the opinion of the doctor that injury No.2 was caused by a kulhari and it was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause instantaneous death. When the nature and location of the injury No.2 is read in the context of the above opinion of the doctor the conclusion is inevitable that the appellant is liable for the offence under Section 302 IPC simpliciter. For the foregoing discussion we uphold the judgment of the trial Court and dismiss the appeal. The appellant, who is on bail, will now surrender to his bail bond to serve out the sentence","JUDGMENT: J U D G M E N T M.K. MUKHERJEE, J. Sat Pal, the appellant herein, and one Des Raj were placed on trial before the learned Judge, Special Court, Ferozepur for committing the murder of Iqbal Chand in furtherance of their common intention. The trial ended with an order of conviction under Section 302 I.P.C. and sentence of imprisonment for life recorded against Sat Pal and acquittal in favour of Des Raj. Hence this appeal at the instance of Sat Pal. According to the prosecution case, Iqbal was a medical practitioner in his village Chak Burwala and, normally, used to come back home by 10 P.M. As, on September 20, 1984 he did not return home by then his mother Bishan Devi went in his search and found Sat Pal and Des Raj assaulting him with Kulhari and kirch respectively in the premises where he used to practice. She immediately raised alarms and attracted thereby her another son Gurdip, who lived nearby reached there. When both of them started shouting the appellants ran away with their respective weapons. Iqbal, however, died in the meantime.

86,,SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE (C.B.I.),"DEEPAK CHOWDHARY & ORS,",17/08/1995,"BENCH: RAMASWAMY, K. BENCH: RAMASWAMY, K. HANSARIA B.L. (J)","JUDGMENT: O R D E R Leave granted. Delay of 232 days condoned. The facts lie in a short compass. During the year 1982, while the respondent no.1 was working as a Branch Manager in Desh Priya branch of the United Bank of India at Calcutta it was realised that certain officers working in that bank had conspired with a creditor and the bank was defrauded for a sum of Rs.45,000/-. On a complaint laid, a crime case was registered and the appellant investigated the matter and submitted the report to the competent authority for sanction, who, by its order dated the 14th January, 1987 accorded sanction under 6(1-c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (for short, ‘PC Act) to file the charge-sheet against the respondent for the offences punishable under Section 120B, 420, 467, 468, 471, 477A, 201 and 109 IPC and also under Section 5(1) (d) read with Section 5(2) of the PC Act. The respondent filed writ petition in the High Court to quash the sanction. The High Court by the impugned order dated the 2nd April, 1992 in Matter No.498/87 quashed the sanction on two grounds, namely, that the respondent was not given any opportunity of hearing before granting sanction and in the departmental enquiry conducted by the Bank, respondent was exonerated of the charge. Therefore, it was not expedient to proceed with the prosecution of the respondent. Hence, the above appeal has been filed. It is contended for the appellant that the question of giving an opportunity to the charged officer before granting sanction does not arise since it is not a quasi-judicial function. Grant of sanction is an administrative function. What is required is that the investigating officer should place all the necessary material before the sanctioning authority who should apply its mind to that material and accord sanction. Therefore, the question of giving   of 2 opportunity of hearing to the accused before granting sanction does not arise. We find force in the contention. The grant of sanction is only an administrative function, though it is true that the accused may be saddled with the liability to be prosecuted in a court of law. What is material at that time is that the necessary facts collected during investigation constituting the offence have to be placed before the sanctioning authority and it has to consider the material. Prima facie, the authority is required to reach the satisfaction that the relevant facts would constitute the offence and then either grant or refuse to grant sanction. The grant of sanction, therefore, being administrative act the need to provide an opportunity of hearing to the accused before according sanction does not arise. The High Court, therefore, was clearly in error in holding that the order of sanction is vitiated by violation of the principles of natural justice. The second ground of departmental exoneration by the disciplinary authority is also not relevant. What is necessary and material is whether the facts collected during investigation would constitute the offence for which the sanction has been sought for. It is not appropriate at this stage to go into the merits of the culpability of the respondent though sought to be contended for by Shri Thopas Roy, the learned counsel. In fairness to the accused, we deem it inappropriate to go into the merits to express any opinion. The appeal is accordingly allowed, the order of the High Court is set aside and the trial court is directed to proceed with the trial against the respondent as expeditiously as possible and conduct joint trial, if trial is not already concluded, along with other accused. If the case has been separated and the trial of other accused has been concluded, then the trial court is directed to expeditiously conclude the trial of the respondent, not exceeding one year","JUDGMENT: O R D E R Leave granted. Delay of 232 days condoned. The facts lie in a short compass. During the year 1982, while the respondent no.1 was working as a Branch Manager in Desh Priya branch of the United Bank of India at Calcutta it was realised that certain officers working in that bank had conspired with a creditor and the bank was defrauded for a sum of Rs.45,000/-. On a complaint laid, a crime case was registered and the appellant investigated the matter and submitted the report to the competent authority for sanction, who, by its order dated the 14th January, 1987 accorded sanction under 6(1-c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (for short, ‘PC Act) to file the charge-sheet against the respondent for the offences punishable under Section 120B, 420, 467, 468, 471, 477A, 201 and 109 IPC and also under Section 5(1) (d) read with Section 5(2) of the PC Act. The respondent filed writ petition in the High Court to quash the sanction. The High Court by the impugned order dated the 2nd April, 1992 in Matter No.498/87 quashed the sanction on two grounds, namely, that the respondent was not given any opportunity of hearing before granting sanction and in the departmental enquiry conducted by the Bank, respondent was exonerated of the charge. Therefore, it was not expedient to proceed with the prosecution of the respondent. Hence, the above appeal has been filed. It is contended for the appellant that the question of giving an opportunity to the charged officer before granting sanction does not arise since it is not a quasi-judicial function. Grant of sanction is an administrative function. What is required is that the investigating officer should place all the necessary material before the sanctioning authority who should apply its mind to that material and accord sanction. Therefore, the question of giving   of 2 opportunity of hearing to the accused before granting sanction does not arise. We find force in the contention.

The entire prosecution case rests on circumstantial evidence. According to the prosecution, the appellant was acquainted with deceased Smt. Shanti Devi. On the intervening night of May 1/2, 1986, the appellant had gone to the hut of the deceased when she was alone and murdered for gain. The circumstances to connect the appellant with the crime are that (1) PW 18,a hotel clerk, had seen the appellant at mid-night on May 1, 1986 in the neighbourhood of the scene of offence; (2) injury on the finger of the appellant; (3) extra-judicial confession said to have been a made to PW 13 on May 2, 1986; and (4) statement made under s.27 of the Evidence Act (Ext. P-8) leading to recovery of gold ornaments of the deceased from the shop of the father of the appellant spoken to by PW 22, the mediator. We have carefully seen the evidence of PW 13 to whom the appellant is alleged to have made extrajudicial confession. He admitted that the appellant had for the first time taken him in a scooter. He did not know the names of the father and the relation of the appellant and had gone with the appellant to the Tankbund, where the appellant is claimed to have made extra-judicial confession. The evidence does not inspire confidence as, according to PW. 13, though he had gone near the dead body and found some person there he did not disclose the alleged confession to anyone at that time. Police too was seen near the dead body, but he did not tell them about it, nor about the availability of the appellant at that time. No ostensible reason was given to take PW.13 into confidence to confess the crime. judicial confession under s.164 was not recorded. PW.22, the recovery witness practically admitted in the cross-examination that he had been taken to the appellant’s father’s shop. His shop was opposite to the police station. He volunteered, at the instance of the Sub-Inspector, to go to the place for recovery. From the tenor of cross   of 2 examination and the answers given by him, it would be clear that he did not know the place of recovery. The other panch witness was not examined to corroborate his evidence. It is hard to accept the uncorroborated sole testimony of PW.22 to believe the recoveries said to have been made. If these two pieces of evidence are excluded from evidence, no other unimpeachable evidence is there to connect the appellant with the crime punishable under s.302 I.P.C. inasmuch as the circumstances of the presence of the appellant near the scene of occurrence, at the mid-night, and an injury on his finger are too weak to form a chain strong enough to tie the appellant with so serious an offence as murder. So, we hold that the prosecution has failed to establish the case against the appellant beyond all reasonable doubt. Even with regard to offence under s.380, if the evidence of PW.22 is excluded, which has to be done for reason already alluded, it would be difficult to sustain this conviction and it is accordingly set aside.

TUKARAM LAXMAN SABLE & ORS. J U D G M E N T B.P.JEEVAN REDDY.J. Leave granted. Heard counsel for the parties. The appellant was? elected as a Councillor of the Khopoli Municipal Council in December 1991. The contesting respondent Shri Sable was also elected as a Councillor. On account of a vacancy occurring in the office of the President of Municipality, an election was held to that office wherein the appellant was elected as the President. Prior to becoming the President, the appellant was the Chairman of a Committee in-charge of awarding contracts. On the basis of certain complaints pertaining to the period he was the Chairman of the said Committee, a notice was issued to the appellant by the Collector calling upon him to show cause why he should not be removed from the officer of the   of 3 Councillor under Section 44 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1965. The appellant showed cause, whereafter the Collector removed him from the office of the Councillor by his order dated 4.10.1994. The operative portion of the order reads: ""Therefore, I, G.T.Bandri, Collector, Raigad-Alibag, hereby, am disqualifying Shri Baby Samuel, present Chairman Khopoli Municipal Council, as member of the Municipal Council, under Sections 44(1) (b) and 44(3) of Maharashtra Municipal Council Act, 1965, and I am declaring that his post as member of the Municipal Council has become vacant from the date 5.10.1994."" Against the said order of removal/disqualification the appellant filed an appeal before the Government under Section 44(5) of the Act alongwith an application for stay. Since no orders were passed on his stay petition, the appellant approached the Bombay High Court by way of Writ Petition (C) No.4465 of 1994. The High Court directed the Government to dispose of the stay petition within one week and the appeal within three months from the date of its order. The order of the High Court was made on October 26, 1994. Inspite of the orders of the High Court, the State Government did not pass any orders on the stay petition. In view of the vacancy occuring in the office of the President of the Municipality on account of the order disqualifying the appellant, the Collector convened a meeting on November 8, 1994 to elect the President of the Municipality, whereas the respondent Shri Sable was elected as the President. On January 7, 1995 the Government allowed the appeal filed by the appellant and set aside the order of the Collector dated 4th October, 1994. The operative portion of the Government’s Order reads: ""In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 44(4) in Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and Industrial Towns Act 1965, the Government cancels the Order bearing No.M.A.1/28444/M.No. 41/94, dated 4/10/94 passed by the Collector to disqualify Shri Baby Samuel as the member of the Municipal Council."" Questioning the aforesaid order of the Government, Shri Sable filed Writ Petition (c) No. 675 of 1995 contending mainly that before allowing the appeal he should have been heard and that not doing so vitiates the order. In this writ petition he applied for stay of implementation of the Government order. Simultaneously the appellant filed a writ petition being 1124 of 1995 for a direction to the authorities to reinstate him in the office of the President of the Municipality as a consequence of the Government’s order. Both the interlocutory applications in the two writ petitions came up for hearing before a Division Bench on 20th March, 1995. The Division Bench granted stay of the operation of the Government’s order dated 7.1.1995 as prayed for by Shri Sable and rejected the application filed by the appellant to reinstate him in the office of the President. The said two orders are questioned in these appeals. The facts stated above disclose that the appellant was removed from the office of the Councillor and as a consequence he lost the office of the President of the Municipality. The Collector’s order reads: ""I.....am  Page 3 of 3 disqualifying Shri Baby Samuel, present Chairman Khopoli Municipal council, as member of the Municipal Council."" Because the State Government did not pass any orders on the stay petition filed by the appellant in his appeal preferred against the orders of removal/disqualification, the Collector notified and held an election to the office of the President whereat Shri Sable was elected as President. This election was again a consequence of the removal/disqualification of the appellant by the Collector. If so, once the order of removal/disqualification is set aside by the Government, the appellant is entitled to be put back in the same position which he was in before he was removed. In other words not only should he be restored to the Councillorship but also to the office of the President. Shri Sable was elected as the President in the vacancy caused by the removal/disqualification of the appellant and once the said removal/disqualification of the appellant goes, the consequential action cannot stand; it falls to ground alongwith the order of removal. Shri Sable must therefore yield ground to the appellant. Dr. Ghatate, learned counsel for Shri Sable submitted that since the impugned orders are interlocutory in nature, this Court should not interfere under Article 136 of the Constitution. He suggested that the writ petitions may be directed to be heard expeditiously. To this Shri Vaidyanathan, learned counsel for the appellant demurred stating that the term of the appellant will be coming to an end in the year 1996 (next year) and since there is no real possibility of the aforesaid writ petitions being heard in the near future, denial of relief in this appeal could cause grave prejudice to the appellant. He submitted that the impugned orders in effect amount to dismissal of the appellant’s writ petition and to allowing of Shri Sable’s writ petition. We are of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of this case and keeping in mind the respective rights of the parties, this is a proper case where we should interfere under Article 136. It is also admitted that as on today, no fresh or other proceedings have been initiated for removal/disqualification of the appellant for any alleged irregularities. In the circumstances, denying him the office of President would amount to punishing him for no fault of his. It cannot be that he is not guilty and yet he is removed from the offices held by him. Shri Sable’s writ petition is yet to be decided. Accordingly the appeals are allowed and the interim orders dated 20.3.1995 made in Writ Petition (C) No. 675 of 1995 and writ Petition (C) No.1124 of 1995 on 20th March, 1995, impugned herein, are set aside. The appellant shall be restored forthwith to the office of the Councillor of Khopoli Municipality as well as to the office of the President of the said Municipality.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated June 25, 1984 passed by the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 286 of 1980 whereby it affirmed the conviction and sentence recorded against the four appellants under Section 302/34 of the Indian Penal Code by the Sessions Judge, Bhandara. According to the prosecution case in the night between October 15/16, 1984 Antiram met with his death at the hands of his sons by his first wife (appellant Nos. 1 and 2 herein) and two sons of her brother (the other two appellants). The motive ascribed for the killing was that the deceased and his first wife, whom he had deserted some 10/12 years back, were fighting for long over the ownership of the house in which the murder took place. In proving the charges levelled against the appellants, the prosecution rested its case principally upon the ocular version of the incident as given out by Bhivarabai (P.W.21) the mother of the deceased and Suresh (PW 22), a son of the sister of Antiram, who at the material time was 8 years old. Though the trial Court relied upon the evidence of both the witnesses to find the appellants guilty, the High Court found it unsafe to rely upon the child witness in view of obvious reservations in that regard and certain major contradictions in his evidence vis-a-vis his statement recorded under Section 161 of the code of Criminal Procedure. The High Court, however, found PW 21 was transparently honest and narrated the events in a truthful manner. In drawing the above conclusion the High Court observed: ""She had the traumatic experience of witnessing the macabre tragedy of her own grandsons to be jailed for life more so when an average Indian elderly woman   of 3 prizes sons over anything else being the perpetuators of the family tree? The degree of cogency of evidence contained in the deposition of Bhivarabai has reached to such a high degree of probability that we unhesitatingly conclude that the learned Additional Sessions Judge was right in finding the accused persons guilty of offence under section 302 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentencing them to undergo imprisonment for life."" At first blush we also felt that we will not be justified, while exercising our jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, in disturbing the concurrent findings of fact recorded by the learned Courts below, more so for the reason canvassed by the High Court in the above quoted passage, but having gone through the entire materials on record we are firmly of the opinion that the evidence of PW 21 that she had properly seen the incident and correctly identified the appellants as the miscreants cannot be safely relied upon. We do not for a moment suggest that as a grand-mother she would falsely implicate her grandsons as observed by the High Court but as our discussion to follow will show, her identification of the appellants can justifiably be attributed to her optical aberrations. In her testimony PW 21 stated that after she, her son Antiram and grandson Suresh took food together she and Suresh went to sleep in one room while Antiram went to the adjoining chabari. According to her the door in between the room and the chapari was closed from inside. She next stated that around mid-night she was awakened by the sound of beating and therefore, she tried to open the door in between the chapari and her room only to find that the door was chained from outside also. However, she claimed, she could see all the four accused persons (the appellants) beating his son Antiram with ubharies while she was seated on the cot. She asserted that she could identify the appellants through the gap between the two doors and not through the crevices of the planks. As regards the source of light, she stated that the electric bulb of the street pole in front of her house illuminated the chapari enabling her to see the incident and identify the miscreants. It appears from the record that for properly appreciating the evidence of PW 21, the trial Judge visited and inspected the locale, recorded a memorandum of the relevant facts observed at such inspection (Ext. 32) and placed the same on record in accordance with Section 310 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the report the trial Judge recorded, inter alia, as under: ""The door opening in the room from chapari closed from the side of the chapari by means of the chain and seen from inside - The room into the chapari by myself, A.P.P. Shri Raut and Shri Saxena Adv. for accd. a) Nothing could be seen from the gaping in between the 2 doors (shutters). b) The central pillar of the chapari and the gate (entrance) of the chapari is Visible from the crevices in between the planks of both the shutters."" (emphasis supplied) From the above quoted passage of the report of inspection it  Page 3 of 3 is evidently clear that PW 21 could not have seen the incident, much less identify the miscreants in view of her categorical statement, as mentioned earlier, that she saw through a gap between the two doors and not through the crevices of the planks. This apart, the report nowhere indicates that the entire chapari was visible through the crevices of the planks even if we proceed on the assumption that she could see the incident through the crevices. On the contrary, the report indicates only the pillar and gate of the chapari were visible. Unfortunately, however, neither of the learned Courts below did give much importance to this aspect of the matter and proceeded on the basis that it was a minor mistake. We are however unable to share the above view as it is evident from Ext.32 that P.W.21 could not have properly seen the incident much less, identify the miscreants. Having regard to the fact that the success of the prosecution rested upon the testimony of P.W. 21 alone we feel that the learned Courts below ought not to have placed implicit reliance upon the evidence of PW 21 solely on the ground that as a grand-mother she was not expected to implicate her grandsons falsely. Then again PW 21 has admitted in cross examination that her eye sight was weakened and she could not properly see an object beyond a distance of about one foot. As regard the source of light, the trial Court has noticed that distance of the street pole on the road was at a distance of 55 ft from the east corner of the central room of the house. In that context it is difficult to hold that from the light emanating from the street pole from such a distance it could be possible for P.W. 21 to see the incident properly, more so when she had a defective vision. On the conclusions as above, it must be said that the prosecution has not been able to prove its case against the appellants beyond all reasonable doubts. The order of conviction and sentence recorded against the appellants is therefore set aside and they are acquitted of the charge under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. As the appellants are on bail, they are discharged from their bail bonds","JUDGMENT: JUDGMENT M.K.MUKHERJEE.J.

92,,AMARJIT SINGH,STATE OF PUNJAB,27/07/1995,BENCH: NANAVATI G.T. (J) BENCH: NANAVATI G.T. (J) MUKHERJEE M.K. (J),"JUDGMENT: J U D G M E N T M.K. MUKHERJEE. J. This appeal under Section 14 of the Terrorist Affected Areas (Special Courts) Act, 1984 is directed against the Judgment and order dated March 26, 1985 rendered by the Additional Judge, Special Court, Hoshiarpur convicting the appellant under Section 302 of the Indian Fenal Code for committing the murder of his grand-father Mehar Singh on March 6, 1984 and sentencing him to imprisonment for life. The prosecution case is that the deceased Mehar Singh owned 22.1/2 willss of land in village Swal’ and 10.1/2 killas of land in village Alfuke. About four years before his death Mehar Singh had divided his land in village Swal in three equal shares and given one share to his son Mangat Singh, another to his son Kirpal Singh, father of the appellant, and retained the balance. While Mangat Singh, with whom Mehar Singh used to live cultivated his share of that land and also that of Mehar Singh, the appellant cultivated the land given to his father. Being apprehensive that Mehar Singh might give his share of land in village Swal as also his land in village Alfuke to Mangat Singh the appellant was putting pressure upon him for a moiety share in the land retained by him in village Swal and also the land in village Alfuke. Since Mehar Singh was not yielding to such demand the latter was very much annoyed with him. On March 6, 1984, at or about 8 A.M. when Mangat Singh, his brother-in-law Hazara Singh and Mehar Singh were returning from the tubewell in their village the appellant came from the opposite direction on a bicycle armed with a Kirpan. He stopped Mehar Singh, barked his bicycle by the side of the pathway and told him that as he had decided to transfer his share of land to Mangat Singh and did not accede to his demand he would not leave him alive. With these words he started infliciting repeated Kirpan blows upon Mehar Singh as a result of which he fall down dead.   of 4 Before however Mangat Singh and Hazare Singh, who were little behind Mehar Singh, could reach there the appellant fled away with the Kirpan through the fields leaving behind his bicycle, shoes and turban. Mangat Singh immediately left for the police station asking Hazara Singh to guard the dead body. On the way he met ABI Avtar Singh near village Mewa Singh Wala and narrated the incident to him. ABI Avtar Singh recorded the statement of Mangat Singh (EX.P.F) and sent it to the police station with his endorsement thereon (EX.P.F(17) to register a case. Accompanied by Mangat Singh, Avtar Singh then went to the spot, held inquest upon the dead body of Mehar Singh and forwarded it for post-mortem examination. From the spot he seized some blood stained earth, cair of shoes. Bicycle and guroan and then prepared a rough sketch plan. In course of the investigation he arrested the appellant on March 11, 1984 and pursuant to his statement recovered a blood stained Kirpan (EX.P.1). Avtar Singh sent all the blood stained seized articies for chemical examination and on receipt of report of such examination submitted charge-sheet against the appellant. The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges levellen against him and contended that Mehar Singh used to live with him as his father was insane and his brother was panalytic. He further contended that it was he - and not Mangat Singh - who was cultivating the share of Mehar Singh and that it was Mangat Singh who pressing the deceased to give half share out of the land retained by him out the latter did not agree. As regards the incident the appellant s version was that as usual Mehar Singh had gone to the tubewell in the morning but he was in his house. While in the house, he learnt through the chowkidar that Mehar Singh had been killed. On getting that information he went to the spot and found a number of persons present. According to him it was Mangat Singh who registered a false case against him. His further defence was that Hazara Singh was also enimical towards him as his wife (daughter of Mehar Singh) did not get any share out of the property of Mehar Singh and, therefore, he was siding with Mangat Singh. That Mehar Singh met with a homicidal death on the fateful day stands conclusively proved by the overwhelming evidence on record. In fact, this part of the prosecution case was not challenged by the appellant. Apart from the evidence of Mangat Singh (P.W.4) and Hazara Singh (P.W.5) there is the evidence of Investigating Officer ASI Avtar Singh (P.W.7), who deposed that he found the dead body on the wheat field, and that of Dr. Jasbin Singh (P.W.3) who held postmortem examination on the dead body and found as many as 24 injuries on his person. According to P.W.3 all the injuries were ante mortem and were sufficient to cause death in ordinary course. The next and the most crucial question that falls for consideration is whether the prosecution has succeeded in conclusively proving that the appellant was responsible for the homicidal death of Mehar Singh. To prove this part of its case the prosecution relied, needless to say, principally upon the evidence of Mangat Singh (P.W.4) and Hazara Singh (P.W.5). Both these witnesses testified that while they were coming back from the tubewell after their morning ablutions along with Mehar Singh, who was a little ahead of them, they saw the appellant coming from the opposite direction on a bicycle with a Kirpan in his hand. They next testified that the appellant accosted Mehar Singh and said that as he had not yielded to his demand he will not allow him to live. With these words, he inflicted a  Page 3 of 4 number of blows with his Kirpan upon Mehar Singh resulting in his instantaneous death. P.W.4 also testified about the genesis of the trouble, detailed earlier. Having regard to the fact that Mangat Singh (P.W.4) and Hazara Singh (P.W.5) were closely related to the deceased we have considered and assessed their evidence with more than ordinary care and caution. Having done so we do not find any reason for disbelieving them more particularly when nothing could be elicited in cross-examination to discredit them. On the contrary, we find, that the evidence of Mangat Singh (P.W.4) stands fully corroborated by the First information Report which was lodged by him within two hours of the incident and contains the substratum of the entire prosecution case. The next corroboration of the evidence of P.W.4 and P.W.5 is furnished by the evidence of Dr. Jasbir Singh (P.W.3) when he said that all the injuries found by him on the person of the deceased could be caused by a sharp edged weapon like a Kirpan or any other heavy weapon with sharp edges. When the Kirpan (EX.P.1) seized during the investigation was shown to him, the doctor opined that it could cause the injuries found on the person of the deceased. Another circumstance, on which the prosecution relied in support of its case was that the blood stained Kirpan (EX.P.1) was discovered pursuant to the statement made by the appellant to the effect that he has concealed it. We have carefully considered the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this regard, particularly that of P.W.7. and have found the same convincing and reliable. Coupled with the above evidence is the report of the Serologist which shows that human blood was found on the Kirpan. The evidence of P.W.4 and P.W.5 that after the appellant fled away his turban, shoes and bicycle were found there gets support from the seizure of these articles from the spot by P.W.7. From the chemical analysis report we further get that human blood was found on the turban but the origin of the blood found on the shoes could not be determined as it was disintegrated. It was however, contended on behalf of the appellant that the story of the prosecution that the appellant left behind his turban, shoes and bicycle was a purely concocted one for it was absurd to believe that the appellant would leave behind those articles to implicate himself. According to the learned counsel for the appellant, if the incident took place in the manner alleged by the prosecution the appellant would have certainly fled away on the bicycle - rather than on foot to ensure a speedier escape. We are not at all impressed by this contention. Considering the manner in which the appellant gave repeated blows upon the deceased and the resistence the latter but by trying to ward off the blows which is evident from the fact that both his hands were chopped off - the droping down of the turban was not unlikely. As regards the shoes and the bicycle, the appellant had left those behind obviously because he made the wheat fields his escape route: and the best and convenient way to make good an escape through such a route would be to run barefooted. It was also contended on behalf of the appellant that the learned court below should not have discarded the evidence of Smt. Inder Kaur (D.W.1) who fully supported the appellant s version and accepted that of her brother P.W.4 as relationshipwise they stood on the same footing. To appreciate this contention we have carefully considered her evidence as also the reasons which weighed with the trial Court in disbelieving her. The trial Court observed that if  Page 4 of 4 the appellant had been cultivating the lands of Mehar Singh all along, as testified by her, the appellant’s name must have been appearing as the cultivator in the record of rights and that document would have been the best evidence. The trial Court further observed that according to her evidence the police had gone to the village at 6 or 7 A.M. on the fateful day but it was nobody’s case that the incident had occurred by then. The trial Court fastly held that if really D.W.1 felt that the appellant had been falsely implicated, it was expected of her to approach the Investigating Officer, who according to her was present in the village, and testify about the same. All the above considerations, in our view, are germane to discredit the defence witness. While on this point it will be pertinent to mention that even if us proceed on the assumption that the motive ascribed by the prosecution for the incident in not true and that the defence version as given out by D.W.1 in this regard is acceptable still then we will not be justified in discarding the prosecution case altogether, for law is now well settled that where the positive evidence against the accused is clear, cogent and reliable the question of motive and, for that matter, proof thereof pale into insignificance. For the foregoing discussion we do not find any merit in this appeal and dismiss the same. The appellant who is on pail will now surrender to his ball bond to serve out the sentence","JUDGMENT: J U D G M E N T M.K. MUKHERJEE. J.

For the foregoing discussion we do not find any merit in this appeal and dismiss the same. The appellant who is on pail will now surrender to his ball bond to serve out the sentence"

PARIPOORNAN, K.S.(J)","JUDGMENT: WITH CIVIL APPEL NOS. 399-400 OF 1973 ORDER These appeals are by certificate of fitness granted by the High Court under Article 133(1) of the Constitution of India. Notification under s.4(1) of Land Acquisition Act. 1894(for short, ""the Act"") was published on October 15, 1959 acquiring 10 acres and 12 gunthas of land situated in Jamnagar for the establishment under development of T.B. Hospital. The appellants laid a claim pursuant to the rate of Rs. 1,08,898/- per acre. The Land Acquisition officer in his award dated July 18, 1962 under s.11 awarded a sum of Rs.2,500/- per acre. Dissatisfied therewith, a Reference to the Civil Judge senior division was made under s.18 of the Act. The appellants restricted their claim to Rs.2.00 per sq. ft. The Civil Court enhanced the compensation to Rs. 1.25 per sq. ft. The High Court in the impugned judgment in the First Appeal Nos. 521 and 519 of 1963 dated 28.7.72 set aside the award and decree of the Reference Court and confirmed that of the Collector. Since the value involved is more than 20,000/- the High Court granted a certificate. Thus these appeals. The learned counsel for the appellants strenuously contended that Ex.39 dated August 8, 1959 to an extent of 5016 sq. ft. land was sold by Jaisukhlal Devji who was examined under Ex. 32, for a sum worked out at the rate of Rs. 2.25 per sq. ft. and the High Court was not justified in rejecting that sale deed. In addition, he also placed reliance on Ex. 38 dated December 6, 1959 of Rs. 2,700/ which worked out at the rate of Rs. 2.88 per sq. ft. proved through Lawshankar Monucha Manilal examined under Ex. 28 who is the son of the vendee. It would also establish, according to the counsel, that there is a further increase in the value of the land. He also buttressed his argument by reference to Ex. 41 dated July 12, 1990 under which 1200 sq.   of 2 ft. was sold by Vijaykunvarba who was examined as Ex. 176 a neighbouring land. The High Court therefore, was not justified in reversing the award and decree of the Civil Court . We find no force in the contention. It is settled law that the claimants like plaintiffs are entitled to succeed for higher compensation only on proof of value prevailing as on the date of notification. What is the prevailing market value as on the date of notification is a question of fact to be proved by adducing evidence. Burden is always on him to prove the same. It is seen that the appellant himself purchased the land in 1957 at the rate of Rs.190 per acre. The land adjacent to the land under acquisition in s.No. 225-I admeasuring 8 acres 39 gunthas was purchased by one Umiyashankar Damodar Vyas under Ex. 55 on August 25, 1960 at the rate of 568 per acre. Ex.39 strongly relied upon by the claimants was executed just two months prior to the date of the Notification. It is common knowledge that issuance of Notification under s.4(1) to intiate acquisition would take considerable time and the publecation of the NOtification under s.4(1) of the Act would be made much later on. Having had knowledge, it would be obvious that documents would be brought into existence to inflate the market value. Ex. 39 was sought to be pressed into service to inflate the market value. The conclusion of the High Court is that no attempt was made by the claimant or the vendor or vendee who were examined, to prove Ex.p.39 to prove the distance of the land covered in Ex.p-39 and the land under acquisition or as a comparable sale. We have seen the award of the Collector. All the sales referred in the award would only show the sales on acrage basis. Obviously the documents have been brought into existence on the basis of the sq. ft. to inflate higher market value. The property of 10 acres and 12 gunthas , when offered for sale in the open market, no prudent purchaser would be willing to purchase the same on sq. ft. basis. If the small extent of land in a commercial area, like Nariman point in Bombay or Connaught Place in Delhi is sought to be acquired, perhaps, determination of the compensation on the basis of the sq. ft. may be justified. But when the claimant himself assessed the market value at Rs. 190/- per acre and purchased in 1957 and when in 1960 the 8 acres and 39 gunthas of nighbouring land was sold for Rs. 568/- per acre, no prudent purchaser would offer to purchase on square foot basis. This Court in a catena of decisions deprecated the practice of the reference courts or High Court to determine market value of the lands on sq.ft. basis unless it is established as a fact that the acquired lands are situated in already highly developed residential and industrial area where regular sales are on sq.ft. basis. The High Court also has given cogent and well considered reasons in not accepting the award and decree of the Reference Court. We have carefully gone through the judgment and we find no compelling reasons to differ from the cogent reasons given by the High Court.

Appellants & Ors. -v Union of India & ors. ... Respondents J U D G M E N T Mrs. Sujata V. Manohar, J. Special leave granted. The present appeal is from an order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench, dated 6.5.1994 by which the appellants’ appointments to the post of Guard have been set aside. At the material time the appellants were holding the substantive posts of Trains Clerks in the pay scale of Rs.1200-2040(RP). They were, however, provisionally promoted to the posts of Assistant Head Train Clerks in the pay-scale of Rs.1400-2300. The Eastern Railway issued a Circular dated 10.9.91 for filling up the 152 posts of Good Guards which included the backlog of previous selection, in the pay-scale of Rs.1200-2040, by departmental promotion from different eligible streams. One of the eligible streams was of Train Clerks in the pay-scale of Rs.1200-2040. Under the Circular dated 10.9.91 the last date for sending   of 2 applications was 30.9.91. Since the appellants were holding the substantive post of Train Clerks they applied for their reversion to the substantive post of Train Clerks and applied for the post of Guard as per the Circular dated 10.9.91. The applications were made before 30th of September,1991. The request of the appellants for reversion to the substantive post of Train Clerks was accepted on 6.12.91. Thereafter, the appellants functioned in the post of Train Clerks from the dates which are set out in the Chart which has been annexed at 9 of the paper-book. From their respective dates of reversion any payment received by them as Assistant Head Train Clerk has also been recovered/deducted from their salary. The Railway Board had been moved in the meanwhile by the Divisional Railway Manager in connection with, inter alia, the request of the appellants to be allowed to apply for the post of Guards and this permission has been granted by the Railway Board by their letter dated 13.8.92, a copy of which is annexed as R I to the counter-affidavit of respondents 1 to 3. As per the letter of 13.8.92 in the selection process which had started, Train Clerks who were in the grade of Rs.1400-2300 were allowed to appear for selection to the post of Goods Guard as a last exception. Pursuant to the applications which were received as aforesaid, selection test were held in March, 1992 by which day the appellants had reverted to the post of Train Clerks. They were allowed to appear for the test and were ultimately selected by Office Order dated 17.11.92 when the selection list was published. The selected persons were sent for 37 days’ training and thereafter were given the posting as Goods Guards at different places. Respondents 4 to 23 challenged the selection of the appellants before the Tribunal on 15th of December, 1992. This challenge has been upheld by the Tribunal. Looking to the fact that the appellants were only provisionally holding the post of Assistant Head Train Clerks and were holding the substantive post of Train Clerks, the appellants were eligible for selection for the post of Guard. They were also reverted to their substantive post and excess pay was recovered from them in November and December, 1991 prior to their being allowed to appear for selection test. Any doubt on this score is set at rest by the letter of 13.8.1992. The Tribunal was, therefore, not right in setting aside the selection of the appellants and cancelling their appointments to the post of Guard. The order of the Tribunal is accordingly set aside.

This appeal is from an order of the Central Administratice Tribunal, Allahabad Bench, dated 22nd of April, 1994 in O. A. No.849/1993. The respondent was granted selection grade (non funcational) in the post of Deputy Commissioner of Incometex with effect from 1.1.86, by an office order dated 11.3.92. The respondent was paid an amount of Rs.20,772/- pursuant to the granting of the selection grade to him w.e.f. 1.1.86, in the last week of March, 1992. The respondent filed the above O.A. No.849/1993 before the Central Administratice Tribunal claiming interest on the said amount from 1.1.86 to the end of March, 1992. The tribunal by the impugned otrder has granted interest @ 12% per annum for the saidf period to the respondent. This order is challenged in the present appeal. The respondent jouned the Indian Revenue Service in 1969. He was promoted as Deputy Commissioner of Incometax in the year 1979. The respondent was considered fro thr grant of non-functional selection grade by the Departmental Promotion Committee held in May/June 1990. His case was   of 3 deferred as his Confidential Reports were not available. His name was again considered by the Departmental Promotion Committee held after 3 month in September 1990. As the integrity of the respondent was not certified by the vigilance departmental, and two memoranda had already been issued to him calling for his explanation, the findings of the Departmental Promotion Committee relating to the respondent were kept in a sealed cover in accordance with the provision contained in the DOP&T OM No.22011/2/86 East(A) dated 12th of January 1988. The respondent approached the Central Administratice Tribunal at Delhi against the adoption of the procedure of a sealed cover in the matter of grant of selection grade to him. The Tribunal by its order dated 3rd of January, 1991 ordered the Department to give effect to the recommendations of the Departmental Promotion Committee w.e.f. 1st of January 1986, this being the date from which person junior to the respondent were granted non-functional selection grade, provided he was declared fit by the Departmental Promotion Committee. On 16th of July 1991 a charge-sheet was served on the respondent. The Department, however, in view of the above order of the Tribunal, took steps of implement the order by adopting the appropriate departmental procedure for opening the sealed cover. When the sealed cover was opened the respondent was found fit. The requisite approval from the Finance Ministry was obtained on 5th of March, 1992. Thereafter, orders were issued granting non-functional selection grade to the respondent on 11th of March, 1992. The consequent payment 1992. We are further informed that the departmental proceedings are still pending against the respondent. In these ciroumstances we have to examine whether ther order of the Tribunal granging interest @ 12% per annum to the respondent for the period January 1986 to March 1992 can be upheld. In the first place, there is no provision of law under which such interest can be granted. Learned Advocte for the respondent, however, has contended before us that on equitable considerations, the Tribunal has granted interest @ 12% per annum to the respondent and we need not interfere with the discretion exercised by the Tribunal in this regard. But looking to the facts and circumstances of the present case, we cannot accept the submission made by learned Advocate for the respondent. Before any interest can be granted on equitable considerations, it is necessary that the facts of the case should be examined to ascertian whether there are any special equties which would justify the grant of such interest although there is no provision in law for such grant. We have failed to find any such equities in favour of the respondent in the present case. The respondent alongwith others was considereed by the Departmental Promotion, Committee for the grant of selection grade only in 1990. All those who were selected by the Departmental Promotion Committee and granted selsction grade w.e.f. 1.1.86 were given the difference in salary and other emoluments soon after the issuance of the order granting them selection grade. None of them received interest from January 1986 on the amounts so paid, althought they were granted selsecion grade w.e.f. 1.1.86 In the case of the Departmental Promotion committee immediately and the sealed cover procedure had to be resorted to because his intergarity was not certified by the Department in view of the two memoranda having already been issued to the respondent. We will assume in favour of the respondent that these memoranda as well as the chargesheed which has been  Page 3 of 3 subsequently issed, are unwarpanted. navertheless, the Departmental Promotion Committee was required to adopt the sealed cover procedure for vailed reasons. it was only on account of the order dated 3rd of January, 1991 issued by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Delhi, that the sealed cover was opened, although investigations were pending and a charge-sheet had also been issued. In these circumstances selection grade was granted to the respondent by the order dated 11th of March 1992. It is difficult to see any equities in favour of the respondent which would require granting on any iterset to him form 1st January, 1986 as has been done in the present case. At any rate, when the Departmental Enquiry is not complete and the respondent has not so far been exonerated of the charges made against him, the grant of interest appears to be wholly unjustified. In the above circumstances, as we fail to see any kind of equity in favour of the respondent, the impugned order of the Tribunal is set aside and the appeal is allowed.

It is difficult to see any equities in favour of the respondent which would require granting on any iterset to him form 1st January, 1986 as has been done in the present case. At any rate, when the Departmental Enquiry is not complete and the respondent has not so far been exonerated of the charges made against him, the grant of interest appears to be wholly unjustified. In the above circumstances, as we fail to see any kind of equity in favour of the respondent, the impugned order of the Tribunal is set aside and the appeal is allowed. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs"
96,,HAL EMPLOYEES UNION,THE PRESIDING OFFICER AND ANR.,01/05/1995,"K. RAMASWAMY, SUJATA V. MANOHAR","JUDGMENT: O R D E R This appeal by special leave arises from the award of the Industrial Tribunal, Lucknow made in Adj. Case No. 7708/83 on 28.4.1984. The admitted facts are that the respondent declared lock-out from 4/5th June, 1978 and wages to the workmen were deducted for that period. An industrial dispute was raised which came to be referred under Section 4-k of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the state Act which is equivalent to Section 10(1) (c) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the Central Act. The Tribunal after considering the entire evidence on record and appreciating the diverse contentions raised by the counsel on either side, recorded, as a fact, the finding that the lock out declared by the respondent w.e.f. 4/5th June, 1978 to 18th June, 1978 was both just and lawful, hence the question of any relief to the workmen does not arise. It is contended by Shri A.k. Goel, learned counsel for the appellant, that on the own showing of the respondents it is not a case of total strike by the rival unions; there was production to the extent of 15% which would show that the strike which ended on May 31, 1978 and the lock-out declared on 4/5th June, 1978 was not due to continuing strike and that, therefore, the management was not justified in reaching the conclusion without following the procedure prescribed under Section 6-s(2) of the state Act which is equivalent to Section 22 (3) of the Central Act, to declare lock-out. With a view to appreciate the contention, it is necessary to extract the relevant provisions of the Act. Section 22 falls in Chapter V which deals with strikes and lock-outs. It prohibits strikes and says that no person employed in public utility service shall go on strike in breach of contract as enumerated in clauses (a) and (d) of sub-section (1) thereof. Sub-section (2) prohibits declaration of lock-out for the circumstances mentioned in the clauses (a) to (d) of sub-section (2). Sub-section (3) postulates that ""the notice of lock-out or strike under this section shall not be necessary where there is already in existence a strike or, as the case may be, lock-out in the public utility service, but the employer shall send intimation of such lock-out or strike on the day on which it   of 2 is declared, to such authority as may be specified by the appropriate Government either generally or for a particular area or for a particular class of public utility services."" Section 24 declares what are illegal strikes or illegal lock-outs. It says that ""a lock-out declared in consequence of an illegal strike or a strike declared in consequence of an illegal lock out shall not be deemed to be illegal"". It is seen that the strike continued until 4/5th June, 1978 and the lock-out was continued upto 18th June, 1978. In view of the finding recorded by the Tribunal that there was an illegal strike in consequence of which the lock-out was declared by the respondent-Management, it cannot be declared that the lock-out is illegal. On that finding, the question arises: whether they are entitled to the payment of wages for the period of lock-out? The controversy as regard illegal strike and payment of wages for that period was considered by this Court in Syndicate Bank and Anr. vs. K. Umesh Nayak [(1994) 5 SCC 572] by a Constitution Bench. It was held that ""no-work no pay"" is the principle applicable to public utility services; wages during strike period would be payable only if the strike is both legal and justified but not payable if strike is legal but not justified or justified but illegal. The strike may be of different forms like go-slow, work to rule, refusal to work overtime, irritation strike etc. we are bound by the ratio of the said Constitution Bench judgment which applies to declaration of the lock-out which is the consequence of illegal strike organized by the workmen. The lock-out is both legal and justified in the present case. As a result, the workmen are not entitled to the payment of wages for the period during which the lock-out continued. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs","JUDGMENT: O R D E R This appeal by special leave arises from the award of the Industrial Tribunal, Lucknow made in Adj. Case No. 7708/83 on 28.4.1984.

97,,ALL INDIA JUDGE’S ASSOCIATION & ORS.,UNION OF INDIA & ORS.,10/04/1995,BENCH: AHMADI A.M. (CJ) BENCH: AHMADI A.M. (CJ) BHARUCHA S.P. (J),"JUDGMENT: 1. By our judgment in Review Petitions rendered on 24th August, 1993 the date of compliance of certain directions issued earlier by the Judgment of 13th November, 1991 came to be extended up to 31st March, 1994 (See 1993 (4) SCC 288 at 317). More than a year has since passed. We find that the directions have not been complied with fully by most of the States. That is presumably because it has not been possible for the State Governments to construct sufficient houses for judicial officers even though some of the State Governments have granted administrative approvals and sanctioned funds for the grant thereof, However, that may take some time but in the meantime some arrangement ought to be made because the question of residential accommodation to judicial officers is a first priority requirement. What the interim arrangement should be is a matter in regard to which we have heard counsel for the respective State Governments. In the case of the State of Gujarat we had on an earlier occasion, i.e on 19.8,94, passed an order to the effect that the judicial officer should be granted residential accommodation of the standard to which they are entitled having regard to their status from the general pool on priority basis. It should be made clear that when we state that the quarters should be allotted to judicial officers on priority basis, the direction should be complied with letter and-spirit and not by permitting special category allotments by-passing allotment to judicial officers. If despite the same sufficient quarters are not available from the common pool and it becomes necessary to requisition or hire private accommodation the State Government should direct the respective Collectorates to locate accommodation of the prescribed standard and allot the same to the judicial officers. In cases where that is not done or is not possible for want of accommodation or even though the judicial officer is able to point out accommodation but for some valid reason it is not possible for the State Government to requisition or hire the same and the Judicial   of 3 officer is compelled to hire accommodation for himself, the rental in excess of what the judicial officer is entitled to by way of H.R.A., must be borne by the State Government pro vided the judicial officer intimates the State Government that on account of its default he has selected a house at a particular rental and would be occupying the same. If after such intimation the State Government \ Collectorate does not provide accommodation to the judicial officer within a month’s time the judicial officer will be entitled to hire the house and the State Government will pay the rental in excess of the H.R.A. admissible to the judicial 576 officer for the accommodation. In the case of judicial officers already in occupation of private accommodation the same benefit should be extended to them also, namely, of payment of the excess amount for the accommodation. In order that the State Government may have reasonable time to comply with this direction we direct that this order should be worked out as early as possible and will become effective from 1st August, 1995. It is needles to impress upon the State Governments that we expect scrupulous implementation of this order because by the date 1.8.95 more than reasonable time would have elapsed since the making of the order in the Review Application. A copy of this order will be sent to the Chief Secretary of every State Government who shall be personally responsible for the implementation of the order, failure, if any, will invite drastic action. Re: Working Library: 2. In regard to making available a working library for the judicial officers at different stations we find that most of the States have failed to comply with the direction fully. We find it difficult to appreciate why such a simple direction has not been complied with thus far. There are two methods by which compliance can be ensured. Firstly, by determining the library requirements and providing the books to the judicial officers or by working out the cost factor and providing finance to the High Court to provide the books to the judicial officers. This should not have taken so long and the State Governments should have shown urgency in equipping the judicial officers with a minimum working library to ensure efficient performance. With a view to giving a last opportunity to the State Governments to comply with the direction we direct that those State Governments which have failed to comply with the directions shall do so before 1.8.95. Re: All India Judicial Service: 3. On 17.2.95 Mr. Altaf Ahmad the learned Additional Solicitor General had stated that with regard to the Court’s directive for setting up an All India Judicial Service the Union of India will file an affidavit stating what action it has taken for the implementation of that direction. Ac cordingly, an affidavit has been filed which shows that certain steps were taken but the distance that has to be covered to achieve the objective is yet a long one. Unless the Union of India takes effective steps in the direction of setting up of an All India Judicial Service the question of uniformity of designations as well as pay scales will also linger on. We would, therefore, like to impress upon the Union of India to take immediate measures for the implementation of the direction to achieve the objective of setting up of an All India Judicial Service. We would also like to know from the Union of India what action it has taken or proposes to take for setting up of a National Pay Commission for members of the Subordinate Judiciary. The three directions in regard to uniformity of designations,  Page 3 of 3 pay scales and setting up of an All India Judicial Service have to be achieved as early as possible. We adjourn this matter to enable the Union of India to initiate urgent action in this behalf and try to ensure that the objective is achieved. Re: Pool Transport: 4. In regard to the direction for pro 577 viding pool transport it appears that the State Governments have not complied with that direction and some of them have rested content by paying an allowance. What is essential is that the direction should be complied with so that the objective of providing transport to judicial officers is met. We would expect the State Governments to complete this process latest by 1.8.95. 5. We want to impress upon the State Governments that we have been quite lenient and indulgent so far and have ex tended the time more than once. We now mean business. It should be impressed upon the Chief Secretary of every State Government/Union Territory that it will be his/her responsibility to see to it that these directions are complied with without any further delay failing which we may be compelled to initiate drastic action.

This writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution is filed by the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) for the issuance of an appropriate direction instituting a judicial enquiry to enquire into the incidents mentioned in the writ petition and to further direct the respondents (Union of India and State of Manipur) to take action against the erring police officers. A direction for awarding compensation to the members of the family of the deceased is also prayed for. 2. The petitioner says that on 3rd April, 1991 a fake encounter was staged by the Imphal District Police in Lunthilian village in Churachandpur District wherein two persons viz., Lalbeiklien s/o Thatngur of Lunthilian village and Saikaplien, s/o Tenga of Tingbum village of Mizoram were killed. It is alleged that a false FIR was lodged by the District Police at Imphal Police Station at 4.30 p.m. on 4.4.1991 wherein it was alleged that on receipt of reliable information to the effect that some hardcore leaders of the Hamar People’s Convention (HPC) were camping at Lunthilian village, they rushed to the village on 3.4.91 and that when they reached the village at about 11.00 p.m. on that day, they were fired upon by the members of the HPC. It was alleged that in the exchange of fire, the two aforesaid persons died made three others were apprehended. It was also stated that the police recovered a.22 country revolver with seven rounds of ammunition, a cash amount of Rs. 1,213/- and a large number of incriminating document-,. It is stated by the petitioner in the writ petition that the above version of the police is strongly denied by the relatives of the said deceased persons. According to them, no encounter as such took place in the village and not a single shot was fired. According to them, the said two deceased persons were taken away by the police and killed in a cold-blooded manner and that this version is corroborated by villagers   of 3 who were present when be said persons were taken away and also from the various reports appearing in the local and national media. According to the petitioner further the true case is that the Police came to the village at about 9.30 p.m. on that day and took away five persons including the two deceased. They took away the Chairman of the Village also with them, but he was let-off on the out 366 skirts of the village. Remaining five persons were taken away in a truck after blindfolding them. At about 2.00 p.m. on 4.4.91, i.e., after travelling for about 16 hours and after crossing the Lanva Bridge which is about 5 km. from Churachandpur, the two deceased were called by the police and taken away from the back They, were taken to some distance and shot there. The remaining three persons in the truck heard the gunshots. Subsequently, the dead bodies were dumped in the truck and taken to Imphal where the other three persons were kept in the Imphal Police Station for four days. Then they were taken to Churachandpur Police Station and were kept there for about 9 days. They were then brought back to Imphal Police Station and lodged in the Imphal Central Jail. Ten days later they were taken to Mizoram where they were released on bail on 22.7.1991. The affidavits of two of the said three persons, viz., Remthang and Lalsansuot, sworn before the Judicial Magistrate, 1 Class on 20th August, 1991, are filed alongwith the writ petition. Affidavits of villagers and wives of the deceased are also filed in support of the above version. The writ petition then sets out, what it calls, the serious lacunae, irregularities and inconsistencies in the version put forward by the police, vide para 7 of the writ petition. 3. On 13th November, 1992 this Court issued notice to the respondents in this writ petition returnable within six weeks. A counter-affidavit has been filed on behalf of the second respondent (State of Manipur) sworn to by Shri Kh. Mohendro Singh, Joint Secretary (Home) Government of Manipur. He has denied the several averments in the writ petition and has affirmed the version put forward in the FIR as the true one. Alongwith the counter-affidavit, copies of postmortem reports relating to the said two deceased persons are filed. 4. A rejoinder has been filed on behalf of the petitioner denying the averments in the counter affidavit and reiterating the statements made in the writ petition. Alongwith the rejoinder some more affidavits have been filed. 5. It would be evident from a perusal of the pleadings that there is a serious dispute as to relevant facts. One of the aspects stressed by Shri Rajender Sachar, learned senior advocate for the petitioner is that according to the postmortem report filed by the respondents, not only the entry point of all the bullets is in the back of the deceased, there is blackening, tattooing and scrooting in respect of one of the bullet entry points pertaining to Beiklin. The learned counsel submits that the said circumstance supports the petitioner’s case that the said deceased were shot from behind and at a close range. 6. The learned counsel for the respondent, however, disputes the correctness of the said submission. 7. In view of the aforesaid two contradictory versions, we think it appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case that an enquiry is made by the learned District and Sessions Judge, Churachandpur, State of Manipur into the said incident. The learned District Judge shall record the  Page 3 of 3 evidence of the relevant witnesses and submit a report to this Court within six months. To enable the teamed District Judge to appreciate the facts of the case and also to enable him to identify the witnesses to be 367 summoned, copies of writ petition, counter and rejoinder alongwith the enclosed documents and affidavits shall be forwarded to him. The learned District Judge shall examine the deponents of the said affidavits, if they are available and willing to come forward to give evidence, And all such persons as he thinks appropriate in the circumstances and make his report. 8.

In view of the aforesaid two contradictory versions, we think it appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case that an enquiry is made by the learned District and Sessions Judge, Churachandpur, State of Manipur into the said incident. The learned District Judge shall record the  Page 3 of 3 evidence of the relevant witnesses and submit a report to this Court within six months. To enable the teamed District Judge to appreciate the facts of the case and also to enable him to identify the witnesses to be 367 summoned, copies of writ petition, counter and rejoinder alongwith the enclosed documents and affidavits shall be forwarded to him. The learned District Judge shall examine the deponents of the said affidavits, if they are available and willing to come forward to give evidence, And all such persons as he thinks appropriate in the circumstances and make his report. 8. It is obvious that before commencing the enquiry, die learned District Judge shall send notices to the petitioners as well as the respondents. 9.

(J)","JUDGMENT: MRS. SUJATA V. MANOHAR J.. 1.These appeals by special leave from a common judgment of the High Court of the Orissa in seven Reference Applications before it under Section 27(1) the Wealth Tax 1957. The High Court was required to consider the following question: ""Whether the word ’jewellery’ in section 5(1)(viii) of the Wealth-Tax Act, 1957 prior to the amendment of the section and the introduction of the Explanation by the Finance Act (No.2) of’ 1971 could take in gold ornaments without precious or semiprecious stones embedded on them?"" The High Court has answered the question thus: ""The word ’jewellery’ in section 5(1)(viii) of the Wealth Tax Act of 1957 prior to amendment of the provision and introduction of Explanation 1 by the Finance Act (No.2) of 1971 would not take in gold ornaments without precious or semi-precious stones embedded on them."" The Commissioner of Wealth Tax has filed the present appeals from the above decision. 2. The relevant assessment years are 1965-66 to 1971-72. The relevant valuation dates are 31st of March of each of the years in question. We are, therefore, required to consider the provisions of Section 5(1)(, viii) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 as in force during the relevant period. Section 5 of the Wealth Tax Act. 1957 deals with exemptions from wealth tax granted In respect of certain assets. Section 5(i)(Viii), prior to its amendment by the Finance Act 2 of 1971, was follows : ""5(i) : Subject to the provisions of sub section (1A) weath-tax shall not be payable by an assessee in respect of the following   of 4 assets, and such assets shall not be included in the net wealth of the assessee (1) x x x x x 508 x x x x x (viii) furniture, household utensils, wearing apparel, provisions and other articles intended for the personal or household use of the assessee. "" Section 5(1)(viii) was interpreted in the context of the provisions of Section 5(1)(xiii) and 5(i)(xv) by this Court in the case of Commissioner of Wealth-Tax Gujarat v. Arundhati Balakrishna (77 ITR 505). The Court said that jewellery intended for the personal use of the assessee would come within the scope of the exemption granted under Section 5(1)(viii) -- being ""other articles intended for the personal....... use of the assessee."" As a consequence, the Finance Act 2 of 1971 amended the provisions of Section 5(1)(viii) with retrospective effect from 1st of April, 1963, to read as follows : ""5(1)(viii):furniture, household utensils, wearing apparel, provisions and other articles intended for the personal or household use of the assessee, but not including jewellery."" (underlining ours) By the same Finance Act of 1971, Explanation 1 was also added to Section 5(1)(viii). The Explanation, however, was made effective only prospectively, with effect from 1.4.1972. Explanation 1 is as follows : ""Explanation 1 : For the purposes of this clause and clause (xiii), ’’jewellery’ in cludes (a) ornaments made of gold, silver, platinum or any other precious metal or any alloy containing one or more of such precious metals, whether or not containing any precious or semi-precious stone, and whether or not worked or sewn into any wearing apparel; (b) precious or semi-precious. stones, whether or not set in any furniture untensil or other article or worked or sewn into any wearing apparel."" 3. In the present appeals we are concerned with the period during which the retrospectively amended Section 5(1)(viii) was in operation but without Explanation 1 (which came into effect from 1st of April, 1972). We have to consider what is excluded from the benefit of the exemption granted under Section 5(1)(viii). Is it only those items of jewellery which are studded with precious or semi-precious stones or whether all ornaments and jewellery made out of precious metals (such as gold, silver or platinum or alloys with precious metals) are excluded from the exemption, although they may not be studded with precious or semi-precious stones? 4.It has been urged before us by the assessee that it is on account of Explanation 1 to Section 5(1)(viii) that the term ""jewellery"" would also include ornaments made only of gold, silver, platinum or any other precious metal or alloy containing such precious metal, even though no precious stones arc embedded in them. It is submitted that in the absence of such an Explanation during the relevant period, the term ""jewellery"" would cover only ornaments studded with jewels or precious stones. It would not cover in its ambit ornaments made only of gold, silver, platium or any other precious metal or alloy.  Page 3 of 4 5.To interpret the word ""jewellery"" as such without the benefit of Explanation 1, 509 we must first consider how the term ""jewellery"" is ordinarily understood the New Shorter Oxford Dictionary ""jewellery"" is defined as : ""gems or ornaments made or sold by jewellers, especially precious stones in mountings; jewels collectively or as a form of adornment. "" ""Jewel"" is defined as: ""An article or value used for (personal) adornment, especially one made of gold, silver, or precious stones............. a pre cious stone, a gem; especially one worn as an ornament. "" The term ""jewel"" and ""jewellery"", therefore, refer to articles of value for adornment, especially those made from gold, silver or precious stones. The terms are, therefore, wide enough to cover not merely precious stones or articles of adornment made with the use of precious stones, but also other articles of value made from gold, silver, platinum or precious metals. Ordinarily speaking, when a person talks about jewellery, he includes ornaments which arc made of gold, silver or any other precious metal also irrespective of whether these articles have precious stones embedded in them or not. 6.The difference which is sought to be made out between ornaments which contain precious stones, and ornaments of gold, silver and platinum which do not have precious stones embedded in them, appears to be artificial. The term ""jewellery"" is not confined in ordinary parlance to only those ornaments which have precious stones embodded in them. It covers all articles of value used for adornment. A jewellery shop normarlly sells not just precious stories or articles made of precious stones; it certainly sells ornaments of gold and silver. It may be that in our local languages, different kinds of bangles, necklaces and other ornaments carry different and specific names depending upon their design and craftsmanship. But these are all covered by the generic term ""jewellery."" 7. Undoubtedly, the Explanation has been introduced by the Finance Act of 1971, partly to clarify this position. The explanation provides an extensive definition of ""jewellery."" It includes ornaments made of gold, silver, platinum or any other precious metal whether or not containing any precious or semi-precious stones. It also covers, within the meaning of the term, such items which may or may not be sewn into any wearing apparel. It also includes precious and semiprecious stones whether or not set many furniture, utensils or other article, or worked or sewn into any wear ing apparel. The Explanation may have extended the meaning of ""jewellery"" to cover, for example, precious stones by themselves or precious stones set in furniture or utensils. But insofar as it includes ornaments made of gold, silver, platinum or any other precious metal or alloy, it is merely clarificatory in nature. Merely because ornaments made of gold and silver are now expressly included in Explanation 1, it is not possible to hold that they were earlier excluded from the meaning of the term ""jewellery."" 8. In the case of Commissioner of Wealth-Tax, Delhi-II v. Smt. Savitri Devi (140 ITR 525), a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court held that the word ""jewellery"" as set out in the dictionaries and as understood in common parlance, includes gold  Page 4 of 4 510 ornaments made for personal use. These are almost always a jeweller’s job and cannot be made by anyone. The Delhi High Court has held that the Explanation cannot take away the ordinary meaning of the word ""jewellery"". The artificially enlarged meaning as given by the definition in Explanation 1 also includes, by way of abundant caution, the natural meaning of the term. hence jewellery, even before coming into force of the Explanation 1, would include gold ornaments. We agree with the reasoning of the Delhi High Court. This view is reiterated in Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Delhi-III. v. Rukmani Devi(142 ITR 41). 9.A similar view has been taken by the Gujarat High Court in the case of Commissioner of’ Wealth-Tax. Gujarat L v. Jayantilal Amratlal (102 ITR 105); by the Allahabad High Court in the case of Commissioner of Wealth-Tax, Lucknow v. His Highness Maharaja Vibhuti Narain Singh (117 FIR 246), and by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of Nandkishore Girdharilal Modi. v. Commissioner of Wealth-Tax, M.P. (132 ITR 868). Another Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of Commissioner of Wealth-Tax, MP. v. Smt. Sonal K. Amin (127 ITR 427) has, however, taken a con"" view. The Calcutta High Court has also taken a contrary view in the case of Commissioner of Wealth-Tax, West Bengal 1, Calcutta v. Aditya Vikrant Birla 14 ITR 711. For the reasons which we have set out above, we do not agree with the contrary view expressed by the Calcutta High Court in Aditya vikram Birla’s case (supra) and by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Sonal K. Amin’s Case (supra). The Calcutta High Court has placed some emphasis on different vernacular terms used for different types of ornaments. In our view, this is not, in any manner, conclusive of the question whether the term ""jewellery"" includes ornaments made of precious metals such as gold or silver. The contrary decisions arc, therefore, overruled, 10.In the premises, the appeals are allowed with costs","JUDGMENT: MRS. SUJATA V.

"" Section 5(1)(viii) was interpreted in the context of the provisions of Section 5(1)(xiii) and 5(i)(xv) by this Court in the case of Commissioner of Wealth-Tax Gujarat v. Arundhati Balakrishna (77 ITR 505). The Court said that jewellery intended for the personal use of the assessee would come within the scope of the exemption granted under Section 5(1)(viii) -- being ""other articles intended for the personal....... use of the assessee."" As a consequence, the Finance Act 2 of 1971 amended the provisions of Section 5(1)(viii) with retrospective effect from 1st of April, 1963, to read as follows : ""5(1)(viii):furniture, household utensils, wearing apparel, provisions and other articles intended for the personal or household use of the assessee, but not including jewellery."" (underlining ours) By the same Finance Act of 1971, Explanation 1 was also added to Section 5(1)(viii). The Explanation, however, was made effective only prospectively, with effect from 1.4.1972. Explanation 1 is as follows : ""Explanation 1 : For the purposes of this clause and clause (xiii), ’’jewellery’ in cludes (a) ornaments made of gold, silver, platinum or any other precious metal or any alloy containing one or more of such precious metals, whether or not containing any precious or semi-precious stone, and whether or not worked or sewn into any wearing apparel; (b) precious or semi-precious. stones, whether or not set in any furniture untensil or other article or worked or sewn into any wearing apparel."" 3. In the present appeals we are concerned with the period during which the retrospectively amended Section 5(1)(viii) was in operation but without Explanation 1 (which came into effect from 1st of April, 1972).

MANOHAR, JJ. 1.The appellants. had filed a suit being G.S.No.159/83 before the Additional Munsiff, Guntur to evict the respondent from their property consisting of vacant site, zinc sheet shed and Saw mill machinery which had been leased in the year 1967 to the respondent under an oral lease. The property is situated in Guntur Town, Nagarmelem Old Ward No. 17, New ward No. 23, Block No. 14, TS No.411. The respondent contended, inter alia, that the Civil Court had no Jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit-, the Rent Controller alone had jurisdiction in the matter under, the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Buildings(Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960. The respondent also contended that there was no valid quit notice, that he was entitled to continue in the suit premises till April, 1986 and that the appellants did not require the premises for their personal use as was contended by them. The Additional Munsiff, Guntur decreed the suit of the appellants. He held that the tenancy was from month to month and the quit notice was valid. He also held that the lease in question was in relation to land and machinery. The zinc sheet shed being only an accessory to the main lease hold premises, being meant for covering the machinery, the lease in question did not come within the purview of the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960. 2.Being aggrieved by this judgments and order, the respondent preferred an appeal before the District Court at Guntur. The District Judge, however, confirmed the findings of the Munsiff’s Court and dismissed the appeal. 3.The respondent preferred a second appeal before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh challenging the concurrent findings of the two courts below. The High Court came to the conclusion that the lease was in respect of a building as defined in the Andhra Pradesh(Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960 and hence the Civil Court had no   of 4 jurisdiction to entertain the suit. On this ground, the appeal of the respondent was allowed by the High Court. The present appeal is from this judgment and order of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. 4.The narrow question before us is whether the lease in question is of a building as defined in the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1961 Section 2 (iii) of the said Act defines a building thus: ""2 (iii): ’building, means any house or hut or part of a house or hut, let or to be let separately for residential or non-residential purpose and includes (a) the gardens, grounds, garages and out houses, if any, appurtenant to such house, hut or part of such house or hut and let or to be let along with such house or hut or part of such house or hut; (b) any furniture supplied or any fittings affixed by the landlord for use in such house or hut or part of a house or hut, but does not include a room in a hotel or boarding house;"" 5. It is contended by the respondent that the zinc sheet shed which covers the machinery was leased out to him by the appellants. The shed falls within the defini 331 tion of building under Section 2 (iii). This contention requires examination. 6.There is no written lease in the present case. The case of the appellants throughout has been that what was leased out to the respondent was their Saw mill machinery and land consisting of approximately 10,000 square yards. The Saw mill machinery was covered by a zinc sheet shed to protect the machinery. The lease was essentially a lease of the Saw mill machinery. It was not a lease of a house or a hut. In the plaint in paragraph 111, the property which has been leased out is described thus: ""the property mentioned in the schedule annexed consists of vacant site, zinc sheet shed and machinery belonging to the first plaintiff herein............. The schedule to the plaint describes the property as: ""Guntur town, Nagaramelem old ward No. 17, ward No.23, Block No. 14, TS No.411, total area 10156 square feet municipal assessment No. 22214 bounded by West : Compound Wall in this site; and Rakulu of ILTD Co., 105’.08’ South : Road and gate and compound wall 70’ West : Compound Wall in this Rakulu of ILTD Co., 106’ North : Compound Wall and Rakulu zinc sheet shed 60’ - 06"" within the above boundaries wherein there zinc doria rakulu shed, with saw mill with all accessories attached to the mill, 10 Hp Electric motor, current connection metre etc.,"" 7. The case of the appellants throughout has, therefore, been that the land together with Saw mill and accessories attached to the Saw mill covered by zinc doria rakulu shed was leased out to the respondent. The trial court came to the conclusion that it was the Saw mill with machinery covered with zinc sheet which was taken on lease by the respondent in 1967. It came to the conclusion that the mere fact the machinery of the Saw mill was housed in a zinc  Page 3 of 4 sheet shed will not make the lease that of a non-residential building within the meaning of Section 2 of the said Act. The same view has bean upheld by the Appellate Court. The appellate Court has also observed that there is no dispute with regard to the description of the property leased out as made out in the plaint and the schedule to it, It has also held that the respondent had taken the Saw mill machinery and the schedule property on lease for doing Saw mill business. 8. Learned counsel for the appellants also produced before us the deposition of witnesses examined between the trial court. The second plaintiff in his examination - in chief has said that the property leased out is a vacant site along with Saw mill shed. In his cross-examination he has reiterated that only the machines and shed were leased out. The defendant had constructed an office in the premises later on. The defendant in his examination -in- chief has also deposed that he took the schedule site on lease in 1967 for doing timber business. He has said that when he took the premises on lease, there was a saw mill machine and shed. He has further stated that he constructed an office room in the, premises after he took the premises on 332 lease. In his cross examination, the defendant had stated that die shed is erected to house the machinery. 9. Looking to this evidence, it is clear that the shed, which has a zinc sheet roof, was erected only to protect the Saw mill machinery. What was leased out to the respondent was substantially the Saw mill machinery for the purpose of carrying on timber/ Saw mill business. The shed was merely erected to shelter the machinery. The dominant purpose of the lease was to lease out the Saw mill machinery. In order that the lease should be covered by the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960, the lease should be of a building as defined in Section 2 (iii). It should, therefore, be lease of any house or a hut or a part of a house or a hut let for residential or nonresidential purposes. It would include gardens, grounds, garages and out-houses appurtenant to such a house or a hut. In the present case, however, the lease is not of any house or a hut or part of a house or a hut. The lease is of saw mill machinery which is covered by a zinc sheet shed. The dominant purpose of die lease is to lease (mat the machinery. The shed is only an adjunct It is also pointed out that a covering over the machinery in the shape of a structure consisting of zinc shows supported on poles can hardly be called a house or even a hut In any case, looking to the dominant purpose of the lease, the two courts below have rightly come to the conclusion that the lease is not covered by the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease Rent and Eviction Control Act, 1960. 10. The respondent relied upon a decision of a Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of Mohammad Jaffar Ali v. S. Rajeswara Rao (1971) 1 Andhra Pradesh Weekly Reports 194). In that case, there was a lease of die cinema theatre. The Court held that the lease was essentially a demise of the building with accessories like furniture and machinery, the dominant purpose of the demise was to lease the cinema theatre building and hence, the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960 apply to such a lease. In the present case, the dominant purpose is clearly to lease out the Saw mill machinery. A zinc sheet shed which has been erected merely to cover the machinery, cannot be a pre dominant reason for the lease. The High Court, therefore,  Page 4 of 4 was not right in coming to the conclusion that the lease was governed by the provisions of Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent, and Eviction) Control Act, 1960. 11.The appeal is therefore, allowed. The impugned judgment and order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dated 20.2.1992 is set aside and the judgment and the order dated 2.4.1990 of the third Additional District Judge, Guntur is confirmed. The respondent shall pay to the appellants costs of the appeal","JUDGMENT: MRS. SUJATA V.

The shed falls within the defini 331 tion of building under Section 2 (iii). This contention requires examination. 6.There is no written lease in the present case. The case of the appellants throughout has been that what was leased out to the respondent was their Saw mill machinery and land consisting of approximately 10,000 square yards. The Saw mill machinery was covered by a zinc sheet shed to protect the machinery. The lease was essentially a lease of the Saw mill machinery. It was not a lease of a house or a hut. In the plaint in paragraph 111, the property which has been leased out is described thus: ""the property mentioned in the schedule annexed consists of vacant site, zinc sheet shed and machinery belonging to the first plaintiff herein............. The schedule to the plaint describes the property as: ""Guntur town, Nagaramelem old ward No. 17, ward No.23, Block No. 14, TS No.411, total area 10156 square feet municipal assessment No. 22214 bounded by West : Compound Wall in this site; and Rakulu of ILTD Co., 105’.08’ South : Road and gate and compound wall 70’ West : Compound Wall in this Rakulu of ILTD Co., 106’ North : Compound Wall and Rakulu zinc sheet shed 60’ - 06"" within the above boundaries wherein there zinc doria rakulu shed, with saw mill with all accessories attached to the mill, 10 Hp Electric motor, current connection metre etc.,"" 7. The case of the appellants throughout has, therefore, been that the land together with Saw mill and accessories attached to the Saw mill covered by zinc doria rakulu shed was leased out to the respondent. The trial court came to the conclusion that it was the Saw mill with machinery covered with zinc sheet which was taken on lease by the respondent in 1967. It came to the conclusion that the mere fact the machinery of the Saw mill was housed in a zinc  Page 3 of 4 sheet shed will not make the lease that of a non-residential building within the meaning of Section 2 of the said Act. The same view has bean upheld by the Appellate Court. The appellate Court has also observed that there is no dispute with regard to the description of the property leased out as made out in the plaint and the schedule to it, It has also held that the respondent had taken the Saw mill machinery and the schedule property on lease for doing Saw mill business. 8. Learned counsel for the appellants also produced before us the deposition of witnesses examined between the trial court. The second plaintiff in his examination - in chief has said that the property leased out is a vacant site along with Saw mill shed. In his cross-examination he has reiterated that only the machines and shed were leased out. The defendant had constructed an office in the premises later on. The defendant in his examination -in- chief has also deposed that he took the schedule site on lease in 1967 for doing timber business. He has said that when he took the premises on lease, there was a saw mill machine and shed. He has further stated that he constructed an office room in the, premises after he took the premises on 332 lease. In his cross examination, the defendant had stated that die shed is erected to house the machinery. 9. Looking to this evidence, it is clear that the shed, which has a zinc sheet roof, was erected only to protect the Saw mill machinery. What was leased out to the respondent was substantially the Saw mill machinery for the purpose of carrying on timber/ Saw mill business. The shed was merely erected to shelter the machinery. The dominant purpose of the lease was to lease out the Saw mill machinery. In order that the lease should be covered by the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960, the lease should be of a building as defined in Section 2 (iii). It should, therefore, be lease of any house or a hut or a part of a house or a hut let for residential or nonresidential purposes. It would include gardens, grounds, garages and out-houses appurtenant to such a house or a hut. In the present case, however, the lease is not of any house or a hut or part of a house or a hut. The lease is of saw mill machinery which is covered by a zinc sheet shed. The dominant purpose of die lease is to lease (mat the machinery. The shed is only an adjunct It is also pointed out that a covering over the machinery in the shape of a structure consisting of zinc shows supported on poles can hardly be called a house or even a hut In any case, looking to the dominant purpose of the lease, the two courts below have rightly come to the conclusion that the lease is not covered by the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease Rent and Eviction Control Act, 1960. 10. The respondent relied upon a decision of a Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of Mohammad Jaffar Ali v. S. Rajeswara Rao (1971) 1 Andhra Pradesh Weekly Reports 194). In that case, there was a lease of die cinema theatre. The Court held that the lease was essentially a demise of the building with accessories like furniture and machinery, the dominant purpose of the demise was to lease the cinema theatre building and hence, the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960 apply to such a lease. In the present case, the dominant purpose is clearly to lease out the Saw mill machinery. A zinc sheet shed which has been erected merely to cover the machinery, cannot be a pre dominant reason for the lease. The High Court, therefore,  Page 4 of 4 was not right in coming to the conclusion that the lease was governed by the provisions of Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent, and Eviction) Control Act, 1960. 11.The appeal is therefore, allowed. The impugned judgment and order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dated 20.2.1992 is set aside and the judgment and the order dated 2.4.1990 of the third Additional District Judge, Guntur is confirmed. The respondent shall pay to the appellants costs of the appeal"
